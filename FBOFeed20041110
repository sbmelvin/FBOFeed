<DESC>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 Elements of the work include NAICS 238190, therefore bidders should review the requirement to determine if they can perform the work listed, and are interested in this requirement.   The Pre-solicitation notice for Solicitation No. 05SI101583 is currently available.  This requirement is not set-aside, and award will be pursuant to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The size standard is $28.5 million. The estimated price range of the work is $250,000 to $500,000.  The work is located at Grand Coulee Dam, Columbia Basin Project, Grand Coulee, Washington.  Principal components of the work include:  1. Furnish and install fire retardant EPS foam in two drum gates; 2.  Fabricate and install steel framing for inspection galleries in the two drum gates.  NOTE:  The Government had similar work performed at Grand Coulee Dam in 1998.  At that time a construction chute was used to slide the fire retardant EPS foam down to the drum gate(s).  This method appeared to work well and we believe significantly decreased the time necessary to perform the work.  The solicitation will be available on CD-ROM in Adobe Acrobat format and will be available on or about November 30, 2004, (this is an estimated date).  To obtain a copy of the CD and be included on the planholder list, interested bidders must register on our website at www.pn.usbr.gov/contracts/construction.   Visit the website to obtain further instructions about registering.  If you don=t provide your DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System) and TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number) on the electronic registration form, we will not send the solicitation to you.  Telephone requests for the solicitation won=t be accepted.   There is no charge for the first copy of the CD and $15 for each additional copy requested.  We reserve the right to issue the solicitation on paper if it becomes necessary.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by this agency.  Notice:  Pursuant to guidance from the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of the Interior, after October 1, 2002, Government contracts will only be awarded to contractors registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.  You may register on-line, easily and quickly, at www.ccr.gov/vendor.cfm.

This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Proposers should state in their proposal that it is submitted in response to th is BAA. Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD/SERDPs intent to competitively fund research and development for innovative and new environmental technologies that meet the focus areas set forth in the SERDP Program Announcement. T he Program Announcement can be found on the DoD/SERDP Home Page accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.serdp.org/funding/nonfed. No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards may t ake the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. Before preparing a proposal, potential proposers should read the information provided in the SERDP Program Announcem ent for details regarding proposal submission, the evaluation of proposals, and the individual Statements of Need (SON). Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The government will not pay for any costs associated wit h the preparation of proposals nor travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal, including a signed original copy, plus six (6 ) additional copies to: Dr. Robert Holst, SERDP Program Office, 901 North Stuart Street, Suite 303, Arlington, VA 22203-1821, 703-696-2127. Pre-proposals sent via fax or electronic mail will be rejected. Pre-proposals must be received no later than 4:00 PM  EST on Thursday, January 6, 2005. They must be in abstract form describing the merits and objectives of the proposers project. The abstract should concisely describe what the proposer has to offer the SERDP Program and discuss (1) the proposed objective( s) and approach with a clear identification of overall innovation and scientific/ technical merits; (2) the proposers capabilities and related experience, or unique combination of these which are integral factors in achieving a proposed objective; and (3)  the qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), team leader(s), or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the proposal. Pre-proposals should be no longer than five pages (not including the cover page), single sid ed, and 11 point. One attachment of up to three single sided pages of test data may also be submitted. The cover page must be completed and entered via the website at https://sems.serdp-estcp.org/index.jsp  in the format specified in the Instructions. At a  minimum, the pre-proposals should contain: (1) a title, descriptive of the research to be performed; (2) the name and address of the individual, company or educational institution submitting the pre-proposal; (3) the abstract of the technical objective an d description of the approach including how the approach described satisfies the focused need in the SON; (4) the duration of the project along with a milestone chart with significant events; (5) the estimated labor cost, materials cost, burdens, and profi t (if any) by year; and (6) a one page curriculum vitae of the Principal Investigator(s) (not included in the five page pre-proposal count). Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by the Government, a submitter may be contacted for further information and may be encouraged to submit a full proposal by a set time and date. The format requirements for the full proposal are set forth in the Program Announcement on t he DOD SERDP Home Page. Each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to get initial Govern ment feedback on their technologies without the expense of a full proposal. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Multiple awards may be made to address a particular SON. It i s expected that awards totaling approximately $2.0 million will result. Pre-proposals and full proposals will be evaluated against the following factors, listed in descending order of importance: (1) SERDP relevance (PASS/FAIL) - whether the submission res ponds to high-priority, mission relevant, DoD and DOE environmental requirements as described in the SON; (2) the approach, objective(s) and overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed technology; (3) potential for transition of the proposed re search; (4) the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposed objectives; (5) realism of the proposed cost, and availability of funds; and (6) a vailability of other financial support for the proposed effort. For awards to be made as contracts, evaluation shall include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, HUD Zone small business, small di sadvantaged business, woman owned small business concerns, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAISC) code is 541710 with the small business size standard of 500 employ ees. In addition, contract proposals that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The point of con tact for this BAA for technical issues is Dr. Robert Holst, SERDP Program Office, 703-696-2127 and for non-technical issues is Ms. Alandra Jones, HECSA, 703-428-6551.

<DESC>PART ONE: The intent of this project is to upgrade the existing closed circuit television system and to replace the existing intrusion detection system (IDS).  The Government will supply as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) the cameras, and most of the major IDS parts (keypad, detectors, and repeaters).   NOTE:   You will supply the D9412G panel so price the job accordingly!  

The contractor will supply all tools, labor, connectors, brackets, parts not furnished (NEMA enclosures, hardware, step down transformers for cameras, etc. to make these systems fully operational.  The contractor is responsible for quoting this project with all necessary equipment to make these systems fully operational.   No additional monies will be paid for anything omitted from the bid provided to make the systems 100% operational.  

For the CCTV system we estimate that there are 16 cameras to replace.  Our expectation is that the existing cameras will be removed and replaced with Extreme EX82 cameras provided by The Government.   This will require 110 VAC to 24 VAC step down transformers, mounts, brackets, NEMA enclosures, DITEK surge protection, brackets, wire protection, etc.  The Government will be providing the cameras and the standard brackets as shipped from the manufacturer.   If the cable and wire is acceptable, then it may be reused.  If it is not acceptable, the contractor will be responsible to replace it with new wire/cable.   New BNC connectors will be supplied by and installed by the contractor, on both the camera side and the recorder side.   You should also provide for disposal of the old cameras, and housings.  There is a DVR Innovations DVRI120 Digital Video Recorder with RAID that the cameras will be landed onto.   Contractor is responsible for setting the display property per camera, day and night, after the new cameras are installed.   Contractor will supply and install DITEK surge protection on the camera side – protecting power and video to the camera.  

For the IDS system we will supply and expect you to install a Radionics D9412G system, with Inovonics Wireless Devices.  We estimate the need to install approximately 40 wireless glassbreak detectors and approximately 13 wireless door contacts, and only one keypad on the front of the alarm control panel.  Some of these doors (like an overhead door for example) will require an external contact, wired to the inputs on the wireless transmitters.  

We will supply and expect you to install no less than 6 Inovonics Wireless Outdoor Repeaters.   We use the outdoor version because it provides some protection of the device from tampering.   If more repeaters are necessary, we will supply them and you will install them, up to a maximum of 12 repeaters.  
 

As an additional part of this job, we will require you to return, after an access system is installed, to take the outputs provided by that contractor and incorporate it into this alarm system.   This will also then allow you to remove the wireless door contacts and de-program them from the system, as the contractor doing the installation will have installed door position switches for the access system and provide outputs to this new alarm system.  This also means you will be expected to communicate clearly with the contractor (if not yourself) who is doing the access system, to coordinate the integration of both the new access system and new IDS system.  

PART TWO:
The intent of this project is to add two additional cameras to the existing CCTV system, and add a new digital video recorder with RAID system.   The Government will NOT provide equipment on this part of the job.    

The new cameras you will be providing will be placed on the sides of the building, looking at the two side exit doors that mirror each other.   

The idea for getting the video signal back to the head end is to utilize a product from FM SYSTEMS, which will allow two video signals over a single coax.   Since cameras existing near this location, it would be prudent to install the FM SYSTEMS plexing transmitter device with a short cable run to the nearest camera location AND then install the receiving unit at the head end.   This will need to be done on each new side camera.   So in other words, two receivers and two transmitters will need to be utilized.   This will save lots of time and money vs. installing new coax cabling back to the head end.   Contact information and specific details are contained later in this document.   

We will also require a new digital video recorder (DVR), with RAID computer, to be installed.   The model will be a unit manufactured by DVR Innovations – contact information and specific details are contained later in this document.   

The contractor will supply all tools, labor, connectors, brackets, parts, NEMA enclosures, hardware, step down transformers for cameras, etc to make this work successfully.    The contractor is responsible for quoting this project with all necessary equipment and labor to make these systems fully operational.   No additional monies will be paid for anything omitted from the bid provided, to make the system 100% operational.  Project range is between $40,000.00 - $70,000.00.

A pre-bid meeting/walkthrough is scheduled for November 19, 2004 at 10:00 A.M. Proposals are due on December 29th 2004 at 4:30 P.M. 


Solicitation package will be available on or about November 22, 2004.  Please email your request to the attention of Ms. Ana Garcia only at ana.garcia@gsa.gov or send fax to (215) 446-6077.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for demonstrating through comparison to test data that the Energy Boundary Element Analysis (EBEA) can predict accurately the acoustic field in the vicinity of an aircraft due to noise emitted from its engines.  The EBEA computational capability will be enhanced by introducing mean flow effects in the formulation.  A compiled version of the EBA code will be delivered at the end of the project along with a user's manual and example data files.  The enhanced and validated EBEA code will allow NASA engineers to assess very efficiently the effects from the following design parameters on the radiated niose: (1)  Number of engines on an aircraft (2)  Locations of the engines (3)  Shape of aircraft Since typical computational times for the EBEA software are of the order of minutes on a typical workstation, it will be possible to incorporate the EBEA computations in optimization analyses.	In the past, the EBEA method has been employed for computing the exterior acoustic field in the vicinity of an automotive vehicle due to air-borne noise sources in the 400Hz-20,000Hz frequency range.	The EBEA has also been used sucessfully for computing the noise radiated from a submersible vehichle. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase these research and development services from The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor MI; the only known source for this type of research and development capability.  The University of Michigan has extensive experience applying this particular methodology to ground vehicles, which is critical to the success of this project. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 26, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

STATEMENT OF WORK: MODULAR WEARABLE COMPUTER (MOWC) 1.0 SCOPE:  The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) located at Quantico, Virginia, requires an integrated Modular Wearable Computer (MOWC) to provide for the collective operation, monitoring and system status/telemetry data feed of the following unmanned sensor s! ystems: Dragon Runner Mobile Ground Sensor/UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle), SUSS/UGS (Small Unit Sensor System/Unattended Ground Sensors) and the Dragon Eye (DE) UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).  This Statement of Work (SOW) requires the contractor to provide the necessary personnel to accomplish the tasks described below. 2.0 BACKGROUND: In today's modern battle spaces, where potential enemies understand the United States (US) strengths and capitalize on the asymmetric nature of specific areas, small unit leaders will increasingly enter these hostile environments and encounter life-threatening situations.  The Marine Corps Warfighting Lab recognizes that tactical units need an organic suite of unmanned low-risk system capabilities to conduct Reconnaissance Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA) in these complex environments.  It is believed that an integrated MOWC will assist this mission by providing real-time RSTA data, increasing the using unit's overall situational awarene! ss.  This coverage, executed by an organic suite of remote sensors, and controlled/monitored off of one central MOWC, will provide observational data of confined/distant areas where human access is impractical or unsustainable, mitigating risk to the Marines normally carrying out these missions.  Fully functional prototypes of these unmanned systems (Dragon Runner UGV and SUSS) are being developed and demonstrated by the National Robotics Engineering Consortium, Carnegie Mellon University Robotic's Institute and the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL).  The Dragon Eye UAV, currently under system enhancement by MCWL as produced by AeroVironment, Inc, is formerly a program of record within Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia (VA).  In order to support continued experimentation by MCWL RSTA Technology section, one integrated MOWC (to include description, specifications, engineering support and operation instructions) is required for experimentation.  The MCW! L will conduct experiments to determine the efficacy of such a computer system at the Marine small unit level. 3.0 OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain one MOWC, to include descriptions, specifications, operation instructions that works with the Dragon Runner UGV, SUSS and Dragon Eye UAV systems, and to require and fund the Non-Recurring Expenses (NRE) associated with the integrated MOWC system, if any. 4.0 BASIC REQUIREMENTS:  4.1 The Contractor shall deliver (ideally within 4 months but no later than 6 months of contract award) one Modular Wearable Computer (MOWC) system that will interface to the RF components that operate Dragon Runner UGV, SUSS and Dragon Eye UAV unmanned systems and meets the following system specifications as listed below in 4.1.1 through 4.1.24. 4.2 The Contractor shall support integration testing of the MOWC with CMU Robotics Institute for the Dragon Runner UGV and hand-in place SUSS, and AeroVironment, Inc for the !

DELIVERY SCHEDULE- Each offer will be evaluated based on the ability to meet the stated requirements and delivery requirements.  PAST PERFORMANCE- this assessment will address an offer's past performance working on contracts of a similar size for similar support and of a similar complexity.  Timeliness of delivery and customer service will also be assessed within Past Performance.  PRICE - Price is not sc! ored and is not considered the most important factor.  However, the importance of price as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the remaining evaluation factors.  Further, after evaluation of the technical and price proposals, cost may be the deciding factor for selection, depending on whether a highly evaluated technical proposal warrants the evaluated price difference.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   EPA is issuing a sole source contract to LifeLine Group (LLG) for existing LifeLine software to be used and modified to allow the estimation of cumulative risk from pesticide exposures for Native American and Alaska American populations.  The LifeLine Group is the sole owner of the LifeLine software and holder of the copyright to the programs.  Under its classification as a 501(c)3 organization, such software assets do not accrue to the financial benefit of any employee or director of the LifeLine Group.  Under this contract, LLG will consult with Tribal  stakeholder representatives to develop a design to revise the LifeLine software to better represent tribal communities in two distinct biogeographical areas (BGAs).  Data and descriptive information will be collected and prepared for inclusion in the LifeLine software, the software will be  reprogrammed and beta tested, and LLG will provide training on the software for each BGA with appropriate training materials to course participants. LifeLine software is designed to evaluate aggregate exposures, doses and risks associated with the use of a pesticide active ingredient for a period  ranging from one day to a lifetime.  It is unlike other currently available risk assessment software in that it is "transparent", leaving data sources, assumptions, and other inputs to the software accessible to the user.  EPA and USDA supported the development of the initial versions of LifeLine  software through a cooperative agreement with the Hampshire Research Institute.  This agreement ended in August 2001 with the delivery of LifeLine Version 1.1 and an associated white paper.  Presently, a new version of the LifeLine software is being built, supported by funding in EPA's Office of  Pesticide Programs, Health Effects Division.  The new version will include the ability to import EPA residue file information for organophosphorous chemicals to run a cumulative risk assessment for organophosphorous chemicals. LifeLine risk assessment software is based on a concept of accurate  modeling of demographic, physical, environmental and activity characteristics of individuals in the population or sub-population of interest.  Data from many sources is used to quantitatively describe modeled individuals, in terms of physical characteristics, living environments, mobility  probabilities, eating habits, and other daily activities.  Existing versions of LifeLine and other similar risk assessment software use data descriptions that are representative of the "general public".  Sub-populations in unique living environments, with unique lifestyles and diets, may not be  represented in this data, and the risk assessments generated by these models may not be representative of such sub-populations.  This is the case for tribal communities which often utilize unique housing, and have unique food sources, mobility patterns, and physiological characteristics. The  LifeLine Group is actively revising and improving the software to better meet the needs of unique stakeholders.  For the current EPA Tribal LifeLine contract (68-W-02-051), LLG has demonstrated its commitment to this mission during the pilot project to create initial tribal exposure assessment  software.  That experience endowed the organization with a unique understanding of the environmental conditions and community lifestyles in the Native American tribes that present important exposure scenarios to the individuals in those communities.  LLG has learned first hand about dealing with  the difficult data access issues, cultural complications and communication styles that are inherent in such projects.  LLG has demonstrated that it can distinguish between tasks that can be achieved by the non-Indian scientists and those aspects where assistance is necessary from tribal  representatives and experienced EPA delegates.  This experience is unique for any technical group creating state-of-the-art exposure/risk assessment software, such as proposed for this contract. The programming components listed in the Statement of Work require the hiring of LLG to perform the  required modifications of the data to conform to LifeLine architecture and to modify the program code and supporting documentation. These tasks require an in depth and timely knowledge of the software programming structure and use of the copyrighted code.  The LifeLine Group is uniquely positioned  to complete this project.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Justificati on for sole-source is the contractor posession of proprietary information such as the original submittal and devlopment information. Award to any other source will result in the need to create submission data at a substantial duplication of cost to the Gov ernment the recovery of which is not likely through competition.  The Government would incur significant increase costs, liability and unacceptable delays without the services of Brown, Cunningham & Gannuch, Inc. during advertisement and construction of th is critical project.  Price range is between $25k and $100k.  Note:  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL

<DESC>Stage One has been completed and the following firms have been invited to participate in Stage Two.

Quinn Evans Architects: Ann Arbor, MI
Goody Clancy: Boston, MA
Hillier Architecture: Philadelphia, PA

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture with the modernization of the Potter Stewart U.S. Courthouse. Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services and preparation of design documents are required for this renovation project. The 9-story Courthouse, located at 5th and Walnut Street, in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, was completed in 1939. The estimated total construction cost for the project is approximately $30,000,000 to $40,000,000.

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project concept and design documents. The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept.

The project scope of work consists of the cleaning and repair of exterior walls, replacement and/or restoration of the historic façade and light court windows, and the replacement of the roof over the 9th floor. The project will require the removal of the cooling towers, chillers and associated pumps, and tanks as well as the replacement of the boilers. An emergency generator will be installed with this project and the existing sprinkler system will be extended throughout the remaining unsprinkled areas of the building. The defunct air handling unit (AHU) and associated ductwork in the basement will be removed. Included with the project is the abatement of any asbestos found during the demolition of the boilers, cooling towers, chillers and pumps. The project includes the renovation of two freight elevators, the replacement of generators and the modernization of the motors on 8 passenger and one freight elevators. The lighting levels in two level 8 courtrooms will be improved along with the addition of a new courtroom on the 1st floor and new chambers on the 2nd floor. A satellite Office for the U.S. Attorney and a Grand Jury Suite will be added as well as lobby and corridor renovations. Repairs to the exterior include the structural steel at the east ramp area, the exterior areaway, stair landings and sidewalks. Interior vestibule doors will be replaced to match the original historical doors. A new AHU will be added to the 1st floor courtroom with the addition of Direct Digital Controls (DDC) to the AHU in the Marshal’s spaces. Increased security will require the addition of motion sensors and security card access devices to the judges’ chamber doors. The restrooms will be brought up to Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). Tenant and common area signage will be upgraded with Braille. This work will all take place during evening hours and will require precise phasing so as not to disrupt the daily workings of the Courts. Also as part of the HVAC improvements, efforts will be undertaken to make this building LEED certified for sustainability, accessibility, and energy efficiency. 

The design A/E selected under this solicitation will design the planned modernization and renovation as described including at a minimum: site and system verification, analysis of previous investigative reports, tenant programming and space design, design concepts, design development, construction documentation, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering, partnering and Post Construction Contract Services (PCCS).  The scope may include: presentation to the national historic officials for approval; coordination of previous analysis and work performed at the Potter Stewart Courthouse; review, documentation, and discussion with the CMc team to ensure a smooth and complete transition of the desired design direction; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.  This project will be designed following GSA’s “Facility Standards for the Public Building Service”, the U.S. Courts Design Guide, the U. S. Marshal’s “Requirements and Specifications for Special Purpose and Support Space Manuals”, as well as any other affected tenant-agency’s security requirements.  This project will be designed to meet GSA energy goals and include sustainable design and construction practices using the LEED system as a guide.  

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:

STAGE I:    The first stage will establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and their Lead Designer. From the first stage, a minimum of three (3) A/E Design Firms will be selected for continuation into the stage two interviews. The short list will be based on the A/E Design Firm’s submittal in response to this Request for Qualifications.  The A/E Design Firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver Design Excellence within a historic structure and will express its design approach and philosophy. In Stage 1, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 inch format. The portfolio should include the following:  1. A cover letter referencing this FBO announcement and a brief description of the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; 2. The Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) modified to include only the information requested in this RFQ for Stage I. Identification of consultants is not required at this stage. Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:

(1)      PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):    The A/E Design Firm shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of projects completed within the past ten years.

The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how the historic preservation and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.    

(2)      LEAD DESIGNER’S PORTFOLIO (25%):    The Lead Designer shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of three (3) relevant projects each completed within the last ten years directly attributable to the Lead Designer. Narrative shall include a discussion of design challenges and solutions and be a good indicator of how well the Lead Designer worked with a sensitive and important client. The sample relevant projects shall clearly demonstrate sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century heritage buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how historic preservation (if any) and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.

(3)      PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%):    In the Lead Designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy, approach to the challenge of resolving historic preservation issues, and parameters that may apply specifically to the renovation and repair of mid-20th century heritage buildings. Also, discuss how design and the coordination of complex multiphase construction in occupied office space may affect their approach and design process. Include a discussion on how they would approach renovation work in sensitive, symbolic and secured spaces as found in the Federal agency spaces and judicial courtrooms and chambers.

(4)      LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%):    Submit a biographical sketch including education, professional experience and recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.

STAGE II:    For Stage II, the short listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage, the entire project team will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) including consultant information. An interview with each project team will be included in this stage.  During the interviews, A/E firms should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation criteria and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan. The Government will establish the detailed stage II evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due. A brief period, approximately three weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team. In developing the Stage II team, A/E firms are advised that they will be evaluated on whether at least 35% of the design effort will be within the designated geographical area of the State of Ohio.  Any arrangement toward this goal must be in place prior to the submittal of Stage II information.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The US Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP), provides federal leadership in developing the nation's capacity to prevent and control crime, improve the criminal and juvenile justice systems, increase knowledge about crime and related issues, and assist victims of crime.  Through the programs developed and funded by its bureaus and offices, OJP works to form partnerships among federal, state, and local government officials to control drug abuse and trafficking; reduce and prevent crime; rehabilitate neighborhoods; improve the administration of justice in America; meet the needs of victims of crime; and address problems such as gang violence, prison crowding, juvenile crime, and white-collar crime.  Among other programs, OJP sponsors information sharing initiatives to improve the effectiveness and fairness of the justice system through better information sharing among all its components, including juvenile justice, law enforcement, prosecution, defense, adult courts, corrections, probation and parole.  Justice leaders place top priority on integrating information systems in order to: improve the operational efficiency of the justice process among stakeholders & across jurisdictions; provide all justice personnel critical information needed for their safety and to enhance service in a cost-effective manner; and to allow decision-makers to uphold the fundamental ideals of the justice system.  One of the programs supported by OJP to meet its mission is the Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative (Global).  Global is a “group of groups”, representing more than thirty independent organizations spanning the spectrum of law enforcement, judicial, correctional and related bodies representing Federal, state, local and tribal agencies.  The Global Advisory Council (GAC) operates under the auspices of the OJP and advises the Federal government, specifically, through the Assistant Attorney General, OJP and the US Attorney General.  The focus of Global is to promote more efficient sharing of data among justice entities by facilitating standards-based electronic information exchange throughout the justice and public safety communities.  The broad scope of the effort is fundamental and crucial to its success.  The Global Executive Steering Committee (GESC) provides leadership for the GAC.  Global aids its member organizations and the people they serve through a series of initiatives, including facilitating Global working groups, developing technology standards such as the Global Justice XML Data Model (GJXDM), creating white papers on data sharing issues such as the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan, and disseminating information via Global-related Web sites.  The work of Global and the GAC is primarily carried out in Working Groups.  There are currently four Working Groups, which may at times be supported by subcommittees.  Work products of these groups are submitted for consideration and approval by the GAC in its advisory role.  The Criminal Intelligence Coordinating Council (CICC) was established in support of the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan.  The CICC will initially act as another subcommittee or Working Group under the auspices of the GAC.  Additional information about Global may be found on the Web at:  http://it.ojp.gov.  OJP requests information from potential offerors as to their capabilities of providing management support to Global and the Designated Federal Official (DFO) including, but not limited to (1) Logistical support:  coordinate site and facility selection, schedule, and announce meetings; provide on-site meeting management; facilitate coordination of public relations needs; provide post-meeting support, including coordinating reimbursement of travel expenses for attendees; assist in coordinating conference calls and other meeting support; ensure notices of GAC meetings, in coordination with DFO, are published in the Federal Register.  (2) Meeting support:  assist in identifying, readying and distributing preparatory documents, meeting materials and presentations as directed by OJP or Global leaders; provide policy research and support to facilitate group discussions as directed by OJP; attend meetings related to GAC, GESC, working groups, subcommittees, and special projects/events; attend annual meetings, coordinated and facilitated as previously stated, as a minimum, two meetings of the GAC and five meetings of the GESC; attend Global Working Group and subcommittee meetings as required by the DFO and GAC Chair, with planning to arrange and provide reimbursements for at least 35 meetings per year with an average attendance of 25 people; coordinate attendance of Global members and/or support staff to at least six conferences and meetings that promote justice information sharing via Global; attend at least six justice integration meetings and conferences to conduct outreach and promote the work of Global in coordination with OJP.  (3) Prepare reports of the GAC, Working Groups and subcommittees; attend and record proceedings; prepare and distribute minutes of all meetings, special projects and events for Global; prepare and distribute, as directed, reports of activities and meetings of Global; provide authoring, editorial and consultant assistance as requested; assist in the authoring of reports by GAC, GESC, Working Groups, subcommittees and special projects and events (may require contacting and involving Subject Matter Experts as needed for specific reports or tasks); assist in outreach activities as directed by OJP; prepare communications and multimedia products to support the goals of the Global Initiative; research, develop and produce informational and multimedia products as needed to highlight the goals and mission of the Global Initiative and improve understanding of Global goals and activities; produce CDs and other marketing materials rapidly while maintaining ability to incorporate changes quickly; support outreach activities to highlight the goals and objectives of Global; plan, develop and support outreach activities in close coordination with members of the GAC and OJP; develop and provide content for Web sites and support Global-related web site(s); work with the Program Office in accordance with Federal guidelines to provide and maintain content, including reports and event notifications for Global-related Web site areas, including affiliated programs such as the Justice Standards Clearinghouse Program and the GJXDM; ensure compliance with applicable rules, and policies, including Federal accessibility standards; ensure ability to restore all content quickly in the event of production system failure; facilitate coordination of multiple groups providing Web site support (Web site must incorporate feedback and content from a variety of sources, including support staff, Web site designers and maintainers, OJP program officials, GAC and Global officials, GTRI (as part of GJXDM), and others as directed by OJP); work with Web site designers as directed by OJP; coordinate regular timely reviews (may be done by conference call) by appropriate personnel to discuss design, content and direction of the Web site; provide semi-annual reports of activities to OJP.

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM - Natick Contracting Division, in support of the US Army Soldier Systems Center-Natick has a requirement for a new Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) which will replace the helmet known as the Personnel Armor System Ground Troops (PA SGT). The ACH will provide an improved helmet to Soldiers that in addition to providing the Soldier ballistic and impact protection, will be used as a  platform to mount electronics such as communication devices, and Night Vision devices among other items.   As a helmet it will provide standard Helmet, Ground Troops and Parachutists and (PASGT) protection as well as increased 9mm protection. The reduced edge cut of the ACH, although reducing area of coverage, will improve the field of vision and hearing, l eading to better situational awareness over the current helmet. The ACH has five basic components: The helmet shell, the pad suspension system, the retention system (chinstrap/napestrap), helmet cover, and eye strap.  The Government anticipates that this r equirement will be a Full and Open Competitive acquisition, however, the Government reserves the right to change the solicitation procedure. It is anticipated that a final Fedbizopps Announcement and solicitation will be released in December 2004, with pro posals due in January 2005. Firms shall not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposals.  The Government envisions that multiple Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts  will be awarded as a result of the R equest for Proposals (RFP) but reserves the right to award one or none. The Government anticipates a one-year Base Ordering Period, with four, one-year Options. If one contract is awarded, the anticipated minimum requirement is 100 ACHs and a maximum requi rement of  880,000 ACHs and applicable spare parts kits for the entire period of performance. If more than one contract is awarded the yearly requirements will be divided (ratio to de determined) among successful offerors. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL THE TO TAL REQUIREMENT EXCEED MORE THAN 880,000 ACHs.  Offerors are to note that Federal Prison Industries (FPI) also known as UNICOR, is currently the mandatory source for helmets. Currently, UNICOR does not have a helmet that meets the ACH requirements. However , at some time UNICOR may develop a helmet that meets the ACH requirements. If the Contracting Officer makes a determination in the future that UNICOR helmets meets the Governments needs in terms of quality, price and time of delivery, UNICOR may be eligi ble to receive a portion of the aforementioned requirement.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VISN 3 Centralized Acquisition Service, intends to negotiate sole source procurement with Lumenis. This proposed contract action is for maintenance and repair of a Coherent Medical Aura Yag Laser located in the Ophthalmology Clinic at Northport VAMC for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 603.2. The VA believes that Lumenis is the only company that can provide, critical maintenance and repair parts for this equipment. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone or e-mail requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements for maintenance and repair of this Coherent Medical Aura Yag Laser. Information may be sent to Josephine Tuitt, Contract Specialist, VA Medical Center, 130 W. Kingsbridge Road, Bronx, NY 10468. Written responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Lumenis. Award period will be 11/22/04-9/30/05 with four (4) option years renewal.

<DESC>This announcement is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  This Request for Information (RFI) is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses to the RFI will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) is conducting market research to determine the feasibility of a set-aside competition for the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) in Washington, DC.  

The Contractor shall provide to the residents of the Armed Forces Retirement Home – Washington, DC (AFRH–W) medical care and ancillary services required to abide by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation on Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards and AFRH-W policies and operational instructions.  The Contractor shall serve as a Physician in the care of a geriatric population in both Inpatient and Ambulatory Care.  

The critical element of this contract is the ability of the Contractor to provide third party billing services and accept their reimbursement as payment in full.  Details are listed below:

RESIDENTS’ Insurance and Billing  
AFRH-W residents have Medicare, TRICARE FOR LIFE or TRICARE PRIME and some have supplemental medical insurance.  At the present time, TRICARE requires that services be requested through the Primary Care Physician in order for TRICARE to be billed for services.  

The Contractor shall submit bills in accordance with procedures prescribed by the TRICARE Operations Manual.  Contractor physicians shall bill TRICARE for only those services that are a covered benefit and shall accept the negotiated reimbursement rate for the services rendered.  

The Contractor is responsible for obtaining insurance information and Informed Consent from the residents.  Insurance information and Informed Consent will be provided to the Contractor by the residents of the AFRH-W at the time services are rendered.  The Contractor shall ensure the residents fully understand that their private insurance will be billed for services.  In the case of a resident who does not have coverage,  the AFRH-W will pay for services at the Tricare rate of reimbursement.       

THIRD PARTY BILLING
	The Contractor shall bill the residents’ insurance company directly for reimbursement of physician services.    Residents and/or their insurance companies will be responsible for payment of all services including co-payments.  The Government is not responsible for payment, and the Contractor shall not bill the Government for these services.  The Government will pay for co-payments for those residents who do not have insurance or are unable to obtain insurance.   The Government will pay the contractor for services at the TRICARE rate of reimbursement for residents without insurance. 	

Other requirements are as follows:
Contractor physicians shall have the following medical qualifications:  
A minimum of an M.D. degree from a nationally accredited college or university covering such degree.    A current, unrestricted license to practice medicine in Washington, DC.  The Contractor shall obtain privileges at one or more local community hospital.  Experience working with a geriatric population and the Wellness Model.  Effective oral and written communication skills in the English language.     Contractor physicians shall possess a current Federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) registration.    

Contractor physicians shall have a special clearance background check performed which will then enable them to use Walter Reed Army Medical Center Composite Health Care System (CHCS) computer system to input medication orders and gather medication profiles on residents; utilize other services directly, and potentially enter laboratory requests.  

The Government shall furnish all expendable/consumable medical supplies (e.g. bandages, disposable items, laboratory supplies, etc.) necessary for the treatment of residents’ medical conditions.   

HOURS OF OPERATION - Normal Service Hours are 7:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. 
The Contractor shall operate the Ambulatory Care Outpatient Clinic for a minimum of 30 hours per week and shall also provide a minimum of 10 hours per week for rounds and reviews in the in-patient areas. The Contractor shall also meet required time lines related to JCAHO regulations.   
The Contractor shall be available to provide services Monday through Friday, pursuant to mutually agreed schedules.  Services will not normally be required on holidays, unless dictated by emergency.  The Contractor shall provide backup coverage for the absences of all regularly scheduled Contractor employees.  

	The Contractor shall provide on-call consultation services, after hours (24 hours per 
day/7 days per week), related to the health and safety of residents.  This service shall be 
provided by the same physicians group that provides the clinics.

<DESC>Dover Air Force Base, Delaware is looking for sources to provide the following: 

Repair and refurbish a empennage platform (hereinafter referred to as the tail stand) designed to service the tail components of C-5A aircraft (See attached).  The tail stand shall be brought to fully functional condition, upgraded and modified.  The tail stand is a 70-ton (approximate), 70-foot tall, self-propelled lattice structure comprised of square tubing weldments.  The main structural members are four leg columns joined by bolting to structural fixed deck supports.  The structure is arranged to envelop the tail of the aircraft and provide six work levels, all connected by stairs and serviced by a 1000-pound capacity elevator.  The sixth work level provides access to the horizontal stabilizer.  Each work level consists of a fixed deck that houses a set of sliding deck panels that are manually pulled out to close the gap between the edge of the fixed deck and the vertical stabilizer.  The stand is also equipped with a 1000-pound capacity jib crane, a 1000-pound capacity traveling hoist on an I-beam, and four stabilizing jacks. The tail stand is supported by four two-wheel axles: two fixed axles are powered by a hydrostatic drive, and two steered axles are un-powered.  A 107 HP, 2800-RPM gasoline engine provides the power to drive and steer the stand at 2 mph in still air and at a slower speed against 40 mph wind. The nominal working pressure of the hydraulic system is 2000 psi.  When in position around the tail, the elevator, jib crane, and the hoist are powered through an electric cable from the hangar power source.    

Please indicate if your business is considered small or large based on NAICS 332312.

<SOLNBR>W91QUZ-05-R-ETSS
<RESPDATE>121504
<ARCHDATE>02132005
<CONTACT>John Norway, 703 325-3332
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit industry feedback on how to structure, fund, and manage an Enterprise Technical Support Services (ETSS) contract vehicle for Microsoft products supporting the Army business and warfighter user  while in garrison, or while deploying or deployed. This ETSS (Microsoft) will mainly provide break/fix and integration support for Microsoft technologies distributed throughout Army. As the Army continues to transform and manage the infostructure at an en terprise level, it seeks to evaluate how it provides technical support for Microsoft products and platforms, and how it can best leverage the Armys economies of scale while preserving the ability to respond to local requirements in a timely and efficient manner. This challenge is exacerbated by the distributed nature of the Army, where users are disbursed throughout the globe under various chains of command, operating in garrison or while deploying or deployed, and by the inherent complexities in providing  centralized or decentralized funding and management for this support. ETSS (MICROSOFT) BACKGROUND:  Army organizations currently have only one enterprise contract vehicle with which to purchase break/fix and integration support services specifically for Microsoft technologies, namely the Microsoft (MS) Premier Support Servic e (PSS) enterprise agreement through the Army Small Computer Program (ASCP).  The MS PSS enterprise agreement offers nine contract line numbers (CLINs) designed to fit most organizations, from large to small.  The agreement is an Indefinite Delivery Indef inite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract directly with MS.  The basic CLIN structure is listed below with varying numbers of hours, incidents, IDs, etc. provided depending on the size and complexity of the organization.  Technical Account Manager (TAM) A dedicated manager that works closely with the organization for X number of hours to understand the systems and business goals (one person eight hours) Alliance support team (AST) Dedicated product engineers- reactive support  Y number of hours for platform issues Z number of hours for messaging issues Named contracts  X number of individuals identified on the Army side to open up an incident or engage contract resources  Support incidents Only X incidents per year to call 24/7  Group web IDs X number of IDs to access to the online resources that are covered on the Non Disclosure Agreements (NDA) Group services desk IDs X number of desk IDs that grants access to the service desk and allow opening an incident  (NOTE:  there are only Y incidents allowed) TechNet single server (12 months subscription) X number of separate mailing address to where the TechNet CDs are mailed.  Put the CDs on server and everybody can have access to TechNet.  TechNet is for personnel managing systems. Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) universal subscriptions X number of mailing of monthly CDs with binder and library materials.  A developer tool designed for application developer such as web portal or custom application. TAM on-site visits X number of site visits (typically up to two days inclusive of all labor and travel) Army organizations can also implement local contracts with other vendors if this enterprise MS PSS vehicle does not meet the organizations requirements, from either a service or cost perspective. However, from an enterprise perspective, the Army believes this current situation does not optimize the effectiveness or efficiency in providing Microsoft product-related technical support services. The following are some of the reasons that advocate a review of the current way technical support services are struc tured, funded, and managed for Microsoft technologies in the Army:   Each Army organization purchases its own technical support services for Microsoft technologies on an as-needed basis, even under the current MS PSS enterprise agreement. By operating in this isolated manner, organizations are not able to easily share solutions to common problems. In addition, this isolation prevents the Army from leveraging its size to increase its buying power to meet support requirements outsi de the MS PSS vehicle. Army organization(s) may acquire technical support services that parallel or conflict with efforts of other Army organization(s) or with the overall strategic information technology (IT) objectives of the Army. The Army at each management level lacks understanding, tracking, and control on how much money is being spent on technical support services for Microsoft technologies Army organizations in the same command may purchase technical support services for the same Microsoft product-related problem, resulting in the Army paying twice for the same service.   As the Army moves towards a single Directorate of Information Management (DOIM) operation and centralizes administration for IT common-user services, support services should be rewarded for economics and effectiveness as an underpinning contract. There are other, non-Microsoft industry sources (such as training academies, integrators, and other IT activities) for Microsoft product-related technical support that may provide qualified technical support via highly-trained engineers. These sources may also provide other value added services. Current technical support services are funded on an ad-hoc basis rather than on a program basis. This ad-hoc nature of funding prevents these technical services from effectively supporting enterprise priorities. With your input, the Armys objective is to review and perhaps modify its current strategy for providing technical service support for Microsoft technologies to the entire Army. This includes understanding how best to fund and manage this enterprise suppor t, as many of the problems listed above are inherent to a decentralized funding and management strategy. However, the Army also has concerns that more centralized procurement will cause the rapid and early depletion of centrally funded services, and that m ore centralized management may not be flexible or responsive to local requirements. Therefore, feedback to the structure, funding, and management of this support is needed if the Army is to meet its imperatives to enhance the security, capabilities and res ource efficiencies of the Army IT enterprise environment.   SCOPE: ETSS (Microsoft) will be primarily focused on providing break/fix (Tier 1-3 and beyond) and integration support for Microsoft technology in garrison, in deployment, and while deployed. ETSS (MICROSOFT) OBJECTIVES: The following are the Armys objectives in investigating a new ETSS (Microsoft) model: 1.	Take advantage of the Armys economies of scale, and ensure that solutions to common problems are leveraged across the enterprise 2.	Fund this support in a manner that minimizes the problems inherent with both centralized and decentralized resource and management strategies 3.	Provide services in accordance with the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practices framework that are flexible, responsive, and can be tailored to the needs of any Army organization at any level 4.	Support the overall strategic IT initiatives of the Army: a.	Protection of the Army Enterprise Infostructure b.	Consolidation of common-user IT services (email, information assurance, web, storage, directory etc.) on Army installations into a Single DOIM  c.	Tailoring of technical support to more modular brigade combat teams (BCTs) in the operational forces 5.	Continue to have access to MS PSS expertise when needed 6.	Enable on call technical support that can be provided 24x7 to anyone, anywhere as dictated by mission requirements QUESTIONS:  The government is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider its development of an ETSS (Microsoft) RFP: 1.	How would you satisfy the above objecti ves and how would you solve the Armys challenge in providing Tier 1-3 and beyond break/fix and integration support for Microsoft technology across its enterprise? Assuming there is a single DOIM in place at every Army installation? Assuming there is not a  single DOIM in place at every Army installation? 2.	How should a large, distributed organization with many diverse and separate sub-organizations structure, fund, manage and execute an enterprise technical support solution for Microsoft technologies, of which MS PSS is an integral part? How do large, dis tributed commercial organizations structure, fund, manage, and execute their own internal enterprise technical support solutions for integration support and Tier 1-3 and beyond break/fix support? 3.	What type of contract vehicle would work best? How should it be structured? How would this vehicle integrate with MS PSS and local unique vendors? How would you recommend handling the legacy/existing contracts in place (including the current MS PSS ente rprise agreement) across the Army for Microsoft technology from a funding, execution, and management perspective? How should local support be established, coordinated and funded while meeting the Army objectives? Through DOIMs, regions, Major Army Commands  (MACOMs), Brigade Combat Teams, higher tactical echelons, CIO/G6, etc.? 4.	How would information on break/fix and integration support problems and resulting solutions be distributed throughout the enterprise? What management reports or metrics should be used, and which ones do you offer? (i.e. cost tracking, problem pattern an alysis, customer satisfaction, resolution times, etc.). How would you suggest making these reports or metrics available across the Army enterprise? 5.	How would you suggest measuring your performance to determine if that performance meets the provision of the contract while supporting future competition? 6.	How would you provide technical service support to the deployed Army (e.g. technical assistance deployed with the unit, deployable support from the Continental United States, pre-positioned support in Theater, etc.)? When this technical support relies o n connectivity, how would you provide this support in a bandwidth constrained environment? 7.	How would you ensure that the technical solutions provided support the Army enterprise vision (i.e. modular restructuring in the operational forces, Active Directory architecture, etc.)? What information or documentation would you require from the gover nment to ensure this? 8.	What types of services included under break/fix and integration support (i.e. incident management, problem escalation, disaster recovery, remote resolution, planning and design, etc.) are best provided by MS PSS, and which can best be provided by other vendors? 9.	What training and education could be included in an ETSS (Microsoft)?  For example, Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) training, and educational support?  10.	How would you integrate or incorporate the use or potential use of MS PSS for these services? How would the MS PSS support be structured in this enterprise concept? 11.	What other services and added value solutions do you propose? For example, support to other software products on Microsoft platforms and other non-Microsoft platforms such as LINUX and UNIX.   Your ideas and input in answering the above information will greatly assist us in creating the most appropriate and relevant RFP for ETSS (Microsoft). SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI will be in the form of a White Paper, not to exceed twenty (20) pages, and supported by a Microsoft Power Point briefing, including notes, not to exceed fifteen (15) slides.  Submit Responses, via e-mail, to M s. Patricia Whitenton at patricia.whitenton@us.army.mil no later than close of business on December 15, 2004.

This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Contract by Negotiation Procedures as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.

This is not a solicitation, but a notification of our intent to modify an existing contract.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

<SUBJECT>A -- Tools to Identify an Enemy's Command Organization and Manage its Disruption
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested sources by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Exploitation Office (IXO) regarding the ability of firms to conduct research in the area of tools to identify an enemy’s command organization, estimate its performance, and manage its disruption.

DARPA is exploring the availability of computational techniques relevant to the identification and disruption of decision-making processes in enemy command organizations. To this end, DARPA invites brief white papers. Upon review of the white papers, DARPA will select a limited subset of papers that are judged as particularly relevant to DARPA's interests. The authors of the selected papers will be invited to discuss their concepts at a workshop to be held in late January 2005, location to be announced later.  Attendance at the workshop is by invitation only. The workshop will be UNCLASSIFIED. DARPA is interested in white papers even if the authors are unable to attend the workshop.

The motivation for this topic is the US military’s growing emphasis on Information Warfare. Understanding and affecting the human decision-making processes within an enemy command organization is a key aspect of Information Warfare [1]. This RFI focuses specifically on managing the efforts to degrade the timeliness and quality of the decisions produced by an enemy command organization. 

A command organization consists of individuals and sub-organizations at different levels of responsibility, linked by a variety of relations and procedures, both hierarchical and peer-to-peer, both formal and informal. Organizations of interest range from the more structured command systems of a conventional military to the less structured and fluid leadership of guerillas and other irregular combatant forces. The enemy command organization's structure and processes are often little known to the friendly forces, and difficult to observe. Such organizations evolve and change rapidly, especially during a military operation, due in part to physical attrition as well as to other factors. 

The flows and interactions of decisions and information in such a dynamic system can cause a range of complex phenomena. Thus, by applying a proper set of dynamic, time-dependent impacts (either physical or informational) on elements and connections of the enemy command organization, it may be possible to induce delays and errors in the enemy decision-making processes that are advantageous to the friendly forces, at the right place and time. Tentative illustrations of some such effects are in discussed at references 1 through 5 at the end of this announcement. 

Within this overall capability, consider the following four sub-problems. DARPA is interested in computational techniques and tools that would assist the US armed forces to solve these problems in real-time, during the conduct of military operations.   

1. Identify the enemy command organization. By exploiting limited, sparse observables, such as observations of enemy movements, attacks, communications (often non-electronic and/or encoded) between some of the command nodes, determine the most likely topology, characteristics, relations and decision-making processes of the enemy command organization. Account for rapid adaptations and changes (often on a scale of hours and even minutes) that are likely to be occurring in that organization and processes.  

2. Plan a coordinated course of actions against the enemy command organization. Given the available (usually constrained) means of physical and informational impacts on the enemy command, devise an effective combination and sequence of actions. Provide for probing. Leverage dynamic system effects. Account for significant uncertainty in the friendly knowledge of the enemy command organization, as well as its time-dependency and adaptability. 

3. Predict the impact of the planned actions. Given the knowledge of the enemy command organization (such as obtained in the identification process, above) and the proposed friendly course of action, determine the likely impact these actions would have on the enemy command decision-making, particularly on its timeliness and accuracy. Time and effort involved in such modeling and prediction should be consistent with its use in real-time. Address the issue of validating a predictive model with respect to the real world.

4. Control the unfolding execution of the selected course of action. In real-time, exploit the available observables (generally sparse and partially inaccurate), assess the state of the unfolding operation and suggest corrective adjustments.

In the event a white paper is favorably considered, the offeror will be invited to submit a complete proposal, within 30 calendar days of notification by the Contracti ng Officer.  Such notification will confirm that the offeror's white paper addresses an area of interest and the offeror has a reasonable chance for an award based on subsequent evaluation of the offeror's full proposal.  There will be no debriefings of wh ite papers. Proposals not meeting the described format may not be reviewed.  White papers not favorably considered will not be returned but will remain the BAA file. White papers and proposals will be selected based on the availability of funding and the e valuation procedures outlined.   EVALUATION CRITERIA/PROCEDURES:  White papers and proposals will be selected  through a formal procedure encompassing a technical/scientific and REF decision review process.  Proposers are advised that white papers and proposals may be reviewed or evaluated by non-government personnel such as consultants, each of whom will have acce pted the terms and conditions of a non-disclosure agreement and an Organizational Conflict of Interest statement. All reviewed and evaluated white papers and proposals may not be funded due to budgetary or program constraints.  White papers and proposals w ill be evaluated using the Attachment 2 Color Rating System at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/docpage/pages/sol_stat.htm with respect to the following factors: (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the REF program, to include maturity and level o f risk; To receive a BLUE rating the application must be in at least prototype phase of production with a low to moderate risk. (2) the scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application. To receive a BLUE rating the app lication must be new technology utilizing new and innovative approach. (3) the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities. In order to receive a Blue rating, the offeror must demonstrate competence and at least two years experience. (4) es timated cost effectiveness (the ROCM).  To achieve a Blue rating the offeror must demonstrate the ability to prepare and submit a cost proposal to enable accurate evaluation and understanding of the proposed cost by the Government. Factors 1, 2, and 3 are weighted equally, the forth and least important factor is cost. Offerors are reminded significant differences in measured merit may or may not be deemed affordable depending upon the best interests of the Government.  White papers related to the developmen t of a specific system will be considered as non-responsive.  Evaluations may take up to one month from receipt of White Paper to complete.   OFFEROR INFORMATION:  Numerous awards may result from this BAA and will depend upon the quality and merit of white papers and proposals received and available funding. If the Government decides to pursue a concept with regard to this BAA a formal proposal will be requested.   Award of any contracts are anticipated to occur in FY 2005.  If selected, you must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov/) in order to receive the award.    If you are not in the CCR at the time  we are ready to make the award, you will be disqualified. Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to fund any white paper, pay any proposal preparation costs, or to award any contract.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Gover nment's needs may submit a white paper, which will be considered. No portion of this announcement is set aside for historically black colleges and universities (HBCU's) or minority institutions (MI's); proposals are invited from all sources. The Government  reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the white papers or proposals received in response to this announcement.

<SUBJECT>C -- Design Services for National Biodefense Analysis & Countermeasure Center
<SOLNBR>HSFLR040038
<RESPDATE>010505
<CONTACT>Robert Driggers, Contracting Officer, Phone 912-261-3630, Fax 912-280-5343, Email bob.driggers@dhs.gov - Danny Hager, Chief, Construction Contracts Branch, Phone 912-267-3290, Fax 912-280-5343, Email danny.hager@dhs.gov
<DESC>Architect-Engineering Services (A&E Services) are required for the design of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) Facility proposed for Fort Detrick, Frederick, Maryland.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified the need to establish modern secure biocontainment facilities and provide technologies, products and capabilities to support DHS in fulfilling its responsibilities with respect to terrorist attack and major disasters involving biological threat agents (BTA).  The NBACC facility will be located on the National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC) at Fort Detrick, MD and will serve to establish an enduring national capability to anticipate, prevent, respond to, and recover from bioterrorist attack.  The NBACC project will establish a facility comprised of biocontainment laboratories at the BSL (biosafety) 2, 3, & 4 levels with the capability to conduct testing of aerosolized high hazard threat agents against animals, bench research on threat agents, and bioforensics analysis.  The proposed 160,000 square foot building, which will be a stand-alone facility in terms of utilities, will provide a full-scale operational bioforensics capability and a smaller, but still significant, capability to perform threat characterization research of biothreat agents.  The total estimated cost of this project, including design and construction, is $121,166,000.  Since the U. S. is lacking in such critical national capability, acquiring an operational facility as soon as possible is of high priority.  This procurement is unrestricted.  The purpose of this procurement is to select a highly qualified A&E Services firm with demonstrated experience in the design of level 2, 3, & 4 laboratories and vivarium and associated support spaces, or similar facilities.  This contract will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6.  The A&E Services firm will be selected in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in this synopsis, the evaluation criteria in FAR Section 36.602-1, through review of Standard Form (SF) 330’s and subsequent interviews.  The top ranked A&E Services firm will be sent a Request for Proposal based on demonstrated competence and the unique qualifications for the required work.  After receipt of the firm’s proposal, negotiations will proceed.  A single firm-fixed price contract will be negotiated and awarded.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  The plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.  Two contracts will ultimately be awarded: one to the A&E Services firm selected as a result of this notice; the other to a construction firm.  The Government intends to utilize a Construction Manager at Risk or Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Contract procedure for this requirement.   Under this concept, the CMc functions as a collaborative member of the project team.  The CMc will be responsible for all construction under a single contract and also provides expertise during the design process for the Government by checking estimates and performing constructability reviews.  It is anticipated that award of the CMc contract will follow closely behind the award of the A&E Services contract so that the CMc can provide the preconstruction services during the design phase.  At a pre-determined point in the design phase (likely between 50% and 70% design), the CMc offers a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and construction of the project will begin, before design completion.  Actual construction is estimated to commence 8-14 months after design begins and be completed within approximately 22 months.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  In addition to the evaluation criteria in FAR Section 36.602-1, the following criteria will be used in the selection of the A-E firm:  (1)   Firms will be evaluated in terms of the firm’s relevant experience, including relevant experience of staff members, specifically on design work required by this procurement.  Responsive firms will list all projects completed in the last ten years, which are of similar nature and scope as described herein, particularly the firm’s ability/past experience in working with CMc’s and the Guaranteed Maximum Price process.  The list shall include project name, project location, project scope and current contract information.  (2) Responsive firms will provide a list of key personnel, including subcontractors, proposed to work on this contract, and will indicate the percentage of total work the prime contractor expects to complete with its own work force.  (3) Firms shall document each person’s role in preparing construction documents.  (4) Demonstrate knowledge of local codes, laws, permits and construction materials and practices of the geographical location.  (5) Provide information on past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules and current Federal directives for sustainable design.  (6) Demonstrate knowledge of environmental conditions/issues to include wetlands, water tables, flood planes, weather/climate conditions, coastal conditions, ecological concerns, and historically/archeological issues.  (7) provide information on the firm’s quality control program which the firm uses to ensure (a) technical accuracy, (b) discipline coordination, including cross-discipline design checks, (c) ability to monitor time, (d) costs are kept within assigned limits, (e) quality of design, and (f) coordination and oversight of subcontractors/consultants.  No solicitation package is available.  Interested firms having the capabilities for this work are invited to submit original and six (6) copies of SF 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the Contracting Office Address listed above, Attn: Robert E. Driggers, Contracting Officer.  The SF 330 may be expanded, if necessary, to address the selection criteria fully.  A completed SF 330 shall be submitted for each proposed key consultant.  All submittals are due no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time January 5, 2005.  Interested firms are invited to attend a pre-submittal conference/site visit at Fort Detrick, Maryland on December 1, 2004.  The agenda will include an overview of this requirement, a question and answer period, and a tour of the construction site.  Provide names of attendees to the Contracting Officer via e-mail no later than November 23, 2004.  The exact location and time for the conference will be published by amendment to this synopsis.

<DESC>The referenced combined synopsis/solicitation (OPM-RFQ-05-00003AMC)is hereby amended to address questions and answers, and to incorporate the following sections:  Place of Performance, Government-Furnished Facilities and Equipment, Travel, Security, and Section 508 Compliance.  

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q:	No contractor employees shall solicit new business at OPM or its facilities while performing work under this contract.” Can you clarify this statement further?
A:	While working on a contract at OPM or its facilities, neither the contractor nor its employees can solicit or market for any new business.  However, they are welcome to respond to any OPM solicitation.

Q:	 For example, we currently have contracts with OPM both as a prime contractor and as a subcontractor. Would this disqualify us from bidding on this solicitation? What is the rationale for the requirement? Could certain restrictions be put in place to allow current OPM contractors to bid on this?
A:	No, a contractor can have one or more contracts for OPM as long as it doesn’t create an organizational conflict of interest. (OCI) (FAR 9.5).

Q:	Another statement in the solicitation is: “While not required, it is preferable that the contractor have a basic familiarity of federal retirement benefits administration, processes, and systems used to calculate retirement and survivor annuities.”  Why is knowledge of the federal retirement program not required? It would seem that in order to examine the accuracy of retirement annuity payments, knowledge of federal retirement should be a requirement, not just preferred.
A:	We do not feel detailed knowledge of the Retirement Benefits Administration is a prerequisite to successfully provide the services solicited.

Q:	Is the referenced solicitation a small business set-aside?
A:	Yes

Q: 	Is the $6 million annual sales the upper limit for such “small business”?
A:	The $6 million annual sales upper limit is the total dollar amount of sales over three fiscal year period (FAR 19.101 (v) (1)).

Q:	How much data preparation does OPM expect will be necessary for completion of the tasks listed?  In other words, can the contractor expect to work from well structured data to perform the analysis, or should they expect a significant amount of effort to be expended on data extracts and transformations in order to perform the sampling and analysis listed in the required tasks?
