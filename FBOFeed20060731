<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Western Region Acquisition Division (WRAD), is requesting proposals for design/construction of two (2) 35-39 foot advanced composite, light-weight vessels.  One (1) vessel is to conduct research, education, public outreach, and maritime heritage for the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and the other vessel to support research, education and resource protection aimed at increasing the understanding of humpback whales for the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary.  The vessels will be operating year round in and around the coastal regions of the Pacific Ocean. In the areas that are within 30 nautical miles (nm) of land, environmental conditions often include choppy, short-period wind waves (5 to 7 feet) masking larger, long-period swells (7 to 9 feet). These conditions can arise very abruptly and as such, both platforms must be able to tolerate a wide range of weather conditions.  These Response Class Vessels will be staffed with one (1) operator and one (1) qualified crewmember, and a small group of passengers.  The vessels design/construction must allow for ease of operations and low maintenance. The vessels design/construction must include a capability for rapid deployment requiring minimum start-up and underway procedures.  The minimum vessel requirements are as follows:  The vessels design/construction must be between 35 and 39 feet length overall, with a beam less than or equal to 14 feet, minimum draft is preferred; each vessel must have a 300 nm range at cruising speed including limited overnight capabilities; holding tanks for both potable and grey/black water and one head; portable and fixed fire fighting systems must be installed in accordance with CFR Chapter 46, Subchapter T, and NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 217-103: Management of NOAA Small Boats; alternators and inverters to provide full DC for bridge electronics and clean 110 volt AC for laptops, small project-specific electronics, minimal galley equipment, and a hot water heater; both vessels must be able to accommodate 10 persons during day trips, and sleeping accommodations for up to four persons are required; two (2) diesel engines for propulsion, although a preference propellers and rudders, jets should be an option;  vessels must be able to attain transit speeds of 30 knots at 90% engine load and will require the ability to reach short-term “sprint” speeds, for emergency response purposes; maximum “go-no-go” weather criteria will include Small Craft Advisories and/or 25 to 30 knot sustained winds with five- to six-foot wind waves; each vessel must be able to tolerate up to 40 knot winds and seven- to eight-foot wind waves, in case either one is caught in sudden or unexpected weather conditions; vessel design should allow for launch and recovery of a small boat in 16 to 20 knot winds and 4-foot seas; and the vessels’ metacentric height (GM) should be calculated such that it will optimize the roll period, to prevent the vessels from being either too stiff or too tender.  It is anticipated that one or more firm-fixed price contract(s) will be awarded.  Performance period is estimated at 12 months.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-aside. See Numbered Note 1.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 336612 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Estimated cost is between $1 and 5 Million.  All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and may register at the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. Documents for the Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about August 15, 2006, to download through the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Specific vessel requirements will be posted with the solicitation.   No paper copies will be issued. Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps [REGISTER AS AN INTERESTED VENDOR] and also the [REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION] feature which provides notification when the RFP becomes available for download and all postings associated with the solicitation, thereafter.  Each potential offeror is responsible for checking this website to gain all the current information available.

Technical questions regarding this solicitation should be addressed to judi.m.jzyk@noaa.gov.  All responsible, responsive sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency.  Please note that this solicitation requires that a 20% bid guarantee be submitted with the proposal submission and that a performance and payment bond will be required at 100% of the award amount approximately seven (7) calendar days after award.

<DESC>The Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) requires an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity contract to acquire a self-recovering system which will eliminate the environmental impact of leaving behind an expendable anchor weight and to eliminate the need to carry onboard thousands of kilograms of expendable anchor weights that would otherwise be required for a 30-60 day research cruise to remote ocean areas.

The Variable Buoyancy Device (VBD) will be attached to the top of an instrument package. The instrument package will be suspended above an anchor weight by 1-30 m of line. The instrument package needs to be suspended above the sea floor. The height above the sea floor will vary depending on the application and will be adjusted by changing the length of line between the anchor and instrument package. The typical distance that the instrument package is above the sea floor is 2 meters.

An acoustic signal sent to the VBD should initiate a sequence of events that causes the VBD, Instrument Package, and Anchor to float to the surface for recovery.

Two common operational scenarios are envisioned for the equipment. In the first scenario, the equipment will be deployed and recovered multiple times per day in water depths from 100-350 m using research vessels or chartered fishing vessels. Thirty to 120 minutes after deployment, the equipment will be recovered on the surface. The user will need to quickly ready the instrument package and VBD for the next deployment. All steps required to ready the system for another deployment (including any re-programming of the controller and/or replacement/recharging of compressed air cylinders) will typically take place on the exposed deck of a ship or small boat in an environment of high humidity, tropical air temperatures (~32 ºC), direct sunlight, salt spray, wave wash, and/or rain. In the second scenario, the equipment will be deployed in the late afternoon in water depths from 100-350 m. Up to 72 hours later, a 6 meter boat or similar will be used to activate the recovery sequence, locate the device when it surfaces, and tow it to a larger vessel for retrieval using a shipboard crane.

Recovery and redeployment operations may occur in rough conditions and in environments exposed to wave wash, sea spray, rain, tropical temperatures, and extreme humidity. Setup, deployment, and recovery of the equipment should be simple and straight-forward. Any opportunities for user error should be minimized. Any consumables or tools required to re-deploy the VBD should be minimized.

It is anticipated that the equipment will be deployed up to 8 times per day, 175 days per year. When the units are not being used they may be stored on deck or in shipping containers. The shipping containers are not air conditioned and will be located at sites such as Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, and Saipan and will be subject to tropical temperatures and humidity.

The Variable Buoyancy Device, related procedures, and appurtenances that contribute the most to improved operational efficiencies, safety, and data return rate of fisheries and benthic habitat survey efforts are considered superior.


This procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Business concerns.  The current NAICS code is 334112 with a size standard 1,000 employees.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the  U.S. Department of Energy(DOE)/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is planning to issue a sole-source contract to enable the NNSA to obtain assistance from the Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc,  801 South Illinois Ave, Oak Ridge TN, 37831-0895 for a Firm Fixed Price contract. The Neutron Detectors to be delivered within 24 months after award NAICS code is 334516, standard size 500. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) requires "portable high-purity germanium detectors for indent response and radiation detection applications."  The NNSA intends to fulfill this requirement and obtain Neutron/Gamma Identifications Kits for the Office of Emergency Operations, NA-40 to enhance its Emergency response capability. The Neutron/Gamma Identifications Kits(N/G  ID Kit) include a fission meter, which allows the characterization of neutron emitting sources, an immeasurable value added benefit for neutron source characterization by NA-40 First Responders. a.    Item: 42- Portable mechanically cooled high-purity germanium detector including AC/DC power adapter/charger, car charger, shoulder strap; optional battery belt or battery power source, adequate protective software and cabling and electronics to swiftly upload results of survey to computer.  b.   Item: 6- Fission meter for neutron source characterization to identify direction and strength of neutron radioisotope (Neutron) sources.         Fission meters are nearly half comprised of 3He (Helium-3), a very expensive commodity.         Fission meters are not a commercially available item, thus further complicating cost estimating.         The Characteristics of the Neutron/Gamma Identification Kit include: Superior accuracy and sensitivity to both Neutron and Gamma sources (equal to        greater than 40% sensitivity for Gamma detection)         Operating controls and protective covers and shipping containers         Handling ands portability capable of operation on battery         Mechanically cooled (not liquid Nitrogen-cooled)         Industry grade warranty         Neutron detectors able to perform timing measurements to distinguish cosmic         rays produced and fission source produced neutrons.

<DESC>This is a synopsis of a proposed contract action in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2.  This Research and Develop (R&D) requirement is to study the Condition Based Maintenance (CBM+) process, provide an implementation roadmap for a CBM+ program meeting full DoD and Air Force policy requirements and to develop prototype maintenance data collection and flight data collection systems for United States Air Force (USAF) C-130 aircraft.   

The estimated issue date for the solicitation to www.FedBizOpps.gov will be 16 August 2006 with an estimated response date by 30 September 2006 (or 45 days after actual RFP post date).  The estimated award date is 17 October 2006.  Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. 

A sole source award is contemplated to The Corporation of Mercer University, Mercer Engineering Research Center (MERC), 135 Osigian Blvd., Warner Robins, GA 31088-7810 (CAGE 0AC45).  The applicable authority and justification is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (the supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  Per FAR 6.302.1(a)(ii), services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency’s requirements if other than sole source contracting methods were used.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  All potential offerors should contact the Contracting Officer  identified below for additional information or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition.  

The proposed action is for a five-year Indefinite Delivery – Indefinite Quantity contract.  The basic period of performance will be for one-year and there will be four one-year options.

The NAICS code is 541618.  This acquisition will be acquired using Simplified Acquisition procedures. TITLE:  Dietary Supplement Safety Evaluation:  Product Consistency and Adverse Events Project. BACKGROUND: The mission of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to assure the safety and wholesomeness of the nation’s food supply, including dietary supplements in accordance with the regulations established by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.  Among CFSAN’s priority activities in supporting this mission is performing post market surveillance of adverse events and using other information from academic or regulatory bodies to detect signals of possible safety concerns associated with the use of dietary supplements.   In November 2004 FDA announced a “Regulatory Strategy for the Further Implementation and Enforcement of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994”.  Included in this announcement were several specific initiatives, including: (1) plans to improve the evidentiary base for safety and enforcement decision making through external collaborations and internal resource priority-setting.  (2) FDA’s intention to implement a transparent and systematic process for evaluating safety concerns about dietary ingredients and dietary supplements.  To assist FDA in its efforts to identify the safety issues affecting dietary supplement use, FDA is announcing this research proposal to identify variations in the level of stimulant-like ingredients associated with dietary supplement adverse event reports that are relevant to the safety of dietary supplement products.  OBJECTIVE:	  To link with an existing adverse event reporting system capable of identifying adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplement products claiming stimulant or sympathomimetic properties and to sample these products for variation in the level of ingredients that may contribute to the reported adverse events.   Critical to the successful implementation of this project will be the linkage with medical toxicologists trained in the investigation, assessment and testing for the causality of exposures.  The purpose of utilizing expertise in medical toxicology in investigation and follow up (appropriate case review, analysis of products, and clinical testing) is to provide the best available science to support the regulatory process.  Furthermore, identification of specific examples where product variation of ingredient content may have contributed to the reported adverse event and its seriousness may provide beneficial information to consumers and in the implementation of regulatory guidelines or requirements that improve product safety and consistency.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The Contractor shall link with a dietary supplement health effects surveillance program for investigating reports of adverse health events in individuals using dietary supplements.  This program will operate independently in a consistent and transparent manner to identify adverse events associated with products making stimulant or sympathomimetic claims, obtain product for sampling, and test for variation in the level of combination of ingredients with stimulant or sympathomimetic properties that may have contributed to the adverse event or its seriousness.  The goal is to apply a consistent, objective approach and validated testing method to identify variation in ingredient quantity or combination that may contribute to the incidence of adverse events reported for dietary supplements making stimulant or sympathomimetic claims.   The proposal meeting this need will: REQUIREMENTS:  (1) Utilize an existing adverse effect reporting system(s) (i.e. Poison Control System, Hospital Emergency Call Center) that monitor calls involving dietary supplements and collect cases that involve symptoms for prompt follow-up and investigation.  (2)  Identify adverse events reported for products with claims associated with stimulant of sympathomimetic properties (i.e. weight loss, performance enhancing).  (3) Utilize medical toxicology expertise to assess the strength of association between reported exposure to dietary supplement products and the reported events, including expertise in:  A. Mechanisms of toxicity : (1) Biochemistry, (2) Pathophysiology, (3) Pharmacology, (4) Toxicokinetics, (5) Adverse Drug Events/Drug interactions, (6) Teratogens/carcinogens; B. Analytical Toxicology Laboratory; C. Forensic toxicology; D. Statistics. 
1.	Carry out comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigation of reported events to obtain reliable and accurate data in a timely manner, including product analysis and biological fluid testing by a reliable and reproducible laboratory system.
2.	Work in conjunction with the Project Officer to publish novel findings of dietary supplement related illnesses.  Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1.	Identify reported adverse events associated with dietary supplement products marketed with stimulant claims and labeled with stimulant or sympathomimetic ingredients.
2.	Obtain samples of the product, including the actual lot or package when possible, for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the ingredients of concern.
3.	Report to the project officer the testing findings and relationship of these findings to the incidence and type of adverse events reported for these types of products.  

The monitoring and testing program shall include: 1. Demonstration of the process for receiving, collecting and reviewing adverse event information and identification of the products of interest. 2. Establishment of guidelines for the handling, processing and redacted distribution of any privileged information which may be shared with FDA or other parties during the performance of the contract in accordance with Privacy Act requirements; 3. Description and demonstration of the validation methods used in the qualitative and quantitative assessment of product sampling, addressing product and operative consistency and reliability.  INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE: Schedule:  1. Initial meeting to discuss work plan, 2. Regular monthly conferences to review and discuss progress, 3. Final meeting after delivery of the final report to respond to agency questions.  DELIVERIES/PERFORMANCE:  The contractor shall: 1. Provide a final report that: (a) Summarizes all adverse event reports received during the period of work performance.  (b) Summarizes the characteristics of the adverse event reports identified for product testing.  (c) Summarizes the qualitative and quantitative findings of the testing for ingredients in the products that were tested.  (d) Summarizes issues and challenges encountered during the performance of this contract for product testing and validation.  2. Describe the testing and validation methods for quantitative and qualitative assessment.  3.  Provide results for testing and validation of all products and equipment utilized for this projects on request of the Project Officer.  Delivery Instructions for Reports: Unless otherwise specified, all reports or copies of reports shall be delivered to the Project Officer.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to solicit and negotiate a sole-source contract with the Smithsonian Institution, Office of Sponsored Projects, 750 Ninth Street N.W., Washington, DC 20560 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (5) as implemented by FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute.  The most appropriate NAICS Code is 541690 with a small business size standard not to exceed $6,000,000.  The USCG has a requirement for the operation of the National Ballast Information Clearinghouse (NBIC) and support for the USCG Ballast Water Management (BWM) program.  Pursuant to Section 1102(f) of the National Invasive Species Act (NISA) of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-332), the USCG is required to develop and maintain a NBIC in consultation and cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution, acting through the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC).  The Smithsonian Institution has operated the NBIC since 1998 under a reimbursable agreement with the USCG and, since January 1, 2006, a contract.  Under NISA and its implementing regulations (33 CFR 151 Subpart D), each vessel bound for ports or places of the United States, regardless of whether a vessel operated outside the Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ), which includes the equivalent zone of Canada, is required to submit reports of BWM practices directly to the NBIC for entry into a database.  The NBIC shall provide technical support to assist the USCG in collecting, analyzing, and maintaining BWM data from vessels reported pursuant to 16 U.S.C. §4712.  The NBIC shall collect and enter the BWM data into an electronic database and summarize the status of the database and entry rate of reports. Updated electronic copies of the database shall be provided to the USCG quarterly.  The NBIC shall continue the development and maintenance of the Directory of Ballast Water Research, Control, and Treatment Technologies to provide a conduit for access to information by public and private entities.  Updates on the status of the Directory shall be provided to the USCG quarterly.  The NBIC shall assist the USCG in implementing and documenting actions necessary to correct any deficiencies highlighted as a result of the ongoing Certification & Accreditation (C&A) process for the BWM database. The NBIC shall review existing system documentation, pertinent regulations, and statutory provisions to ensure the BWM database adheres to Title III of the E-Government Act (Pub.L. 107-347) and DHS Policy Directive 4300A, Information Technology Security Program.  The NBIC shall assist the USCG in developing recommendations for input into the Risk Management System, including Risk Assessment Recommendations, Contingency Plan Recommendations, Contingency Plan Test Result Recommendations, System Security Plan Recommendations, and Security Assessment Report Recommendations.  The NBIC shall prepare a control matrix or Plan of Action and Milestones identifying the basic strategy and the control techniques implemented to contain threats, address vulnerabilities, and achieve security objectives.  The NBIC shall synthesize and analyze the data from vessels reporting BWM and provide the USCG with reports of the statistical analyses to measure patterns of compliance with ballast water management regulations, ballast water delivery and management patterns, the spatial pattern and rate of coastal marine invasions attributed to ballast water and other transfer mechanisms, and the effectiveness of BWM strategies in reducing the rate and pattern of aquatic biological invasions.  The NBIC shall, not to exceed six per month, undertake special project reports of a more sophisticated nature than the standard analyses, which shall be conducted by NBIC staff with advanced training and experience in database and statistical analyses.  The NBIC shall submit annual reports that summarize database management activities and statistical analyses by geographic location, ship type, and quarterly period.  The period of performance is a four-month base period, four one-year option periods, and an eight-month option period.  Responses may be faxed to 202-475-3905, or may be e-mailed to efeinberg@comdt.uscg.mil.  See Note 22.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.

<SUBJECT>A -- Epidemiology Diabetes Interventions and Complications - Clinical Coordinating Center

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is planning a ten-year continuation of the follow-up study of approximately 1,400 subjects enrolled in the Epidemiology Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC).  Twenty-eight clinical centers have been participating under a contract awarded to Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) by NIDDK in this follow-up study of participants originally studied in a randomized, multi-centered clinical trial called the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).  

The DCCT began in 1982 with twenty-one centers and eight additional sites were added after the first three-year feasibility phase was completed.  The twenty-nine clinical centers were funded by cooperative agreements awarded by NIDDK.  The DCCT studied the effect of intensive blood glucose control on the occurrence of early microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The DCCT completed the intervention study in June 1993, and the main results were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 1993.  At the end of the DCCT, two study sites were combined so that twenty-eight centers continued to follow the DCCT patients.  EDIC, the follow-on study to the DCCT, began in 1993 and was initially funded as a continuation of the DCCT cooperative agreements.

Since 1996 CWRU has performed under contract with NIDDK as the EDIC Clinical Coordinating Center, with one clinical center located on-site at CWRU and the other twenty-seven clinical centers performing under subcontracts with CWRU.  CWRU was chosen under a limited competition with the twenty-eight medical institutions that were the only known sources with access to the subjects who participated in the DCCT.  The institutions are CWRU, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University Medical Center, Henry Ford Hospital, Institute for Research and Education, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mayo Foundation, Medical University of South Carolina, Park Nicollet Medical Foundation, University of Iowa, University of Minnesota, University of Missouri – Columbia, University of Pittsburgh, University of Tennessee, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School	, University of Toronto, University of Washington, University of Western Ontario, Vanderbilt University, Washington University at St. Louis, Yale University, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Northwestern University, University of California, San Diego. University of Maryland at Baltimore, 	University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, University of South Florida, and University of Michigan. 

Under the EDIC, long-term follow-up of this cohort has provided additional important scientific information on late macrovascular complications that were not studied in the DCCT.  The EDIC study group has made the unexpected finding that “metabolic memory” exists for the effect of blood glucose control on the development of complications in patients with type 1 diabetes.  Despite similar levels of blood glucose control during the EDIC study, patients who were in the DCCT intensively treated group have had much slower progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular event markers than the DCCT standard group patients.  This has been documented in multiple peer-reviewed publications (see attachment).  

It is the intention of the Government to negotiate with CWRU a ten-year follow-on contract to perform as the EDIC Clinical Coordinating Center (EDIC CCC).  CWRU has served as the EDIC CCC and has established and managed subcontracts with the other EDIC 27 centers since 1996.  In this role CWRU has developed the experience and expertise to efficiently manage these contracts.  The participants are a closed population so the subcontracts for the extension of EDIC will be with the same 27 institutions which are the only sources with access to the approximately 1,400 EDIC subjects.  None of the other twenty-seven EDIC clinical centers with access to the EDIC participants have the staff, organization, experience, and facilities to perform as the EDIC CCC.
The EDIC CCC is responsible for supervising and monitoring the subcontractors’ performance for the approximately 1,400 patients at the twenty-eight clinical centers.  The EDIC CCC is responsible for supervising the structure and functioning of the EDIC clinics.  This includes monitoring the performance of study personnel, approving the allocation of study FTE, approving changes in clinical center Principal Investigators, providing uniform supplies to the clinics for performance of the subjects’ assessments, supporting the preparation and submission of informed consent documents, and monitoring the performance of subject assessments and data collection.  The subject assessments include obtaining blood specimens for biochemical analysis of renal and metabolic status in central labs, renal function evaluation, ultrasound and electrocardiograph macrovascular assessment, stereo fundus photographs of the retina, carotid ultrasound examinations, and coronary calcification computed tomography scans. The EDIC CCC has developed an interactive relationship with the 27 subcontracting centers.  Subcontracts are issued for the study deliverables and continuously monitored.   The EDIC CCC compiles, completes, and submits all financial reports for the 28 institutions (including itself).  

Authority:  41 USC 253 (c)(1).  See Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a 30kN electro-mechanical material test frame with tension/compression load frame, environmental chamber, specimen gripping fixtures, and test-control software.	Test frame will be used to test material coupon-level specimens of widely varying stiffnesses and elongations. This test machine is required to support the future development of multi-functional material concepts.  Highly accurate material characterization tests are neede to develop validated constitutive models of advanced material systems.  Current material systems of interest include highly flexible conductive materials, shape memory materials (both metallic and polymeric), and nano-reinforced material systems.A copy of the specifications for the test frame with tension/compression load frame, environmental chamber, specimen gripping fixtures, and test-control software is attached to this synopsis. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from MTS, who is the only known responsible source.  MTS manufactures the proposed Insight test frame and  produces the associated TestWorks test control software.  The Insight/TestWorks products are being requested to maintain compatibility with existing electro-mechanical material test systems that are in place in the Materials Research Lab.  Having compatibility of software and hardware will reduce the amount of training and re-training that will be required for the technician workforce tasked with operating the machines.  Procuring the requested system will also allow for common maintenance and calibration practices to be maintained which will allow for reduced sight visits by OEM personnel.  Additionally there exists the potential for savings in operational costs by sharing fixtures between the machines.	Consistency in test machine operation and test profile construction is also a major factor, and having the same TestWorks software will allow for migrating test profiles from one machine to another with minimal effort.  Furthermore, software upgrades can be maintained on a consistent schedule so that both machines are kept current and with equivalent capabilities within their rated load ranges. The sole source authority for this item is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).	The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 10, 2006.    Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with DRS Sustainment Systems Inc. (DRS SSI), St Louis MO for the procurement of updates to software required for replacement of the Radiation Hazard Monitor  (RHM) Probe used on Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) High Power Device Test Subsystems (HPDTS).    Due to the obsolescence of the RHM Probe used on the HPDTS, a replacement probe was identified.  To support this replacement probe, updates to the station software as well as to the HPDTRHM-ST (RHM self-test) and the HPDTIO-ST (input/output self test) are required.  All software will include updates to corresponding software design documents.
 The Government intends to procure the software updates for the replacement RHM probe under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.   DRS SSI is the original developer of the source code for the RHM Probe currently in use.  Source code for current RHM probe must be maintained within the software.  DRS SSI software developers are familiar with the current requirements for operation of the RHM Probe and were involved in identifying the replacement probe. No other source possesses this knowledge base. Procuring the updates from another source would result in duplicative cost to the Government.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.    However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis.     A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received as a result of this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to solicit a proposal, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis (FAR 6.302-1) to Bruker Biospin Corporation for the Avance II 600WB High Performance Digital NMR Spectrometer.  Specifications are:  a. 14.1 Tesla self-shielded 89 mm bore magnet with the 5G (FDA exposure limit) line within 1.1 meters radially of the center of the magnet and 2.2 meters axially of the center of the magnet.
b. The entire system must fit within area of 18’ x 9’ 6” (171 sq. ft) with 12’ 6” ceiling height and require only minor electrical system modifications.
c. Two-receiver channels capable of operation in a frequency range from 5 – 600 MHz.
d. Two transmitter channels capable of operation in a frequency range from 5 – 600 MHz.
e. 40 mm inner diameter gradient system capable of 150 G/cm gradient fields on each X, Y and Z axis with digitally controlled, downloaded and compensated gradient power supplies.
f. Digitally controlled B0 compensation supply integrated into the gradient control apparatus.
g.  Modular radio frequency (RF) coils capable of operating at 600 MHz for the purposes of imaging samples from 15 mm to 30 mm in size.
h. Direct upgrade path to 8 receiver channels using standard console architecture.
i. A state of the art computer workstation to control instrument and perform MRI image and NMR spectral signal processing with pulse sequence code compatibility with current MRI scanners in the Mouse Imaging Facility (Bruker Avance 4.7 T / 40 cm, Bruker Avance 7 T /21 cm, Bruker Avance 7T / 16 cm).
Item to be delivered and installed within 8 months at 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.  The device is needed for the examination of prepared tissues and animals via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at extremely high spatial resolution (on the order of 20 microns isotropic).  The upgrade in main magnetic field from 7T to 14.1 T will increase the throughput of the MR microimager by a factor of 4 for the equivalent resolution.  The upgraded electronics will support multi-channel reception of the NMR signal allowing further acceleration of the image acquisition.  Overall image quality and acquisition speed will be increased substantially by this upgrade by any metric.  The device is required to have software and data compatibility with the existing 3 MRI scanners in the Mouse Imaging Facility.
This state-of-the-art technology upgrade is needed to perform high spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging experiments with accelerated temporal resolution. Due to severe site restrictions the magnetic field cannot extend further than listed in the specifications above. A key requirement is the extent of the five gauss line due to other nearby equipment that will not function properly in a magnetic field above 5 gauss. Bruker Biospin Inc. is the only vendor capable of producing such a high magnetic field (14.1T) with sufficient bore size for required experiments (89 mm diameter bore) and with such a 5 gauss line sufficiently close to the magnet.  A second key feature is that the system must be compatible in terms of operation with the other three existing Bruker MRI scanners located in the NIH Mouse Imaging Facility. This is a shared facility with many inexperienced users.  These users often perform imaging experiments on two or three of the existing MRI scanners.  It is critical that the operation in terms of software, hardware features, and data processing be the same across all the available MRI systems.  

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.     The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

Description

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ?MARKET RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE CAPABILITY TO ASSIST THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (NTIA) WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTER BOX COUPON PROGRAM

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  NTIA is seeking capability information from organizations with the experience, qualifications, solution approaches, and best practices necessary to implement and administer the Digital to Analog Converter Box Coupon Program (the Coupon Program) required by Title III of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.  By this RFI, NOAA/NTIA is seeking information regarding the extent to which the vendor community can provide services and solutions to implement and administer the Coupon Program.  Vendors are asked to comment on NTIA’s proposed project objectives and time frames, corporate capability and approach, proposed products, services and solutions, experience and rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Responses to the RFI cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor will the Government pay for the information solicited or recognize any costs associated with the submission of the RFI.  The purpose of the RFI is to provide an opportunity for industry to comment on this procurement, identify potential problem areas, and obtain alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of any future procurement for these services.  The Government believes industry feedback is important and is receptive to all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  Responses should be received by September 15, 2006.  The requirement is to provide a variety of support activities to NTIA in the implementation of the Coupon Program.  Specific information regarding the Coupon Program is attached in the Draft Statement of Requirements.  This RFI will assist the Government in determining the feasibility of setting aside this acquisition for small or small, disadvantaged business.  Comments are solicited regarding the following items:  1)  Is the consolidated or separated acquisition approach the most effective, efficient and reasonably priced? 2) Are NTIA’s business requirements for the Coupon Program, the approach for implementing and administering the Coupon Program, and the target dates and deadlines for the Coupon Program feasible?  Provide information based on your experience and knowledge of the activities, services and solutions in similar projects.  Also, identify possible risks associated with implementing each component of the Coupon Program and suggest mitigation techniques, especially the mitigation of waste, fraud and abuse. 3) Describe your corporate capability to serve as an end-to-end provider for the Coupon Program or provide your established approach for accomplishing one or more program components as well as your approach to fielding a cohesive team with combined experience needed to deliver the components of the Coupon Program.  4) Identify proposed commercial, off-the-shelf products and solutions that may exist to fulfill all or part of the Coupon Program.  5) Provide information about your approach and experience for implementing projects comparable in nature, size, scope and complexity to the Coupon Program.  6) ROM cost information is to be provided to assist NTIA with preparing a realistic project schedule and budget to support the Coupon Program and eventual acquisitions.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

2,  Scientific Forums

NCBDDD serves as a convener and facilitator to bring many sectors of society together to solve problems related to the mission.  Sectors that NCBDDD routinely interacts with include other government agencies, health care professionals, business/industry, educational professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups interested in specific disease conditions or health topics.  NCBDDD wants to ensure that events/conferences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to achieve purposes that are aligned with its mission.  Scientific Forums on NCBDDD’s topics must involve constituents and scientists who may have  disease conditions and/or disabilities that the Center studies.  This often requires involvement of specialist interpreters (with scientific training) and/or technology aids that are not usual and customary in typical conference logistics contracts. The role of contract holders under this contract is to coordinate the activities surrounding the identification of potential conference/forum attendees and speakers and assisting in the development of topical materials/agendas, etc.

The Conference logistics will not be provided under this contract, but will be provided through vendors holding HHS conference support/event planning Blanket Purchase Agreements.

Support for any given item may range from simply typing and editing recorded, handwritten or draft-type materials to conducting all stages of development, including research, original writing, and design.  Capabilities to produce camera-ready copies and presentation slides of materials will be necessary.

b.	Because some tasks will require the collection of large amounts of information and user-friendly access to that information once collected, some initiatives may require development of small databases.  Both paper (camera-ready) copy and computer diskette files shall be made available for all documents in the format and computer program specified in the task order.  Examples of specific types of materials required by the Government may include meeting minutes and reports, guidance documents, policy reports, manuscripts, and other documents.

4. Services in the Planning and Development of Workshop, Conference and Other Presentations

The Contractor shall provide support services in organizing NCBDDD sponsored meetings, workshops, conferences, and other presentations as specified in individual task orders.

Services may include working with partners and/ or providers to develop curricula and materials, locating and arranging for qualified instructors, coordinating and providing exhibit materials, securing audio visual equipment, securing sign language interpreters and TDDY equipment for hearing impaired attendees; making other necessary accommodation for visually and physically impaired attendees,  etc., when required by the task order.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is one Operational Administration within the US Department of Transportation.  NHTSA is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths occurring on the nation's highways.  As one approach to fulfilling this responsibility, NHTSA analyzes vehicle crashes in an attempt to determine what environmental, human, or mechanical factors may have contributed.  

The purpose of this procurement is to provide NHTSA with the capability to investigate, document and evaluate a variety of vehicle crashes on a short-notice basis.  These crash investigations typically involve school buses, child restraint systems, new or emerging technologies in automatic restraint equipped vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, safety defects, adaptive control equipped vehicles, fires, crashes involving air bag deployment related fatalities and serious injuries and other special interest crashes as they arise.  Under this contract, the contractor shall be responsible for the timely gathering and documenting of data pertaining to these crashes.  The contractor shall also be responsible for the quality control of data submitted to NHTSA¡¦s Electronic Data System (EDS).

Specific objectives are as follows:

The contractor shall document pre-crash, at-crash and post crash circumstances and determine and describe the combination of vehicular, occupant, and environmental conditions associated with the identified crashes;

The contractor shall identify and report on all injuries resulting from the crash and associate each injury to the corresponding vehicle component or other object struck during the collision sequence;

The contractor shall determine and report on school bus crash configurations which produce injuries, the impact speeds involved, the positions of the children in the buses (seated, standing, etc.), and the crashworthiness of the buses involved;

The contractor shall examine and report on vehicles equipped with new or emerging technology in safety equipment to provide the NHTSA with information on the effectiveness of this rapidly changing technology, and; 

As needed, the contractor shall provide input on the effectiveness of the case vehicle¡¦s performance to existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Highway Safety Program Standards (HSPS) and /or any safety related defect.

NHTSA anticipates awarding three (3) contracts for these services in order to support three (3) major geographic regions within the United States (Western, Central, and Eastern.) Current plans state that no one contractor will receive award of more than one contract and that contracts will last at least three (3) years with options to increase the term by an additional two (2) years in one (1) year increments.  Any questions regarding this announcement, and its corresponding Request for Proposal must be submitted to the Primary Point of Contact, S. Peter Shultz at Pete.Shultz@dot.gov by no later than 10 August 2006.

Response:
Publically available information on the EUVS is located in Section 5 of the GOES N Databook at 
http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/goes/text/goes.databookn.html. The government is looking into whether or not further EUVS information can be made available at the current time.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to provide additional information on the TDP  and the Solicitation.  Please note the changes to the solicitation as noted  below. In regard to the TDP: 1)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P7 â€“ Where is the data for this booklet?  Is this GFM?      The operatorâ€™s instruction pamphlet will be provided as GFM. 2)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P8 â€“ Is this leakage test required at the final LAP level or  at the ammo can vendor level?       The leakage test is required at the final LAP level 3)  DWG 932241 â€“ Olin is the only approved source.  We are aware that Olin has been running at capacity for several months filling contractors requirements  for 40mm M781.  What is TACOMâ€™s view on allowing other sources?      The TDP is for informational proposes only.  The round has to meet the  Performance Specification provided in the Solicitation.  Note that currently  Olin is the only .38 Caliber Case vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;  another vendor may be qualified in the future.   4)DWG 9275763 â€“ Why is this drawing in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded. 5)DWG 9345327 â€“ Same question as question #1      Currently Olin is the only primer vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;another vendor may be qualified in the future.  6)HCSDS 643 â€“ Why is this in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded.   7) The drawing for the silhouette was not provided with the TDP.      Drawing number 6006874 entitled Target Silhouette â€œEâ€ Kneeling is not part of the TDP.  Please send an email to kgorman@pica.army.mil to request a copy. 8)Is there a TDPL?      The TDPL is Document: 06BBH210A on the CD.  You may right click on the CD  and hit the explore option.  There is a version of the TDPL (06BBH210A) in  Adobe and in WordPad.  You may access the TDPL using either of the two programs.  9)Is there a drawing or more information about the tube the rounds are  placed in with the ammo can?      The dimensions of the tube are in lower right side of drawing 9209204.  In  the upper left side of the same drawing there is a â€œLIST OF PARTSâ€ box.  Line #12 and remarks C and F under the list of parts box give the specifications the  tubes are governed by.  If you look up the specifications it will give further  information on how the tube should be constructed. In regard to the solicitation: 1)Page 1 of 101 â€“ the Government says see schedule for deliver.  We  believe it says later F.O.B. origin. Please confirm with location.      Reference page 14 for Delivery information.  All items are F.O.B Origin. 2)Page 1 of 101- The government has identified the NAISC code as 332992.   Is this correct.  Ammunition over 30mm is typically 332993.        Reference page 1 block 10 and page 6 paragraph 5, the NAICS code shall be  corrected to state 332993,  the Size Standard Shall remain 1500.    3)Page 1 (& 67) of 101 â€“ The Government has identified this contract as  a small business set aside.  What is the governmentâ€™s interpretation of the  employee size and annual sales as it applies to small business and this SIC code?  What is the government interpretation in regard to subsidiaries, joint  ventures, etc.  What is the governments level of interest in ensuring that this  is awarded to true small business?  Will there be any requirement or  investigation beyond the standard SBA response of â€˜self certificationâ€™ without  independent 3rd party evaluation.        Since this solicitation involves furnishing a manufactured product, the size standard is stated in number of employees (in this solicitation that is 1,500), there is no annual sales figure involved.  The employees of any company  affiliated with an offeror (whether it is a parent company, sister company,  subsidiary, etc.) would have to be included in the total employee count.  In  federal acquisition there is no certification process for small business other  than self certification. Therefore an independent 3rd party evaluation will not  be a requirement.  However, any interested party can initiate a size protest if  the size of a business is in question.    4)Page 10 of 101 â€“ CLINs 0005 through 0009 require that the contractor  must produce at a minimum rate of 40,000 per month, yet the first pricing tier  could be only 50,000 units.  Therefore the contractor would have to produce  40,000 the first month and then 10,000 the next month.  Is it not possible to split the award quantity over a span that would allow for continuous production  for a few months?      It is possible that the award will spread out to allow for continuous  production for a few months.  However, for bidding purposes assume a minimum  rate 40,000 per month. In your example this would mean 40,000 the first month  and then 10,000 the next month. 5)Page 10 of 101 â€“ In the situation noted above the contractor could be idle for several months of a continuous 12 month period.  From the point of  award of option 2, after being idle several months, what is the expected ramp  up timeframe?      Depending on if we exercise the Max. Range or not, the typical ramp-up  time for full-scale production would be 6 to 8 months for a small Contractor. 6)Page 10 of 101 â€“ Will the contractor be allow to deliver at amounts  greater than 40,000 in advance of actual delivery requirements?      The contractor is required to submit a proposal based on the delivery  schedule and quantity in the solicitation.  However, after contract award this  issue could be readdressed.  7)Page 21 of 101 â€“ States Bars codes required.  Attachment 8 and age 59  says 2D barcode.  Is not all DOD now 3D bar code required?        The 2D barcode is correct. 8)In response to question 1 regarding the TDP DWG 9209204 â€“ P7, Page 21 of  101- States no Government Furnish Property shall be provided.  This shall be  modified to state Government Furnished Property shall be provided since the Government will be providing the operatorâ€™s instructions pamphlet.  On page 23- of 101 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property Short Form shall be added to this  solicitation 9)  Page 25 of the solicitation AIE Clause (ARDEC 34) paragraph b.  states â€œ(except for any AIE listed as available in section H or appendix I)â€.  We are unable to find Section H or Appendix I.       Since this is a commercial contract not subject to the uniform contract  format (UCF), there are no sections.  Please reference page 16 for a basic  guide when clauses reference a UCF section.  In ARDEC 34 which reference H or  appendix I (52.212-1  or 52.212-4), there is no AIE listed as available in the  referenced sections.   10)Page 31 of 101 â€“ Does TACOM have MSDS from current inventory of M1006?        There is no MSDS for the M1006. 11)Page 33 of 101-The schedule listed on Page 14 of the solicitation  identified First Article being required 210 Days ADC. The First Article â€“  Contractor Testing Clause found on page 33 identifies a 180 day requirement for  submittal of the FAT report.      Page 34 shall be corrected to read 210 calendar days.  12)Page 44 of 101- 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation- Is it a requirement to have unique item identifiers on each ammunition?     A unique item identifier is not required on the individual ammunitions.  The solicitation shall be revised to remove items listed under 252.211-7003 (c)  (1)(ii). 13)  Page 58 of 101 â€“ 3.1.3 Design Verification Test â€“ If this is the  governmentsâ€™ design/TDP in what instances will a DVT be required or not required?      If the item has been produced before to the technical data package that  the vendor is to use and there have not been any modifications to the design (i.e. Engineering Changes), then the DVT could in theory be waived or just not  conducted.  We would still need to ascertain whether or not the vendorâ€™s  process is capable or â€œrobustâ€ because this is his/her first time producing the  item and First Article Testing (with subsequent Lot Acceptance Testing) is the vehicle to use to do that.  14)  Page 87 of 101 â€“ under proposal format Part â€“B design format.  What is  there a design element if there is a full and functional TDP without clear new  design parameters?      The TDP is for informational purposes only.  When proposing, it is not  required that one build to the TDP.  One can utilize their own design built to  the performance specification.   15)  Page 87 of 101-There are issues with the requirements for the number of  volumes and copies required to be submitted for this solicitation. Page 87 says  Proposal Format a) the proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set  forth in the table below. The table describes four volumes to be submitted.        Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Format paragraph a) shall be revised to  state â€œThe proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set forth in the  table below.â€ 16)  Page 87 of 101-Lists the quantities for Volumes 1,3, & 4 but no requirements for Volume 2.  Also Directions for submittal of Volume 4  (Price/Cost) listed on page 87, paragraph d contradict the requirements listed  for the submission of Volume 4 listed on page 91.       Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Instructions paragraph b shall be revised to state â€œOriginal and four paper copies of Technical, Management Factor and  Past Performance.â€  Paragraph d shall be revised to state â€œTwo electronic  copies of (c) aboveâ€¦..â€  Page 91 of 101 is correct as stated.  17)  Page 89 of 101 - Volume I, Technical part C: Is the listed information  required, if contractor has an up-to-date ISO 9001-2000 Certification, e.g.  design of inspection and testing equipment, quality system plan, etc.?      Reference page 82 of 101 ARDEC 148 Offerorâ€™s Quality Assurance System (b) (1). If you indicate in your response to this solicitation that your quality  system conforms to one of the listed standards in Section E â€“ Higher Level  Contract Quality Requirement FAR 52.246-11, this is a sufficient description. You need not further describe your quality system in your response to the solicitation. 18)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Where do we get copies of ARDEC 148 and ARDEC 34?    As stated on page 22 of 101, Clauses incorporated by reference can be accessed at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Click on local link and select local  clauses.  The clauses are listed in numeric order. 19)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Part B â€“ (b) â€“ To supply test reports and data implies  that the contract must have already produced the round.  Is it a requirement of  the contract that the bidder have produced the round previously?        We are not requiring the round to have been previously produced.  The M1006 solicitation is based on the provided Performance Specification.  The bidder may answer the solicitation with a round that meets the requirements outlined in the Performance Specification.  In the event that another round other than the M1006 is submitted ARDEC would like to review any test data as outlined in the Performance Specification for the round being submitted.  The M1006 has test data generated from previous qualification testing.   20)  Page 89 of 101 - Proposal Instructions, item a) refers to Contract Data  requirements List (DD Form 1423 with blocks 17 and 18 completed).  DD Form 1423  has no Blocks 17 and 18.     Block 17. Price Group and 18. Estimated total price are located in the right margin of the CDLR. 21)  Page 90 of 101- States Volume II Management Factor consists of 3 Parts.  Only two parts Part A and Part B are listed. Please Clarify.    Page 90 of 101 shall be corrected to stated Volume II-Management Factor  Consists of 2 parts. 22)  Page 92 of 101 â€“ Does the government have a spreadsheet like this it is  could provide to all contractors, so that there are no formula or mathematical  errors that could adversely effect the award of the contract?     It is not necessary for the Government to supply this spreadsheet to all  contractors.  This is just a sample of how the weighted guidelines will be  computed.  When submitting a proposal one only need to provide a price for each  line item and quantity range.  The Governmentâ€™s Price analysis will perform the  weighted average analysis for total price. 23)  Page 98 of 101 â€“ Evaluation of offers TDP.  Please explain what there is a  separate TDP from the government supplied TDP?     One can submit a technical data package based on the performance  specifications.  It is not a requirement to follow the Governmentâ€™s TDP.  The Governmentâ€™s TDP is for informational purposes only.   24)  General â€“ Is there a page limitation?      There is no page limit. 25)  General â€“ Do each section of the proposal need to stand alone?  I.E. â€“ If  we discuss additional quality aspects outside of the quality section (Technical Factor, Part C) as they relate to another area will these comments be included  in the overall evaluation?  If not, MAST may have to be more repetitive to  ensure that each section has adequate content.        When submitting the proposal it is best to be as clear as possible.  Iâ€™d  suggest addressing each section as a stand alone.  If this is not practicable,  please reference the specific.   26)  General-This solicitation includes a performance specification and  drawings.  Does our submission have to meet the performance specification only  and are we free to use our design?  Alternatively, must we adhere to the  supplied drawings and the performance specification?       The item does need to meet the performance specification. You may use your own design, however, it still must meet the requirements in the performance spec.The technical data package (TDP) is for informational purposes only.  You can choose to design to the TDP, but it is not a requirement of this solicitation.

<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only one responsible source  and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This agency intends to award to The Council of State Governments, 2760 Research Park Dr, Lexington KY 40511-8410


Prior to USCENTCOM initiating action to procure the required support for this seminar, research was completed to determine if other disaster management subject matter experts with the same skill sets were available and willing to do work in the Horn of Africa.  The only organization accredited to evaluate Disaster Management Programs is EMAP.  EMAP has been contracted to conduct evaluations of all 50 states.  The “EMAP Standard” is a set of comprehensive standards that can be applied to an emergency management program of any size; national-level governments are not an exception. Components of the standard address emergency preparedness, response, and recovery from terrorist acts, natural disasters, and other catastrophic incidents. 

EMAP is ideally suited to conduct training on emergency management doctrine for foreign professionals. Since the EMAP Commission was seated in 2002, EMAP has trained more than 300 state and local emergency management professionals to be peer assessors and conducted on-site assessments in approximately 60 state and local jurisdictions. There are more than 675 registered users of the EMAP Online Assessment Tool from the United States and other countries. 
  The EMAP program is a voluntary assessment accreditation process for state/territorial, tribal and local government emergency management programs.  There is no other organization at this time that provides the following:

	Evaluation of a jurisdictions’ emergency preparedness and response system against published national standards
	Structure for identifying areas in need of improvement and benchmarking progress; 
	Means to prioritize resources and demonstrate accountability to the public and elected officials
	Catalyst for improved interoperability and continuity
	Mechanism for sharing best practices among emergency management professionals.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), National Hurricane Center (NHC), located in Miami, FL, intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for the purchase of a GVAR Linux Upgrade on a sole source basis from Global Imaging, Solana Beach, CA, based on the following reasons:  1) NHC needs to upgrade its hardware and software for receiving direct broadcast GOES GVAR satellite data.  NHC uses this equipment to detect storms in real-time; 2) NHC requires a system suitable for operational use, which is highly reliable and completely automatic.  The NWS NHC wishes to take advantage of software and hardware developed by the NWS using high resolution GOES satellite data.  The system software must, therefore, be plug-compatible with Global Imaging’s COTS software already in use at the NHC for this purpose.  The system software must further produce data files in the NWS HIPS file format and/or McIDAS file format; 3) Because of the agency’s need for high reliability and dropout free performance, the NHC has determined that the system components must meet the following general specifications:  a) In order to protect NHC’s investment in the Earth Station equipment (antenna and receiving equipment), the Earth Station must connect to the computer workstation via the SCSI standard small computer system interface.  b) The Windows-based workstations are not stable enough to meet NHC’s operational needs.  Therefore, the system can only contain LINUX workstations.; 4) Global Imaging is the only known source who manufactures the GOES satellite receiving system in operation at the NHC, and its proprietary LINUX software which meets all the requirements needed by NHC;
 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.  However, all responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Responses can be faxed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and any additional supporting literature.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the following criteria: 1) Demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required equipment.  The applicable NAICS code is 541519.

<DESC>The Administration for Children and Families, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) through the Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, Division of Acquisition Management is providing the following source sought notice to determine the availability of businesses to serve as Intermediaries to conduct activities necessary for the project entitled, “Trafficking Outreach and Victim Identification.”

In October 2000, Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), Public Law 106-386, and was reauthorized in December 2003 by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003, P.L. 108-193.  This legislation emphasizes prosecution of traffickers, protection and assistance to victims of trafficking, and an expansion of U.S. activities internationally to prevent trafficking altogether.  Each year as many as 700,000 people around the world, primarily women and children, are bought, sold, transported and held for the purpose of forced commercial sex or labor.   As a result of the trafficking reauthorization of 2003, benefits and services are provided to certain family members of trafficking victims who have received T visas and may also include services to assist potential victims of trafficking in achieving certification and to assist minor dependent children of victims of severe forms of trafficking.  On September 30, 2003, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC) awarded a 3 year contract entitled, “Rescue and Restore Victims of Human Trafficking,” for the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to Ketchum, Inc.  The contract was for the creation, publication and dissemination of materials and products necessary to conduct a national Human Trafficking Public Awareness campaign.  The Campaign established local anti-trafficking coalitions in 17 cities/states.  In each city, networks or “coalitions” of non-profit and government agencies were formed to help identify and assist trafficking victims, as well as disseminate campaign messages and materials and publicize the issue through their communications network.  Coalition partners may consist of local government personnel, law enforcement, family court and juvenile justice officials, public defenders, community health officials, and local service providers.  The coalitions have been built in the following 17 geographic areas:  Phoenix, Arizona; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Las Vegas, Nevada; Newark, New Jersey; Long Island, New York; Los Angeles and San Francisco, California; Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; Portland, Oregon, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Houston, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Miami and Tampa, Florida.  

The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), ACF is seeking to continue and expand its efforts in 10-15 of those communities through intermediary entitles who will serve as the focal point for an intensification of local outreach and identification of victims of human trafficking.  Each intermediary will subcontract with local anti-trafficking grassroots organizations that identify and work with victims of human trafficking.  In its role as planner, fiscal agent, monitor, and technical assistance provider, the intermediary contractor shall establish and manage the local network of subcontractors.   This project has the following objectives:  1) To increase the number of victims of trafficking who are identified, assisted in leaving the circumstances of their servitude, and connected to qualified service agencies and to the HHS certification process so they may receive the benefits and services to the same extent as refugees; 2) To build on the work accomplished to date within the cities/states establishing a dedicated coalition of key law enforcement personnel, social service providers, local government, and health care, and working collaboratively to end trafficking in their community and to educate the general public through campaign messages and materials; 3) To leverage the strengths of both grassroots groups that are trusted institutions within neighborhoods working with trafficked persons and local intermediaries with the organizational capacity to serve as program managers, fiscal agents, and technical assistance providers to local non-profit and government agencies; 4) To provide financial assistance to existing programs of outreach to populations among which victims of human trafficking may be found to support and expand their success rate in identifying trafficking victims; 5) To connect trafficking victims with local qualified service agencies prepared to assist them, through the “Per Capita Victim Service Benefit” contract; 6) To connect local anti-trafficking efforts with the activities, materials, and assistance of the national “Trafficking Public Awareness Campaign”; and 7) To develop a link between the Intermediary Contractor and the HHS Trafficking Information and Referral Hotline so that information received by the Hotline regarding potential local victims can be relayed in a timely manner to local law enforcement authorities, service providers, and outreach agencies.  Tasks include:  1) As a planner, the offeror would have the responsibility to develop a management plan identifying in detail both the overall context of the human trafficking problem in the local jurisdiction and the local target population the Contractor will focus on and establishing goals and benchmarks for identifying and bring forward trafficking victims; 2)  meetings with the ORR program office to submit a draft management plan, review target population data, performance goals, specifics for sub awards, and performance schedules and timeframes; 3) subcontract with local anti-trafficking grassroots organizations that identify and work with victims of trafficking; 4) providing monthly reports to ORR; 5) provide mentoring and technical assistance to subcontractors and to the local coalition of non-profit and government agencies, to support and improve the quality of identification activities and to build the capacity of the grassroots contractors; 6) serve as the focal point for contact and coordination among HHS-funded Anti-Trafficking Activities, Public Agencies, including law enforcement, legal services, health and social services, and the Grassroots Network; 7) establish and jointly maintain lines of communication among the grassroots network of subcontractors and the Trafficking and Public Awareness Campaign, the Per Capita Benefit Contractors and the Trafficking Information and Referral Hotline so that victims are referred to appropriate, local service providers, campaign strategy materials and media outreach are available locally, and so information from the Hotline is readily available for analysis, follow-up and referral; 8) serve as the focal point for information on trafficking for the local community and provide technical support to agencies that wish to support the broader anti-trafficking effort but which do not receive federal funds.

Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via e-mail by June 16, 2006, 2:00 p.m. local prevailing time, to the Contracting Officer at the following e-mail address:  anita.nearhoof@psc.hhs.gov or pscacquisitions@psc.hhs.gov, reference 06Y009349.

<DESC>1.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), Acquisitions Branch, in Washington, D.C., has a future requirement for the provision of medical claim adjudication services to be provided to all BOP facilities, including Community Correction Centers (halfway houses), throughout the contiguous United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  The primary objective of medical claims adjudication for service providers/contractors paid under Medicare-based rate structures is to ensure compliance with the National Correct Coding Initiative edits.  For fee schedule service providers/contractors, the objective is to ensure compliance with the applicable negotiated fee schedule.  In both cases, key consideration include, but are not limited to, avoidance of duplicate payments and ensuring the BOP complies with the requirements of the Prompt Payment Act and Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS).  The claim adjudication will occur prior to any payments being made by the BOP.  The contract type will be an indefinite delivery, requirements type contract with firm-fixed unit prices for each period of performance.  The contract shall consist of a 12 month base year period with four 12 month option year periods for renewal.

2.  The purpose of publicizing for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a Request for Quotation (RFQ), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing an RFP or RFQ.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 524291 applies.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size for code 524291, particularly if they are a small business (the small business size is $6.5 million).  “Small Business” means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business and women-owned small business.  If business size is transitioning to other than small business within the next 90 days, please indicate as such.

3.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.

4.  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) has been posted along with this Sources Sought Synopsis to provide a more detailed description of the requirement, and for any industry comments.  The SOW is still a work-in-progress, and this is NOT the final version.

5.  It is the Government’s intention to award one contract.  Based upon data collected from the market research, the Government will make a determination whether or not to issue an unrestricted solicitation; however, it reserves the right to make this a small business set-aside based on the interest and technical capabilities received from small business concerns. (Under an unrestricted solicitation, large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.)

6.  Hard copies of the Market Research Questionnaire (MRQ) will not be available.  The MRQ and SOW will be available on or about July 31, 2006, and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov.

All future information concerning the acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be distributed solely through this website.

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare (SPAWAR) Systems Center Charleston intends to purchase 15 EA series EX105 telescoping masts with accessories and 15 EA mast pivot assemblies.  Masts shall be telescopic, extended manually by hand crank.  Pneumatic masts are unacceptable in sandy/dusty environments and are vulnerable to small arms fire.  Masts shall extend to at least 8 meters.  Mast system shall include a HMMWV (High-Mobility Multi- Purpose Wheeled Vehicle) mounting system, enabling masts to be mounted vertically on the TPCS-MPC (Team Portable Collection System - Multi- Platform Capability) vehicle.  Mast mounting system shall be attachable to vehicle without drilling holes in or making any permanent modification to vehicle.  Mast system will support SAS 230 antenna with quick-release mount and RF cable, at a total weight of 32 pounds.  System will operate when fully retracted while moving at 25 mph cross- country; 45 mph on dirt roads, and 60 mph on paved roads.  With SAS 230 antenna and RF cable supported, mast must operate (maximum mast top deflection 5 degrees) fully extended at wind speeds up to 60 mph without using guy ropes, and must withstand 80 mph maximum wind speeds without using guy ropes.  When mast is attached to vehicle, one person within two minutes shall be able to extend mast to full height with specified payload.  Mast must also be removable from vehicle mounting bracket without tools for off-vehicle operation.  For this purpose, all necessary deployment (removal) accessories must be provided in accessory kit bags. No single item (mast body or accessory kit bag) shall weigh over 45 pounds.  One person shall be able to remove the mast from the vehicle and extend it fully, including setting base plate and guy lines, within 10 minutes.  When mounted on the vehicle, mast top height must not exceed 108 inches above ground when retracted to minimize visual signature and vehicle obstruction height.  Mast system must be suitable for worldwide operation in harsh environmental conditions and must be able to complete 1000 deployment cycles (i.e., full extension and retraction) with no failure of any mechanism.  System shall be of commercial-off-the-shelf design requiring no development.  A firm- fixed price contract is contemplated. This notice is for planning purposes. Interested firms are invited to submit VIA EMAIL ONLY to elizabeth.ball@navy.mil documentation, literature, and brochures DEMONSTRATING CAPABILTIES of OFFERED ITEMS. Responses must include (1) firm name, address, and phone number; (2) average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; (3) ownership (e.g., Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-Owned, Veteran-Owned); (4) number of years in business; (5) two contacts, including names, titles, email addresses, phone numbers, and FAX numbers; (6) DUNS number; and (7) affiliate information (e.g., any parent corporation, joint venture partners, teaming partners). This Survey is for information only, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with reponses or any follow-up information.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set- aside based on responses.

<SUBJECT>99 -- NATO Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) Invitation to Participate in an Exhibition on Special Operations Forces (SOF) Technologies and Equipment
<DESC>DESCRIPTION

The Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) is the senior NATO body responsible for promoting cooperation in research and development of technology in support of production and procurement of defense equipment among NATO nations. The CNAD is comprised of the most senior defense procurement officials from all NATO countries.  

Twice a year the CNAD meets at NATO Headquarters in Brussels to discuss investment in military capabilities. During the CNAD meeting on October 25-26, 2006, the NATO Defense Investment Division will host an industrial exhibition. It will give the representatives of a selected group of companies and research establishments from NATO countries and Partnership for Peace (PfP) countries the opportunity to exhibit their products, as well as research and technology developments. Because it will be held at NATO Headquarters, the exhibition will draw the attention of senior military and diplomatic officials located in Brussels, as well as the senior acquisition decision-makers from capitals who will be attending CNAD.

The available space in the Headquarters is limited and therefore the organizers will have to be highly selective. They will strive for a mix of technologies to be shown, giving priority to exhibits that are interactive in nature. They will be looking for both large and small companies and research institutes to be represented, from as many of the NATO and PfP Partner nations as possible. Exhibitors should note that this exhibit will be open to the general NATO and Partner community and will be in a non-restricted area within NATO Headquarters. The focus will be on technologies and equipment for Special Operations Forces (SOF). 

Participation in this event is generally free of charge, i.e., no entrance fee will be requested by NATO. However, NATO will only cover local operating costs (light, heat, electricity). All other expenses (transportation of the equipment to the exhibition site at NATO Headquarters, insurance, setting up the equipment, manning the booth, etc.) will be the responsibility of the exhibitors themselves.

ELIGIBLITY

Requests for participation sent directly to NATO cannot be considered. If your firm would like to apply for participation in this exhibition, you must first complete a Questionnaire that will be provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce. To request a copy of the CNAD Questionnaire, send an email to Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov or Dnewsom@bis.doc.gov.  

The completed Questionnaire must be submitted to the CNAD Exhibition Team no later than 10 August 2006. Instructions for submission will be included with the Questionnaire. Also included will be information on SOFs and their associated requirements. 

The selection of exhibitors will be completed by 7 September 2006. NATO CNAD will inform all applicants, whether selected or not, about the results of the selection process. A handbook that will assist in the set-up for and conduct of the event, will then be sent to the selected exhibitors.

<SUBJECT>--PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT  Joint Integrated Air & Missile Defense Industry Day, August 17-18, 2006.
<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT  Joint Integrated Air & Missile Defense Industry Day, August 17-18, 2006.  On behalf of the Department of Defense (DOD), the Force Protection Functional Capabilities Board (FP FCB) announces a Joint Integrated Air and Missile Def ense (JIAMD) Industry Day for the purpose of identifying potential materiel approaches to mitigating present and foreseen Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability gaps. The JIAMD Industry Day is classified SECRET and will be held at the Lockhee d Martin Corporation Auditorium, 4800 Bradford Drive, Huntsville, AL, on August 17 from 1300 to 1730, and on August 18 from 0800 to 1200. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council has approved the IAMD Joint Capabilities Document and directed three Function al Solutions Analyses (FSAs), as follows: FSA 1:  Detection, Tracking, and Determination of Intent of Asymmetric (Irregular) Air and Cruise Missile Threats to the Homeland. FSA 2:  Detection, Tracking, Engagement and Kill Assessment of Ballistic Missile Threats, to Include Those Equipped with Weapons of Mass Destruction. FSA 3:  Active Air Defense Against Air and Cruise Missile Threats. Lead DOD Sponsor for FSA 1 is the USAF; lead for FSA 2 is the Navy and lead for FSA 3 is the Army.  FSA 1 will also address capability gaps identified in the Homeland Air and Cruise Missile Defense of North America Joint Capabilities Document. In response to recommendations made in the Quadrennial Defense Review, the Defense Acquisition Executive, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Program Analysis and Evaluation are initiating the Concept Decision Experiment.  This experimen t will explore revisions to streamline the DOD acquisition process in part, by conducting a Concept Decision Review early in the process to consider requirements, acquisition, and programming for the identified joint warfighter capability gaps.  This early  decision point is expected to result in fewer program starts but greater stability for the programs that are started.  Since IAMD has been selected as a pilot program for the Concept Decision Experiment, the planned FSAs will be merged with other analytic al activities to produce an Evaluation of Alternatives (EoA).  The JIAMD Industry Day is expected to support the emerging IAMD EoA.  In advance of the JIAMD Industry Day events, it is anticipated that there will be three separate Requests for Information ( RFI) released on or about 1 August 2006.  During the August 17 session, the three Lead DOD Sponsors will present their respective Study Plans, to include discussion of the classified capability gaps assigned to each of the three above listed FSAs.  Each br iefing will be followed by a discussion and question & answer period, to ensure respondents understand the intent of the RFI.  Written questions may be submitted via a template to be provided at the Industry Day.  On August 18, time will be provided for ad ditional discussions and question & answer periods.   FP FCB point of contact is Lt Col Robert O. Watt, 703-602-5395. FSA 1 USAF POC is Major Michael Reschke, 703-601-0155. FSA 2 USN POC is Dr. Gregory Swider, 703-824-2574. FSA 3 & HACMD USA POC is LTC Chr istopher M. Colombo, 703-692-5280. Industry Day attendance is limited to 250 individuals on a first come  first served basis.  No one will be allowed entry without first submitting their clearance information AND then receiving return acknowledgement vi a e-mail that they have been accepted as an attendee.  Interested parties must submit their security clearance information via FAX using the attached format (no substitutions).  Complete the security clearance form (type or print legibly), ensure security authentication, and fax to SAIC Security at (256) 971-7330 NO LATER THAN August 8, 2006.  Be sure to include your e-mail address so we can confirm that your reservation for the Industry Day has been accepted and acknowledged.  Telephone contact is Stacy Tu cker and/or Cat William s (256) 971-7300.  Industry Day parking is limited and fairly remote from the Auditorium where the briefings are to take place.  Please share rides where possible and plan to arrive early.

Technical Requirement/Salient Charateristics: The AFM system shall include a motorized X-Y stage, an electronic controller (that is responsible for controlling all functions on the stage), and a computer.  The system shall provide a video based optical microscope and a computer display with associated software for operating the AFM. The operating software shall provide functions for zooming, focusing, and adjusting the light intensity.  The system shall include offline analysis software for processing (including error correction), display, and reporting of the images.  The system shall allow the operator to cut and paste to Windows™ applications.

The AFM shall have the capability of obtaining images in both the contact mode for hard surfaces and in a mode applicable for compliant surfaces typical of biological specimens. For surface physical properties, the AFM shall be capable of measuring small displacements typical for both lateral force and frictional force microscopy measurements. For enhanced contrast, the phase mode of operation shall be available. The system shall be able to generate force distance curves, obtain images of objects in liquid without capillary action effects on the tip and without dynamic effects caused by salting out as the fluid evaporates. For height and roughness analyses, the system shall be capable of measuring the Z signal accurately for both flat surfaces and large scale features. The operator shall be able to adjust the X sensor input in order to correct hysteresis.

Hardware requirements:
1) Scanner and Scanning Probe Microscope Stage shall be: fully motorized and computer controlled; scan range: ~[100x100] µm XY and ~ 5 µm along the Z (vertical) dimension
real-time calibration of sensors in the X-Y-Z axes; easy cantilever replacement and acceptance of the pre-mounted cantilevers; capable of many scanning modes including contact mode, close contact mode, lateral force mode, material sensing mode, and force distance curve; mechanism for scanning at different angles.

2) Video-based optical microscope system shall have variable zoom magnification; motorized zoom and focus; color CCD camera detector; resolution ~1.5µm.

3) Environmental Cell or Cantilever Holder for scanning biological samples shall have: device that allows the sample to be scanned in liquid environments; capable of being easily attached to AFM mount.

Part IV: Price Quote Your price quote shall be a separate volume from your technical quote (reference section 8).   As a result of this acquisition, the Government anticipates awarding a Labor Hour task order under GSA Schedule. Your price quotation shall be based on your current GSA Schedule contract labor rates. The Government anticipates a competitive response from industry in response to this RFQ, and offerors are encouraged to discount their listed GSA Schedule contract labor rates. If a discount is provided each vendor shall show in this section the contract rate and the rate proposed as discounted.  A separate price summary shall be provided for the base period and each option period. A cumulative summary price sheet shall be submitted, which shall be inclusive of the base period and all option periods. The Offeror must identify the labor category(s) to be utilized for this effort, a description of the skills and experience per category, and the hourly rate(s) proposed, and any other proposed associated costs, for calculating the proposed cost for this effort. Subcontractor rate information shall also be included, if applicable. The vendor shall also provide a listing of all other direct costs and travel detail. 9. BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable price.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than price; however, between quotes that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the low priced quoter if the superior technical submission, or the submission indicating a reduced performance risk, warrants paying a premium.  Award will be made on a "Best Value" basis. 10.  EVALUATION FACTORS: There are a total of five (5) evaluation factors. There are three (3) technical factors:  A. Management Approach and Technical Capabilities, B. Personnel Qualifications, and C. Organizational Experience, one (1) past performance factor and one (1) price factor.  The three technical factors are of equal importance.  The technical factors are more important than past performance and price. The past performance factor is more important than price.  As such, the technical factors and past performance factor in combination are more important than price.  Selection of the firm to perform this task order will be based on the Government's assessment of the best overall value. Technical proposals will be given adjective ratings. Quotes will be reviewed and evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria identified below: 10.1 TECHNICAL QUOTE (Part II) A.	Management Approach and Technical Capabilities 1.

Statement of Work

 
Statement of Work
1.	    Objective

Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), intends to acquire a complete system that will take XML statistical data sets as input and output print ready copy in the form of Adobe Postscript Files (PDF).  This system will be as automated as practical, will reside in BLS offices in the Postal Square Building, and be operated and administered by BLS personnel.

2.		Background

BLS is the principal fact-finding agency for the Federal Government in the broad field of labor economics and statistics. BLS is an independent national statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential statistical data to the American public, the U.S. Congress, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, business, and labor. 

BLS provides its data in a variety of formats including digital formats such as web pages on the Internet (examples here: http://stats.bls.gov ), and printed ink and paper formats for items like news releases (an example can be seen here: http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf ).  

One of the primary methods for representation of BLS data, either in print or electronic form, is through the use of statistical tables.  Representation of tables in a print environment is more complex than it is in a web environment due to the more restrictive size of a standard printed page verses the virtually unlimited size of a web page.  Currently BLS requires substantial manual manipulation of the layout for printed output to ensure that tables, and to a lesser degree, text and graphics are displayed in a sensible and readable fashion.   

BLS extracts the data to be formatted for dissemination from a central database in the form of an XML dataset, which is transformed into HTTP formatted pages for display on the Bureau’s web site.

3.	Scope of Work

3.1.	Tasks

3.1.1.	Analyze the formatted examples, as identified in Section 7 of the Statement of Work, and develop a system that will convert the XML data sets, also provided in Section 7 below, to the same layout and format as the examples provided, and in a file format that is suitable for copy ready printing (e.g. PDF), and meets all requirements as listed in this document.

3.1.2.	Develop reusable templates that will allow the conversion of future XML data sets that require similar formatting, to a copy ready file format.

3.2.	Deliverables

3.2.1.	A software system which converts XML data sets to camera ready PDF files for printed distribution and meets the requirements in this document. 

3.2.2.	Source code for all executable software developed in response for this project.

3.2.3.	Reusable templates for the conversion of XML to PDF.

3.2.4.	Documentation of the system that is built including all licensing information for any COTS software used in this solution.

3.3.	Requirements

3.3.1.	The source XML has been defined by BLS.  The solution shall use this XML.
3.3.2.	The solution shall provide a default presentation layout for any XML table, which can be manually adjusted by a BLS designer for individual tables.
3.3.3.	Once a table presentation layout has been defined, the conversion of XML to PDF shall be fully automated and will require no manual intervention at run time.
3.3.4.	The solution shall be implemented in Java and run on a Sun/Solaris platform in order to be compatible with the existing production environment.
3.3.5.	The camera ready copy (PDF) shall be in black and white and contain statistical tables of varying length, text, graphics, header and footer information, footnotes, and may contain multiple fonts.
3.3.6.	The layout of the statistical tables shall support multiple levels of nested column headings, spanned across columns, and multiple levels of nested row headings, indicated through indentation.
3.3.7.	Statistical tables will vary in length and some will extend over multiple pages.  Long tables shall be broken across page boundaries at appropriate places, with the position of page breaks to be automatically determined by the software (allowing for a manual override where necessary.)
3.3.8.	Column header information and footnotes shall be repeated on new pages when tables span multiple pages.
3.3.9.	Statistical tables shall have a varying number of columns. The default size of each column must be automatically determined by its contents, with the possibility of design-time overrides of the defaults.
3.3.10.	Columns containing Numeric data shall be wide enough to display the data and associated footnotes on one line (subject to the constraints of page width.)
3.3.11.	Columns and headers containing text shall be hyphenated as needed to fit within the boundaries of the cell.
3.3.12.	Table layouts shall support decimal-point alignment when specified for a particular column.
3.3.13.	The solution shall be capable of running in an IPv6 environment, or documented plans shall exist for a timetable for implementation of any necessary enhancements required for proper functionality in an IPv6 environment.
3.4.	Constraints

3.4.1.	The vendors must provide a statement of how the applicable Federal 508 requirements are addressed.
3.4.2.	The source XML datasets specify content and structure.  As such they do not, and should not, contain presentation information. Style sheets containing presentation information do not currently exist.

3.5.	Acceptance and Quality Control

3.5.1.	All software (and hardware if applicable) will be evaluated in a simulated BLS computing environment to determine that the solution meets the functional and system requirements set forth in this document as well as BLS security, networking, and usage guidelines applicable to software and hardware permitted to run in the BLS computing environment.
3.5.2.	Acceptance shall be further defined as beneficial use by BLS. Acceptance will be deemed “in full” upon receipt by the Vendor of a Notice of Acceptance issued by BLS upon beneficial use and full implementation of the Terms and Conditions and Technical Specifications of the Contract. Upon receipt of the Notice of Acceptance, The Vendor shall notify BLS in writing of a release of all liens for all materials and services associated with this project.



4.	 Contractor Qualifications.

4.1.1.	The contractor shall provide a Project Manager who will act as a single point of contact for all activities regarding this project. 
4.1.2.	The selected contractor shall be fully capable and experienced in the area of XML and XML to copy ready format conversions.  To ensure the system has continued support, BLS will contract only with vendors demonstrating a successful history of building XML to copy ready format solutions. During the evaluation process, BLS may, with full cooperation of the vendors, visit the vendors’ places of business, observe operations, and inspect records. 
4.1.3.	BLS may, with full cooperation of the vendors, visit reference clients.  Specified visits and discussion shall be arranged through the vendors. 

5.	Data
BLS will own all products outputted from this project except where licensed COTS software is used.  In the case of COTS BLS shall receive all rights and benefits of usage for the duration of the licensing period for any licensed COTS software that is included in the solution.

6.	Security and Clearance

6.1	The contractor will have access to no BLS facilities, BLS computer systems, or to any confidential information in carrying out this project.

6.2	If BLS chooses to  exercise the optional consulting services for FY 2007 or 2008 identified in section 8 (Period of Performance) of this document, and the vendor is required to be on site at the BLS facilities the, following will apply:
6.2.1	The contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures that implement HSPD-12, OMB guidance M-05-24, and FIPS Pub 201.
6.2.2	The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have physical access to a Federal controlled facility or a access to a Federal information system.

7	Government-Furnished Property
7.1	Example documents representing the desired output format and layout.
7.2	XML data sets.

8	Period of Performance
Six (6) months from the date of the award with an option for additional consulting in FY 2007 and 2008.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared and processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This is a Solicitation from the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill, AFB FL to provide seven (7) General Standards Corporation Analog Input Board:  P/N CPC16U-24DSI32R-32-ELD-C-AA1; 6U, 24-Bit, 32 Channel, Extended Low Distortion with the option for an additional seven (7) units.  This constitutes the only Request For Quote (RFQ), written quotes are being requested; and a written RFQ will not be issued.  DOC, CASC requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR.     For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number.     A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.  This notice is hereby issued as RFQ No. 
NAAN6000601413CMM.  This RFQ and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-11.  The line item(s) will be provided in accordance with the specifications listed below.  The prices shall be all inclusive of costs.  These are analog interface boards that will be installed and will operate within a Configurable AAMPS Module (CAM).  Designed and developed for airborne atmospheric research applications, the CAM is a computer data acquisition system that is unique to the NOAA AOC.  The CAM prototype development uses specific hardware and software components and involves approximately 21 man-months of work and $400K of Government funding.  The success of its production version relies heavily on the prototype design – it is vital to the system reliability to utilize the same hardware and software components that were selected during the initial development of the CAM system.  The model and part-number for the requested components have been researched and they have been tested and proven as the overall best choice for the CAM.  By forcing competition for the purchase of these items, the quality of the CAM may be degraded if a different vendors’ product is purchased.  If that were the case, then the hardware and software integration work for the devices will need to be redone, incurring additional cost and a substantial project delay.  This purchase is driven by the need to produce multiple CAM systems.  That is, to build up copies of the prototype CAM, which was built during the development phase.}  The FAR clauses incorporated into this acquisition shall be:  52.211-8 Time of Delivery Alt I.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared and processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This is a Solicitation from the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill, AFB FL to provide six (6) Brandywine Communications Time Synch Module:  PMC-GPSCLOCK-HQIN-M12-NOAA1 or equivalent and the option for eleven (11) additional units.  This constitutes the only Request For Quote (RFQ), written quotes are being requested; and a written RFQ will not be issued.  DOC, CASC requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR.     For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number.     A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.  This notice is hereby issued as RFQ No. 
NAAN6000601416CMM.  This RFQ and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-11.  The line item(s) will be provided in accordance with the specifications listed below.  The prices shall be all inclusive of costs.  The items to be purchased are time-synchronization boards that will be installed and will operate within a Configurable AAMPS Module (CAM).  Designed and developed for airborne atmospheric research applications, the CAM is a computer data acquisition system that is unique to the NOAA AOC.  The CAM prototype development uses specific hardware and software components and involves approximately 21 man-months of work and $400K of Government funding.  The success of its production version relies heavily on the prototype design – it is vital to the system reliability to utilize the same hardware and software components that were selected during the initial development of the CAM system.  The model and part-number for the requested components have been researched and they have been tested and proven as the overall best choice for the CAM.  By forcing competition for the purchase of these items, the quality of the CAM may be degraded if a different vendors’ product is purchased.  If that were the case, then the hardware and software integration work for the devices will need to be redone, incurring additional cost and a substantial project delay.  This purchase is driven by the need to produce multiple CAM systems.  That is, to build up copies of the prototype CAM, which was build during the development phase.  The FAR clauses incorporated into this acquisition shall be:  52.211-8 Time of Delivery Alt I. (APR 1984) {the delivery dates are based on the assumption that the Government will make an award by August 24, 2006.}, 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors – Commercial Items (Jan. 2006), 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (Jun. 2006), 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items (Sep. 2005), 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items (Jun. 2006) (Sections 5,14, 15,16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 26, and 31), 52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity – Separately Priced Line Item (Mar. 1989) {The Government may require the delivery of the numbered line item, identified in the Schedule as an option item, in the quantity and at the price stated in the Schedule.  The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 60 day.  Delivery of added items shall continue at the same rate that like items are called for under the contract, unless the parties otherwise agree.}, 52.247-35 FOB Destination, Within Consignee’s Premises (Apr.1984).  FAR clauses are available on the Internet Website http://www.arnet.gov/far.  The following Commerce Acquisition Regulations (CAR) are also incorporated into this acquisition by reference:  1352.201-70 Contracting Officer’s Authority (Mar. 2000), 1352.211-70 Statement of Work/Specifications (Mar. 2000), 1352.215-77 Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (March 2000) {The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this request to the responsible offeror whose quotation conforming to request results in the best value to the Government, price and other technical factors considered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number NFFK0-6-332 is issued as a request for quotation.  In its final report, the U.S. Ocean Commission states that the “biggest threat to marine mammals worldwide is their accidental capture or entanglement in fishing gear (bycatch), which kills hundreds of thousands of them each year.” Bycatch is a serious and widespread threat to marine mammals and there is an urgent need to develop alternative fishing gear and practices to reduce marine mammal interactions worldwide and to put into place effective regional agreements on mitigation measures ranging from temporal and spatial closures of fisheries to the use of deterrent technologies.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) addresses international threats to marine mammals and provides the United States with the tools to take a leadership role in reducing bycatch [16 USC 1378(a)]  in US and International waters.   The NOAA/NMFS Office of International Affairs is in a unique position to engage foreign nations and multilateral organizations to make progress on reducing marine mammal bycatch.  This work request is to identify and evaluate international marine mammal conservation efforts, and to develop an international marine mammal conservation action plan for NOAA.  The resultant plan will provide a clear blueprint for international action that includes measures that can be taken and implemented through regional agreements to target areas of high risk and identify a broader, long-term international strategy to tackle the global threats to marine mammals.  Specifically, the contractor shall complete the following tasks: (1) Review and summarize current mandates related to international marine mammal conservation; (2) Assess the relevancy and effectiveness of international conservation activities currently underway by various Regional Commissions, treaties (e.g., Convention for Biological Diversity, Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife Protocol, South Pacific Regional Environment Program), and individual country and bilateral efforts; (3) Evaluate and present the most significant threats to marine mammals, the affected species and the geographic areas of high risk, and the recommended actions from various independent fora  (e.g., Ocean Commission, Pew Commission, IWC scientific committee); (4) Identify gaps in conservation and management efforts related to threats to marine mammal populations and identify opportunities for international action, cooperative research and information exchange; and (5) Develop a strategic plan of action for NOAA that identifies priorities and resource needs. Period of Performance:  Date of Award through January 6, 2007.  The resulting purchase order shall be negotiated on a firm fixed basis.  The budgeted amount for this requirement is $19,800.00.  The award shall be made on a best value basis using simplified acquisition procedures and commercial acquisition procedures.  Quotes will be evaluated while relatively equal are listed by importance based upon approach, past performance, and price.  The solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Number 2005-11.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number NFFK0-6-333 is issued as a request for quotation.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541990.  In the U.S., an active and organized sea turtle stranding network has been developed and continues to be improved in order to quantify the seasonality, species composition, stock structure, life history stage, sex ratio, and distribution of turtles that wash ashore dead or alive.  The stranding network endeavors to identify both anthropogenic and natural casual factors of mortality with the hope of identifying mortality factors and implementing sound management and conservation measures.  Due to its endangered status, strandings involving the Kemp’s ridley, Lepidochelys kempii receive a great deal of attention from federal regulatory agencies charged with enforcing the Endangered Species Act as well as fishing industry interest whose fishing activities may be affected by management actions.   The specified work will facilitate the continuation of stranding surveys on the Tamaulipas, Mexico coastline to document mortality and to evaluate potential causative factors.  More data are needed to get a realistic idea of the level of sea turtle strandings in any geographical locale.  Prior to the initiation of stranding surveys in Mexico in 2001, data in Mexico were anecdotal at best and were only recorded during the months of nesting activity at the principal nesting beaches, and then, only when time permitted.  Mexico implements a shrimp closure which coincides with the Kemp’s ridley sea turtle nesting season so that this period likely represents low levels of sea turtle strandings.  The fact that 23 of 24 adult make Kemp’s ridleys tagged in recent satellite telemetry studies remained in the La Pesca to Tampico area during at least part of the period outside the nesting season further supports the need for additional stranding data outside of the nesting season.  The objectives of this action are: Continue year-round, expanded stranding surveys along the Tamaulipus coastline of Mexico.  Ensure that accurate location and stranding data are collected for each documented stranding.  Enchance knowledge of mortality factors operating on the population through documentation and reporting of results, including necropsy data as practicable.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  (1) Conduct three time/week patrols from the Tepehuajes, Rancho Nuevo, Barra del Tordo, Altamira and La Pesca camps.  These patrols will cover the prime sectors of the Kemp’s ridley habitat.  Surveys will be conducted during the period of September 15, 2006 to August 31, 2007; (2) Patrol leaders will be permanently located at each of the five field camps and responsible for security at each of the camps to prevent vandalism which translates into annual savings to the program; (3) Collect GPS location data for each stranding location, as well as detailed biological information on each stranded turtle that includes checking for internal and external tags.

<DESC>The NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service has the need to study marine mammal behavioral psychophysics.  These services will be acquired using simplified acquisition procedures, FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  The statement of work is as follows:  Statement of Work: Marine Mammal Behavioral Psychophysics:  Adaptive Behavioral Techniques for Obtaining Hearing Data :  Background :  How marine animals hear and are affected by human noise sources are critical and largely unanswered questions relevant to NOAA’s ability to manage protected species under federal statutes (MMPA and ESA).  Hearing measurements have been obtained from captive animals trained to respond to sounds with various behavioral responses.  These procedures can provide highly accurate measurements of hearing capabilities, but are unfortunately limited because of the extensive time required for training and testing individual subjects.  A needed advancement in understanding and managing the effects of noise on protected species is enhancing behavioral procedures to allow more rapid assessments of hearing.  

Adaptive techniques involving continual tracking of hearing, as opposed to discrete responses, hold significant promise and are relatively commonly used with people and other terrestrial mammals but have never been used with marine mammals.  Such procedures could provide critical comparative data and increase testing capabilities by orders of magnitude.  Behavioral methods in which subjects are trained to rapidly modulate responses to changing acoustic stimuli may further prove optimal in carefully assessing frequency weighting functions and the recovery of hearing following controlled noise exposure in studies of temporary hearing loss.  

Tasks: This statement of work calls for the development of novel behavioral techniques with marine mammal subjects trained to participate in adaptive response procedures and the application of such techniques to address basic and applied questions of importance to NOAA’s management capabilities.  Researchers supported by this contract will:

1)	Develop hardware and software for obtaining behavioral hearing data from marine mammals using adaptive behavioral procedures (e.g., behavioral method of adjustment (MOA)). 
2)	Train marine mammal subjects to perform adaptive procedures.
3)	Obtain “absolute” hearing thresholds and compare results with existing behavioral and electrophysiological data. 
4)	Develop and implement advanced applications of adaptive procedures, such as the recovery of hearing sensitivity following noise exposure and subjective measures such as loudness. 

Deliverable:  A report of the results of the study will be provided to NMFS upon completion of the work..  Period of Performance: Twelve(12) months
