This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Description:<br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders. The NIMH mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of mental disease.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The National Institute of Mental Health Administrative Services Branch requires the delivery and installation of new furniture for two administrative suites within Building 31 (2B34 and 3B55). Both suites are undergoing complete renovations and at the completion of construction, will have no furniture.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:<br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide furniture for a total of 24 staff at 2 locations (31/2B34 and 31/3B55), partial glass modular furniture walls between 17 private offices and the breakroom/meeting room in 2B34, and entry doors for each private office and the breakroom/meeting room. Glass modular furniture wall will attach to bottom of the bulkheads, which are at 8'4" in height. Glass will also be partially frosted to accommodate privacy. Please see attached floor plan. Delivery and installation cost should be included in the proposal.</p>
<p>Project requirements: <br />The contractor shall provide the NIMH with two of the following:</p>
<p>Phase 1: Office Suite 2B34<br />&bull; 1 supervisory office (2B34H)<br />o L shaped workstation with half modesty panel (larger than staff offices)<br />&#61607; Hutch with closed cabinet doors<br />&#61607; 2 pedestals - 1 fixed box box file and 1 mobile with cushion<br />&#61607; Tack board and task lighting<br />o 1 adjustable height table 24" x 48"<br />&bull; 11 private staff offices<br />o L shaped workstations with half modesty panels<br />&#61607; Hutch with closed cabinet doors<br />&#61607; 2 pedestals - 1 fixed box box file and 1 mobile with cushion<br />&#61607; Tack board and task lighting<br />&bull; 1 reception desk with reception counter<br />o Hutch with closed cabinet doors<br />o 1 fixed box box file<br />o Tack board and task lighting<br />&bull; 1 other desk in open area<br />o Hutch with closed cabinet doors<br />o 1 fixed box box file<br />o Tack board and task lighting<br />&bull; 1 hoteling desk in corridor<br />&bull; 1 oval conference table for 8 in breakroom/meeting room (will need to be wired for presentation hook-up)<br />&bull; 14 office chairs<br />&bull; 35 guest chairs - stackable with wheels<br />&bull; 14 36" 2 drawer filing cabinets<br />&bull; 1 36" 5 drawer filing cabinet</p>
<p>Phase 2: Office Suite 3B55</p>
<p>&bull; 5 private staff offices<br />o L shaped workstations with half modesty panels<br />&#61607; Hutch with closed cabinet doors<br />&#61607; 2 pedestals - 1 fixed box box file and 1 mobile with cushion<br />&#61607; Tack board and task lighting<br />&bull; 5 desks in open area<br />o 5 workstations with privacy screening from each other<br />&#61607; Additional screening where a workstation may adjoin private office glass<br />&#61607; Hutch with closed cabinet doors<br />&#61607; 1 mobile pedestal with cushion<br />&#61607; Tack board and task lighting<br />&bull; 1 round 42" diameter conference table in breakroom/meeting room<br />&bull; 10 office chairs<br />&bull; 14 guest chairs - stackable with wheels<br />&bull; 2 counter height chairs<br />&bull; 7 36" 2 drawer filing cabinets<br />&bull; 4 36" 5 drawer filing cabinets</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance:<br />Delivery and installation shall begin upon receipt of order.</p>
<p>Other important considerations: <br />Delivery of purchases will occur in 2 phases because the renovation of the space the furniture will go is happening in 2 phases (occupants of both spaces are using the same swing space so the phase 1 needs to go into their new space, with furniture, before phase 2 can move out to begin the second phase of renovation). In case all the furniture is procured for both phases at the same time, storage of the phase 2 furniture will need to occur until the space is ready.</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party especially a small business, believes they can meet the above requirement, may submit a quote and statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-2016-683 on all correspondence.</p>

The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.</p>
