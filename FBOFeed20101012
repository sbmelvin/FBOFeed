The Contractor shall perform at a minimum the following: 1. install the Government's existing transmission systems on-board Contractor-owned aircraft in strict compliance with the original electronic design configuration, 2. make all on-board systems operational and insure propagation parameters are met, and 3. perform and maintain the necessary air services to operate "AeroMarti" for up to 6 days/week broadcast/mission flight schedule. The contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, tools, equipment, materials, documentation, reports, supplies, services testing, licenses, permits, parts, materials and shipping as necessary to perform the required services. Those who are interested are advised that the Contractor must be able to install the above referenced broadcast equipment into its aircraft and make it fully operational for broadcasting without any disruption or break in service to the ongoing daily "AeroMarti" mission.

In addition, the Contractor will be required to submit an aircraft system integration plan with its proposal for review and approval by the Government. The period of performance will include an initial one year with annual renewal options up to 5 years.

<CONTACT>Vincent Lynch, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-366-3339, Fax 202-366-9555, Email vincent.lynch@dot.gov
<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a requirement to explore the predictive validity of Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC) program tests. NHTSA's Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) directs a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting the development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors. Research areas include: alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints, speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers, driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services, and emergency medical services. The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations. Examples of these studies can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Research investigating the impairing effects of various drugs on a driver's ability to safely operate his/her car has not been definitive. Tests used to assess impairment from drug use are usually developed for the specific study in which they are used, and are, in many cases, unstandardized. Those tests used more widely, especially by law enforcement officers, have not been specifically validated to determine impairment based on drug use (other than those that have been thusfar standardized for determining recent alcohol use). Law enforcement officers who are certified as Drug Recognition Experts (DREs) are trained to utilize a variety of readily observable signs and symptoms that are accepted in the medical community as reliable indicators of drug influence. The program enables officers to determine whether a suspect is under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs; and if so, the DRE combines basic medical knowledge about drug pharmacodynamics with the administration of psychomotor tests to determine the category of drugs. This form of training is costly in time (it is a 9-day course) and resources.</p>
<p>During an evaluation, the DRE collects information on the suspects's current condition, a brief medical history, and also assesses the suspect's pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, pupil size and reaction to light, and psychomotor function. The DRE also examines the suspect's visual tracking, visual convergence, smooth pursuit and Horizontal and Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (HGN and VGN, respectively). This information is documented consistently on a form, the Drug Influence Evaluation (DIE) "Face Sheet", by all DREs. Using the DIE, the DRE captures about 60 different elements, in numerical, pictorial and narrative form. The DRE also summarizes his or her observations in a narrative statement. Based on the information gathered, the DRE determines whether the subject is under the influence of drugs, the specific category of drugs, and requests that the suspect provide a biological specimen for confirmation.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>There has been no systematic investigation of whether it is necessary for the DREs to collect all of the information or whether a core set of the measures are more directly relevant. Therefore, the OBSR is interested in conducting a study to collect and code all the information found on a large sample of DIE data sheets to determine which combination(s) elements coalesce to predict the toxicology-confirmed results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The objectives of this study are to:<br />(a) gather a sample of DIE Face Sheets from several Law Enforcement Agencies that participate in the DEC Program along with the corresponding toxicological test results based on blood samples;<br />(b) code the numerical, pictorial, and narrative information found on the data sheets and the confirmation results, and create a database of measures from the sample;<br />(c) determine accuracy of the DRE opinions using the corresponding toxicological confirmation results; and<br />(d) analyze the data to identify of groups of interrelated variables to see how they are correlated to each other and the drug class confirmed by blood samples.</p>
<p><br />Solicitation Information:</p>
<p>The Government contemplates that a Time and Material type Contract with a period of performance not to exceed eighteen (18) months will be awarded. The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at https://www.fedbizopps.gov referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22-10-R-00376). The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about May 7, 2010. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</p>
<p>NO FURTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVALABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue solicitation N00024-10-R-2400 for the accomplishment of Fitting Out Availability (FOA) for LPD 22 (SAN DIEGO) with an option for the accomplishment of Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) for LPD 22 (SAN DIEGO).  This solicitation shall also contain options for the accomplishment of FOA and PSA for LPD 23 (ANCHORAGE) and LPD 25 (SOMERSET)*.  For LPD 22, efforts will include an eight-week FOA in early FY12 to complete system installations and capabilities that were not part of the basic construction and that are necessary to support ship Post Delivery Test & Trials (PDT&T).  A PSA of up to sixteen weeks for LPD 22 will follow later in FY12.  For LPD 23, efforts will include an eight-week FOA in early FY13, followed by a PSA of up to sixteen weeks in FY13.
  For LPD 25, efforts will include an eight-week FOA in mid-FY13 followed by a PSA of up to sixteen weeks in early FY14.  FOA/PSA efforts include all manpower, support services, material, and associated technical data and documents required to prepare for and accomplish these availabilities.  The work to be accomplished will include correction of Government responsible deficiencies, installation of approved engineering changes (that were not incorporated during the construction period) and new work identified between ship delivery and the start of FOA/PSA.  Efforts will include engineering and management support of FOA/PSAs, testing and post repair sea trials, and other emergent work.  The proposed contract will include scope to allow for emergent availabilities to correct Government responsible deficiencies identified after delivery that must be corrected to support test and trials prior to the start of the FOA/PSA.
  During FOA/PSA, the ships will be made available for completion of Fleet funded repairs and changes.  Work on these three vessels will take place in the homeport area of San Diego, California.  Third party access must be granted for the purpose of allowing work to be performed by Government Alteration Installation Team (AIT) and to allow the building yard to complete unfinished and warranty work.  A responsible offer will be considered eligible if the offeror has previously executed a master agreement for repairs and alterations of vessels or is a ship repair firm that can demonstrate those qualifications. 
*Note:  Contract N00024-10-C-2204 was initially awarded for the procurement of FOA/PSA for LPD 21 and LPD 25.
  Subsequently, homeport assignments for LPD 24 and LPD 25 have been changed.  LPD 25 is now a West coast ship and LPD 24 is now an East coast ship.  As a result, Contract N00024-10-C-2204 will provide FOA/PSA for East coast ships, LPD 21 and LPD 24.  FOA/PSA for LPD 25 is currently being synopsized as an option under solicitation N00024-10-R-2400.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

MARKET RRESEARCH
Determination & findings

Market Survey

2237 request number 675-11-1-804-0002 was received in Tampa Contracting Office (SAO East 8 Services Team) to establish service contract for one base year with four (1) one year options. This contract will be established to provide a stable living environment to house homeless veterans, including substance abuse/mental health treatment, physical, emotional and spiritual needs. 

 A search of the Federal Supply Schedule and GSA revealed this item is not available under contract.  A search of VETBIZ revealed there are no Service Disabled, Hub Zone, Women Owned Small Business, or Service Disabled owned Businesses under NAICS code 624221 (homeless shelters) or NAICS 624229 (Transitional housing agencies) located in Florida to provide these services.

 Market research found a local area set aside is needed to facilitate transportation requirements; in accordance with the statement of work the contractor's facility shall be located in an area which is accessible to local transportation and at a reasonable distance to the Orlando VAMC. Research yielded three facilities located in the Orlando metropolitan area with NAICS code 624229 (temporary shelters) and NAICS code 624191 (family shelter).   

Market research performed by social work office in Orlando found that there are facilities capable of supplying the required service and that are located within the local catchment area.

Determination

In accordance with FAR 10.001, market research was conducted. In accordance with FAR 6.102 full and open competition will be pursued with all qualified facilities that meet the Government requirements through use of competitive procedure(s). Full and Open Competition has been determined to be best suited to the circumstances of this contract action and consistent with the need to fulfill the Government's requirements efficiently. The solicitation will be posted on FBO. Contract award could be made to more than one capable Vendor. 

The above statements are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY<BR>AN/PVS-7( ) and AN/PVS-14 Helmet Mount Assembly<BR> <BR>Background<BR><BR>This is a Market Survey to locate sources for the AN/PVS-7( ) and AN/PVS-14 Helmet Mount Assembly. The Government is considering a Request for Proposal (RFP) for procurement of the Helmet Mount Assembly, herein identified as the HMA.  The HMA is a mechanical device that attaches the AN/PVS-7B, AN/PVS-7D and AN/PVS 14 Night Vision Device (NVD) systems to the Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) helmet, Combat Vehicle Crewman (CVC) helmet and the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH). The HMA consists of two major components; a Front Bracket and Mount. The Front Bracket hooks onto the front edge of the helmet and is fastened directly to the helmet using the existing mounting aperture and ballistics hardware. The Mount clips into the Front Bracket, attaches to and supports the NVD system, and provides for adjustments to the system position.  Description<BR><BR>The HMA shall attach securely to the PASGT, ACH and CVC helmets with a camouflage cover installed without affecting the protective qualities of the helmet. The HMA shall utilize or be backwards compatible with the currently fielded Front Brackets (Government drawings A3256371 and A3297307). The HMA shall accept the AN/PVS-7B, -7D and -14 NVD systems (including Headset Adapter, NSN 5965-01-444-1216). The HMA shall hold the NVD securely in place during normal operation and make the system free for release with one hand when the systems release latch is activated. Removal of a system using the system latch while the system is operating shall cause the NVD system to shut off. The HMA shall include adjustments for quick helmet release, flip-up (out of sight)/flip-down (system operation), line-of-sight tilt (above and below horizontal), fore-aft eye relief distance and to center the eyepiece optical axis with the viewing eye (horizontal and vertical adjustment or equivalent). The flip-up/flip-down mechanism shall not require the user to push, pull or twist any button, lever or knob. Each mechanical adjustment shall consist of a single control and be designed for one-handed operation. When the AN/PVS-7B, -7D, or -14 system is installed in the helmet mount and operating, flipping the assembly up from the system operation position to the out of sight position shall cause the system to automatically shut off.   <BR>Acquisition <BR><BR>The anticipated acquisition strategy for the award is as follows: [1] Full and open competition; [2] It is the Governments intention to make one award; however, additional awards may be considered; and [3] Contract will be a three (3) year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract. The minimum quantity is anticipated to be approximately 5000 HMAs per month. This is not an RFP and no award will be made from this sources sought notice. Suppliers interested in the ID/IQ contract are encouraged to monitor the U.S. Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) for further program information.<BR><BR>Responses<BR><BR>Desired information includes company name, address, point of contact and phone number, and technical literature or descriptive information concerning your product. Website URL is acceptable. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. This is a sources sought notice only.  Information obtained through this sources sought announcement will be utilized for planning purposes only.  Documentation provided will not be returned.

<SOLNBR>CP-10-12-10-02
<RESPDATE>111210
<CONTACT>Stephanie Blake, Phone 571-226-4620 , Fax 703-208-7326, Email sblake@nish.org
<DESC>On behalf of The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee), the independent Federal agency that administers the AbilityOne Program, NISH, a designated central nonprofit is pursuing a potential partnerships with commercial manufacturers of Salad Oils (Canola and Soy) for the purpose of providing employment opportunities for people who are blind or severely disabled. If successful, the result will be a Co-Branding Agreement between the manufacturer and the AbilityOne Program, and its registered brands. The ultimate expectation is that the co-branded product will be placed on the Committee's Procurement List (PL).
<p>The manufacturers will be nationally (or regionally) recognized suppliers of edible oils and will supply two NISH Food Producing Non-profit Agencies, located in Rochester, NY (Salad Oil, Canola) and Cookeville, TN (Salad Oil, Soy) who will package, pack, label, mark, unitize and distribute 100% of the annual requirement of these oils to all four branches of the U.S. Military and other Federal Customers, through the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Prime Vendor Program. The Non-profit Agencies will provide world-wide distribution to CONUS and OCONUS locations.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the following criteria must be met (proposals must address all criteria):</p>
<p>1. Possession of a nationally (or regionally) known brand name that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales.<br /><br />2. U.S. manufacturer of commercial-off-the-shelf Salad Oil (Canola and Soy). These oils include Soybean, Winterized Soybean, and Canola (Rapeseed). Future oils may include but are not limited to corn, cottonseed, peanut, and sesame oils (additional, future oils types are not guaranteed). Interested manufacturers do not need to supply all oil types. Therefore, multiple manufacturers may be selected. However, preference may be given to manufacturers of all oil types (Canola and Soy).</p>
<p>3. The Salad Oils must meet and/or exceed Federal Government and Industry published standards.</p>
<p>4. The chosen manufacturers must be willing to set a high priority for delivering the oils to two NISH Food producing Non-profit Agencies in order to assure on-time deliveries to the U.S. Military through the DLA Troop Support Prime Vendor Program. In the event of Surge or Full Scale Mobilization, the oil suppliers must be willing to provide up to 300% of the annual requirement of 40,000 Cases of Salad Oil, Canola and 13,000 Cases of Salad Oil, Soy. Canola oils will be delivered to Rochester, NY. Soy oils will be delivered to Cookeville, TN.</p>
<p>5. A Certificate of Conformance must be provided for all in-bound oils.</p>
<p>6. A willingness to enter into a multi-year agreement which includes on-going technical and production assistance and the necessary factory trained technical field support while enabling the Non-profit Agencies to meet the criteria of the AbilityOne Program to package, pack, label, mark, unitize and distribute the products to the U.S. Military and other Federal Customers, thereby creating employment for people who are blind or severely disabled.</p>
<p>7. Commitment to working independently with the Non-profit Agencies to market products to the Government customers under the AbilityOne Program. Preference may be given to manufactures that have a dedicated team for Federal Government Sales and Marketing.</p>
<p>8. Willingness to work with the NISH Non-profit Agencies selected for this Addition and the Committee to ensure that the price to the end-users is a fair and reasonable. Pricing will negotiated on a quarterly basis with DLA Troop Support and will be derived from the New York Board of Trade or appropriate market indicator.</p>
<p>9. Manufacturers' submissions must demonstrate that proposed products meet the various criteria noted.</p>
<p>10. Geographic location: Preference may be given to a Co-Branding Partner that is strategically located in close proximity to the aforementioned cities, as the Non-profit Agencies may be interested in a Cooperative Arrangement with Industry (CAI). A CAI is an arrangement between a Nonprofit Agency and a commercial firm when a Nonprofit Agency utilizes a commercial firm's plant, equipment or personnel in the production of a commodity under the AbilityOne Program. Any cooperative arrangement with a commercial firm must effectively set apart the Nonprofit's activities and operations at the commercial plant/location so as to create clear guidelines for use of leased commercial facilities and services, which are under the Nonprofit's complete control and direction. In this case, the Nonprofit Agency will have leased facilities for the total control of the line to complete one or more of following production tasks for the salad oils: packaging, packing, labeling, marking, unitizing, and/or distributing. The resulting arrangement is captured in a Cooperative Agreement with Industry (developed and approved in compliance with Committee's Operations Memorandum 21-www.abilityone.gov&#61664;Policy-Plans).</p>
<p>11. Past performance: Manufacturers with past experience in state or federal Government sales of salad oils may be given preference.</p>
<p>12. Manufacturer's proposals shall include their requirements for the nonprofit agency such as quality systems/certifications, inspection of the NPA premises, proprietary information/non-disclosure agreements; defect liability; product recall; etc. Additionally, it is expected that the Non-profit Agencies will be subject to a comprehensive Quality Audit by the selected supplier, to ensure they meet the standards of the Co-Branding Partner. Proposals should outline the requirements of the Quality Audit. Additionally, if there are areas that do not meet the standards of the Co-Branding Partner, it will be the responsibility of the supplier to work with the Non-profit Agency to meet those quality requirements.</p>
<p><br />The deadline for response is November 12. 2010.</p>
<p>Responses should be directed to the contact listed in this Notice. The preferred method of submission is via email to Stephanie Blake. Responses, if submitted via email, should be limited to 10MB or less. There is no limit if submitted to the physical street address.</p>
<p>Questions should be directed to Stephanie Blake at sblake@nish.org or 571-226-4620.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.002(b)(2)(i) this notice is issued for the purpose of market research. This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for (IFB) nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request or will award a contract or proceed with any of the above solicitations in the near future. Based on capability statements received from this announcement, this acquisition may be solicited as a Simplified Acquisition Procedure using a Request for Quotation in FY-2011.</p>
<p>The Broadcasting Board of Governors is seeking capability statements from potential sources capable of providing services as identified herein. These services are for finding all republications of Voice of America (VOA) Content in Russian, Mandarin, Spanish and French languages on major websites and blogs, and most republications on the rest of the web, whether VOA is credited or not.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to determine republications of VOA content, increase potential number of affiliations, and increase search engine presence of VOA content through Search Engine Optimization (SEO) link-building.</p>
<p>Deliverable required: <br />&bull; List of all republishing sites, including link to republication, date found, and reference to text republished, in a timely manner (for 1 week after original article publication) in Russian, Mandarin, Spanish and French languages.</p>
<p>Example: <br />10% of article "How the west was won" [link to VOA article]<br />Republished on Inosmi.ru [link to republished article]<br />VOA's content is 50% of republished article<br />Found on June 4, 2010. <br />Text republished/found: "The west was won with fighting and bloodshed. Lots of horses and buggies were also involved." <br />This reference did not credit VOA.<br />This reference did not link to VOA.</p>
<p>Where:<br />&bull; Locate all republished content on top 300 websites in target countries (according to ComScore's monthly rankings where available, or from lists provided by VOA). <br />&bull; Successfully locate republications on websites not included in 300 top websites.</p>
<p>Content Matched:<br />&bull; Locate republications based on exact text string matches from VOA articles, not topics or keywords related to VOA content. Ignore publications similar to VOA content without being exact reprints (partial or complete).<br />&bull; Locate articles that have been completely republished.<br />&bull; Locate any portion of an article republished, what percentage of the VOA article was republished and what percentage of the republished article is VOA content.<br />&bull; Locate articles by VOA journalists, bloggers and other contributors by name and affiliation to VOA.</p>
<p>Process:<br />&bull; Must be automated - VOA can create RSS feeds, but cannot manually submit content for republication search.<br />&bull; Weekly meeting with vendor until system is deemed satisfactorily configured. If needed, technical teams from vendor and IBB/VOA meet and collaborate to problem solve. <br />Required data for each republication found: <br />&bull; Specify whether article a) links to and credits VOA, b) credits VOA, or c) does not credit or link to VOA.<br />&bull; Date found<br />&bull; Text found<br />&bull; Percentage of VOA's article found<br />&bull; Percentage of found article that uses VOA's content<br />&bull; Link to republication<br />&bull; Site where republication occurred</p>
<p>Must be able to look at reports by site of republication, and by article republished:</p>
<p>Example: <br />By site republished: <br />Inosmi - 5 articles found<br />*How the west was won<br />*The sky is blue<br />*There was an election<br />*There was an earthquake<br />*News is usually exciting like that</p>
<p>By Article republished:<br />How the West was won (voanews.com/news/how-the-west-was-won.html) - 4 republications<br />*Inosmi.ru<br />*Mail.ru<br />*Someonesblog.ru<br />*Someoneelsesblog.com</p>
<p>Deliverable format: All republication citations must be exportable in .csv format with all meta-data listed above.</p>
<p>The BBG will determine whether services are being provided by:</p>
<p>&bull;Controlled test: Work with vendor to set up a test feed on 10 known republishing sites in target country/countries. After 3 weeks, compare identified articles to manually found articles to determine what is being picked up and what isn't. Accuracy rate must be 80-85% during controlled test period.</p>
<p>&bull;Weekly spot-check of 10-20 articles by language, to ascertain whether they are being picked up by vendor. Accuracy rate must be 90-95% by language each week.</p>
<p>&bull;Weekly meeting with vendor until system is deemed satisfactorily configured.</p>
<p>Potential sources shall have the capability to perform the above-listed services and should submit their written capability statements by 2:00 pm on November 1, 2010, to the Contracting Officer at the following email address: Brenda Dade at bdade@bbg.gov and Cherylynn Peters at cpeters@bbg.gov.

<p>The requirement is not only for complete turnkey solutions, but rather to define and meet the evolving requirements of the project. Therefore, responses from companies that can meet these requirements are encouraged.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">In the 1960's, SSA began using ALC as an alternative to COBOL since COBOL had much less functionality at the time. ALC was needed to overcome these deficiencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ALC is a low-level language used on IBM mainframes from the earliest 360 series, through systems 370, 390 and z/Series, as well as the Univac 90/60, 90/70 and 90/80 mainframes. ALC resides on the SSA mainframe and is included in the common code libraries. This language is used in many of our applications. Additionally, some of our other software applications call it. ENDEVOR is the system used to manage and store many of our software languages.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="COLOR: black"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">SSA wants to convert its ALC code to COBOL because it is easier to code. Therefore, more of our personnel are capable of learning and supporting it. SSA has successfully converted 5,000 of its lines of ALC code to COBOL by using three ALC programmer experts. These lines of code were converted within a 6-month timeframe. There are approximately 1.5 million lines of code left to convert. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">SSA has several software applications that uses ALC. Below is an example of some of the ALC modules found in SSA:</span></p>

The project will involve renovating approximately 12,000 square feet of primarily vacant space.  Work will include asbestos abatement, some demolition, new walls, plumbing, HVAC, electrical, communications and other work necessary for a complete and functional dialysis unit.  The 6th floor will have special water requirements for Dialysis.  A Reverse Osmosis (RO) system and Dialyzing Acid system will be required.  Existing Dialysis units are portable and will be relocated and used in the new area.

<DESC>I. Description
<p>The USAF Air Armament Center Intra Theater/Close Control Strike IPT Capabilities Planning and Development Division (AAC/XRS) is requesting information on viable concepts related to campaign level modeling of Irregular Warfare (IW) and Close Air Support (CAS) which will assist Air Force decision makers in evaluating existing, modified, and new concept air delivered weapons for potential use given cost, effectiveness, platform loadout, and logistical constraints within realistic, long duration IW/CAS theater scenarios.</p>
<p>II. Technical Objectives</p>
<p>Armed overwatch and persistent armed ISR, with both manned and unmanned aerial systems (UAS), have become the preferred method of operation in today's IW/CAS environments in order to effectively deal with time sensitive target scenarios that randomly occur in time, location, and type. Current conventional air delivered weapon campaign modeling tools are not tailored for these types of dynamic and random scenarios.</p>
<p>To realistically assess optimal weapon types during armed overwatch and persistent armed ISR for IW/CAS campaigns, the following elements need to be addressed (see attached slide for a "visual" of the process):</p>
<p>1. Develop a realistic and warfighter credible armed overwatch/persistent armed ISR air order of battle. This may entail assessing operational history and CONOPS of current IW missions (CAS and armed ISR) to develop the proper allocation of air assets in space and time within campaign modeling efforts.</p>
<p>2. Develop realistic and warfighter credible target scenario generation. Occurrence of IW/CAS targets during the campaign is assumed to be dynamic and random in time, location, and type. Targets can be time sensitive (valid for a limited time) and occur at frequencies and surges consistent with historically credible rates for current IW operations. Appropriate and warfighter credible Rules Of Engagement (ROE) restrictions commensurate with target type and scenarios are critically important and should be tagged to specific targets as they are generated.</p>
<p>3. Given an armed overwatch/persistent armed ISR air order of battle coupled with dynamic and random target scenario generation (including restrictive ROE) for the IW/CAS campaign, generate effectiveness results given specific weapon loadouts for the various platform types used in the campaign (manned and UAS). This includes the intelligent matching of available air assets to specific targets. The ability to analyze the impacts on resources such as number of sorties and number of weapons used is needed. Event based modeling is assumed necessary because of the time dependent nature of the analysis. <br />&emsp;</p>
<p>4. Analyze campaign effectiveness results to determine optimal weapon types and aircraft loadouts. This should include assessing the efficiency of air asset utilization and the reduction in kill chain timeline necessary to defeat IW/CAS targets. The impact on logistics should also be assessed.</p>

<DESC>Intent to Announce Request for Project Proposals (RPP) Under Robotics OTA
Description: Standoff Dismounted Explosive Hazards Detection and Marking
This is not a Request for Project Proposals nor a Request for Information, but for planning purposes only. A project award will not be awarded from this announcement. The Government intends to announce a Request for Project Proposals for execution of an award in support of a Ground Robotics related research area. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of the Robotics Technology Consortium, and industry in general, advanced notification of Government intent. In December 2007, the Government announced its intent to enter into an Other Transaction Agreement with one (1) consortium in support of Ground Robotics related Research and Development projects. As a result of the Ground Robotics Industry Day in January 2008, one (1) consortium formed, the Robotics Technology Consortium. It is the intent of the Government to make project award(s) to the members of the Robotics Technology Consortium as a result of member project proposals submitted via the Request for Project Proposals. 
The following is a synopsis of the anticipated Research Area for which project proposals will be sought: 
The Government anticipates seeking information regarding the capability to provide standoff dismounted explosive hazards detection, marking and neutralization in off-road, complex terrain.  This solution would be focused on addressing the ever-increasing threat that is posed by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and other explosive hazard threats in many different forms and situations (including those being encountered in operations currently underway in Iraq and Afghanistan.)  The sought-after capabilities to be contained within proposals submitted in response to the upcoming RPP would be explosive hazards detection and marking integrated onto a Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) platform.
The Request for Project Proposals (W15QKN-08-9-0001-RPP8) will be issued to the Robotics Technology Consortiums Administrative Agent, the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, who will then issue the request to the members of the Consortium. For information on the Robotics Technology Consortium and/or how to become a member, visit the following website: http://www.roboticstechc.org/.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-00-NIB-1013<br />Name: Steno notebook, Gregg ruled, 6x9", 80 Sheets<br />Description: Steno Book, 100% PCW Recycled, 6" x 9", Gregg ruled, eye-ease green paper, Faint red center rule, 80 pages</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-00-NIB-1012<br />Name: Steno notebook, Gregg ruled, 6x9", 60 Sheets<br />Description: Steno Book, 100% PCW Recycled, 6" x 9", Gregg ruled, eye-ease green paper, Faint red center rule, 60 pages</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be GSA/Federal Supply Service, New York, NY<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-00-NIB-1013<br />Similar Items: RED36746, UNV86920, AMP25274, AMP25474, SPRG69, UNV76920</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-00-NIB-1012<br />Similar Items: SPR01407, UNV76620, AMP25270, TOP8001, RED36646</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than October 26 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.

<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than October 26, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

<DESC>Advanced EOD Robotic System Draft Documentation Package

All interested parties are invited to request the Advanced Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robotic System (AEODRS) draft documentation package which will be available on or about December 15, 2010. The AEODRS is anticipated to be a family of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) that will be used by Joint Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) forces to counter the threat posed by improvised explosive devices (IED) and unexploded ordnance (UXO). The AEODRS family of UGVs is expected to consist of a dismounted operations variant, a tactical variant, and a base/infrastructure operations variant that share a common logical, electrical, and physical architecture and that are all controlled by a common operator control unit (OCU).
  The draft documentation package will describe the common architecture being used across the family and include performance specifications for the dismounted operations variant.  The draft documentation package is being made available as part of continued communication with industry, academia, and other Government agencies regarding the AEODRS program.  Requesters should note that the documentation package will be in draft form and is subject to change after the release without notice.  The Government anticipates future releases of the documentation package which will be announced separately.  To request the draft documentation package provide your name, company/organization name, address, telephone number, and email address to Melody Harvey, e-mail melody.harvey@navy.mil, no later than December 1, 2010.

This announcement is for information only, does not constitute an invitation for bid or Request for Proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a contract or order.
  Requesting the draft documentation package is not a prerequisite for ultimately submitting any future proposals.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in making the request or any effort expended after receipt of the package.  Instructions for providing comments to the Government regarding the draft documentation package will be included with the release.

Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!!

Vendors are invited to provide a proposal for each CLIN 0001-0010. If applicable, similarly priced courses will be combined into one SUBCLIN Item to allow the MCTC the flexibility to select the courses from within that price range. Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR).  Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.  The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be Best Value to the Government.

Pursuant to FAR 9.104-4, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to request adequate evidence of responsibility on the part of any prospective subcontractor (s). In the absence of information clearly indicating that the prospective contractor is responsible, the contracting officer shall make a determination of non-responsibility. As a minimum requirement, all offerors must submit, as part of the original proposal, the following: (1) Companys Financial Statement which includes Balance Sheet and Income Statement; and (2) Point Of Contact from their Bank or any financial institution with which they transact business, Contractor Access to Federally Controlled Facilities and/or Unclassified Sensitive Information or Unclassified IT Systems (May 2010), Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.
  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006  DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive  12 (HSPD-12) dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.  This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform certain unclassified both non-sensitive and sensitive duties.  It is the responsibility of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. The requirement to control access to sensitive information applies to all US government IT systems and/or areas where unclassified but sensitive information may be discussed, displayed or maintained.
  DON policy prescribes that all unclassified data that has not been approved for public release and is stored on mobile computing devises must be treated as sensitive data and encrypted using commercially available encryption technology. Whenever granted access to sensitive information, contractor employees shall follow applicable DoD/DoN instructions, regulations, policies and procedures when reviewing, processing, producing, protecting, destroying and/or storing that information.  Operational Security (OPSEC) procedures and practices must be implemented by both the contractor and contract employee to protect the product, information, services, operations and missions related to the contract.
 The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractors Security Representative.  Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the Navy Commands Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractors Security Representative.  The Contractors Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter.  The Contractors Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer. Non-Sensitive Positions, Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements: Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the US (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and, Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check prior to installation access.
 To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractors Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following: SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards, Original Signed Release Statements. The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed NACI. The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date. Sensitive Positions, Contractor employee whose duties require accessing a DoD unclassified computer/network, working with sensitive unclassified information (either at a Government or contractor facility), or physical access to a DoD facility must be a US citizen and possess a favorable trustworthiness determination prior to installation access.
  To obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination, each contractor employee must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC) which consists of a NACI including a FBI fingerprint check plus credit and law enforcement checks. Each contractor employee applying for a trustworthiness determination is required to complete: SF-85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards Original Signed Release Statements, Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.  To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access a DoD unclassified computer/network, and/or have access to sensitive unclassified information, the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. IT Systems Access, When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employees duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Commands Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individuals performance under the contract.  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.
  The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Commands Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.  When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractors Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required. Security Approval Process, The Contractors Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Commands Security Manager.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Commands Security Manager.  Forms and fingerprint cards may be obtained from the Navy Commands Security Manager.  These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employees anticipated date for reporting for duty.  The Navy Commands Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy Commands Security Manager may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment.
  A favorable review of the questionnaire and advance fingerprint results are required as an interim measure prior to the contract employee start date.  An unfavorable determination made by the Navy Commands Security Manager is final and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Commands Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR.  The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employees performance under the contract.
 The Navy Commands Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing.  Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a position of trust determination.  When a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees shall not be permitted to work on this contract effort and if already working on the contract shall be removed immediately. The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of access for a proposed contractor employee who fails to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.
  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees for working in non-sensitive positions, with sensitive information, and/or on Government IT systems. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information. All quotes shall include the requested item, with its unit prices, extended prices, and total price, a point of contact, name and telephone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, prompt payment terms. Quote over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br /><br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>

<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>

The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include but is not limited to Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year, with four one-year options</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG).

<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor.

<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include but is not limited to Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>Activation of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Advisor will be coordinated with OFDA/TAG. USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a WASH Advisor to provide expert technical advice and assistance for the analysis of risks to water, sanitation and hygiene in a disaster setting and subsequent potential risks to populations. This person will also be expected to provide expert advice on disaster response and risk reduction strategies for WASH disasters activities worldwide.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NRMAG00-11-DG.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30.</p>
<p>(IV) This procurement will be set aside for small business if qualified responses are received. The associated NAICS code is 541690. The small business size standard is $7 million.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services:<br /><br />Develop software, written in IDL (version 8.0 is preferable), with user-configurable code functionality via user-specified variable input control parameters.</p>
<p>Raw data will be High Definition Video frames recorded with a consumer (as opposed to professional) camcorder such as, but not limited to, a Panasonic HDC-TM700K. Recording will be 1080p Progressive Recording (corresponding to a minimum resolvable hydrometeor size of approximately 0.15 mm). The camcorder is suspended about 33 meters below a balloon that flies through storms. A video frame may contain an image of hydrometeor(s) that is obtained with a 1/8000 of a second shutter speed. Software must be able to digitally detect and track individual, illuminated particles against dark background of the particle imaging chamber, and obtain various derived characteristics of individual particles and particle size distributions.</p>
<p>(VI) Software must meet the following requirements:<br />1) Software must be written in IDL as fully documented source code with instructions for use by a person unfamiliar with IDL, including instruction prompts. Documentation must include in-code commenting of significant tasks/functions/routines and a separate, searchable PDF-format Users Manual with step-by-step guidance.</p>
<p>2) Provide a quick-look data perusal capability of individually selected video frames for qualitative assessment of data. The quick look should provide users a convenient capability to skip a selected number of frames, which will allow users to step through the data from a flight. The step-through capability must include single frame, both forward and backward.</p>
<p>3) Automatically load sequence of individual frames from the video camera or other common storage media.</p>
<p>4) For each frame, automatically identify/position and determine the number of particles. Automatically classify the basic shape, such as round, horizontally extended ellipsoid, irregular, indeterminate, particle aspect ratio, etc., of each particle. Software fits appropriate shape models (e.g., circle, ellipse, etc) to estimate shape and relevant parameters as well as statistical deviation from fitted model(s).</p>
<p>5) Automatic calculation of oblateness (i.e., fit oblate-spheroidal model for drop at terminal fallspeed) for drop habit.</p>
<p>6) Produce summary information for the hydrometers, including the number of particles having each basic shape within each specified range of particle sizes in adjacent size bins that can be defined and changed by the end user. Allow optional bin spacing with user-specifiable number of bins (1-100): (1) linear (i.e., input constant bin spacing/number); (2) logarithmic (i.e., input smallest bin width/stretch factor/number). Provide a convenient ability for users to (1) specify the length of time to be included in each summary, (2) specify a start and stop time, or alternatively a start time and length of time, for which a series of summaries will be produced, and (3) automatically process video frames spanning the specified time period to produce and write out in ASCII readable form a series of summaries, each having the specified length of time. Each summary should specify the start time, stop time, and the length of time for which the summary was produced.</p>
<p>7) Produce histograms (i.e., both for total particles and for individual habits) of particle concentration in units of number per unit volume per unit diameter/radius interval. Software must estimate sampling volume derived from product of image width x depth x number of images x image height (i.e., swept out by ground-relative vertical motion of videosonde). (At 30 fps frame rate and approximately 5 m/s balloon rise rate, individual images are non-overlapping and therefore simply summed to obtain desired number of total particles.)</p>
<p>8) Data from balloon-borne GPS tracking will be available. Software needs to integrate the tracking and timing information to indicate the instantaneous location and time of images, as well as the start and stop location and distance spanned for each summary period or the period/mean height/mean temperature/layer thickness corresponding to each histogram. Header record that includes time and GPS-determined location should be attached to image and derived particle attribute (e.g., counts, sizes, oblateness, histograms, etc.) files output by the software. Additional code is desired to report individually or by statistical distributions within each summary period defined as above whether hydrometeors are liquid or frozen for each size range indicated by the summary.</p>
<p>Any proposals not meeting the specified requirements must include information as to why different approach is proposed, and why it would be better.</p>
<p>(VII) Delivery of all code, instructions, etc., within 120 calendar days after receipt of contract.</p>
<p>(VIII) NSSL has 30 days to determine if the delivered software, users manual, etc. fulfill the requirements. Contractor then has 10 business days to submit modified documents.</p>
<p>(IX) Provide evidence of contractor's expertise related to requirements of solicitation, specifically:<br />List and provide description of IDL-based image-processing software you have written<br />List and provide brief description of IDL programs (i.e., other than image-processing) you have written<br />List and provide description of relevant IDL program(s) you have written</p>
<p>(X) Place of performance is the National Severe Storms Laboratory, 120 David L Boren Blvd., Norman, OK 73072.<br /><br />(XI) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (June 2008), applies to this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to reiterate information from the initialannouncement as well as the previous amendments and to provide additional information regarding what the Government is seeking in terms of a submission.
This is NOT a Request For Proposal (RFP) nor a Request for Quote (RFQ).  As stated in the original notice, the U.S. Army is contemplating award of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).  
If you are a small business and you have received a copy of the TDP, you may submit a capabilities statement for your company.  Even if this TDP does not directly apply to your company, but the notice indicated work that your company produces (i.e. plastics, composite) you may respond, as long as you received the TDP. 
The Government will NOT evaluate Proposals or Quotes as that is not what this notice calls for.  There is no standard format for the capabilities statement; however, it should provide a background on your company and your ability to perform this work in general terms.
There are no SPECIFIC quantities as this is for a BPA.  Specific details are not provided and are not being requested as this is for a basic BPA. 
Additionally, there will be NO extension.  As previously stated, capabilities statements are due 25 October 2010 at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

<DESC><p>SUBJECT: Technical, Business, Records Management, Information Technology, and Property Management Support Services to the Department of Energy Office of Legacy Management</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS:</p>
<p>This announcement serves as a Sources Sought synopsis issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. This Sources Sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation nor is this notice a request for quotation. The Department is NOT requesting a quote or proposal in response to this synopsis. For the purpose of this acquisition, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 562910 - Environmental Remediation Services and the applicable size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The DOE Office of Legacy Management's (LM) primary mission is to manage the DOE's post-closure responsibilities and to ensure the future protection of human health and the environment. The DOE is issuing this synopsis to identify firms having an interest in providing support services to the DOE Office of LM to include: Technical Support; Business Support; Records Management Support; Information Technology Support; and Property Management Support.</p>
<p>Specifically, this requirement is to provide (1) integrated support to the entire LM professional workforce that is dispersed at various physical locations where the work is being conducted, including environmental, beneficial reuse of property, policy, planning, budget and integration, administration and records and information managers and staff; (2) utilize both on-site and off-site contractor personnel to effectively accomplish the work in an integrated smooth and seamless manner over the breadth of LM locations; (3) conduct complex tasks that support multiple organizational goals and service areas. Since the LM federal staff is not co-located at a single site, these tasks are anticipated to require a great deal of integration and synthesis of information and work flow; (4) consist of predictable, longer-term tasks (under core work) with generally defined end objectives, but composed of smaller serial subtasks (with more defined objectives) that complement federal performance objectives such as the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements; (5) provide for shorter-term tasks (under variable work) requiring unique and/or specialized resources and facilities to address specific LM program and project issues.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. Interested sources shall submit a tailored capability statement that demonstrates the expertise, personnel, protocols, systems, and technology to meet requirements of the draft SOW. Tailored Capability Statements shall demonstrate a clear understanding of all tasks specified in the draft SOW. Prospective firms are requested to submit a capability statement that (1) identifies the prospective contractor (business name, business size (large, small, 8(a), etc.), point of contract (including email address), telephone number, and identify the nature of the proposing entity (e.g., joint venture, limited liability corporation, etc.); (2) describes the prospective contractor's capabilities, relevant experience and corporate resources to perform a contract of the size and complexity of which is the subject of this requirement; (3) includes potential teaming partners or potential subcontractors and information delineated in item 2 relative to the prospective partner/subcontractor experience and capabilities; and (4) may include comments on the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). Interested firms are requested to submit a capability statement, limited to no more than 20 pages, no later than November 8, 2010 at 8:00 P.M. EST. The responding party must possess a facility security clearance and comply with the DOE Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) program. This request for capability statement does not constitute a request for proposals. Submission of any information in response to the market survey is purely voluntary. The government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract. A solicitation is tentatively scheduled to be issued in the 2nd quarter of CY 2011.</p>
<p>This is intended to be a competitive acquisition under NAICS Code 562910, Remediation Services, with a size standard of 500 employees. A determination on Small Business set-aside is pending. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Bid, nor does it restrict the government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the government for any purpose.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to the solicitation notice is to upload the solicitation and related documents to request proposals by the cut-off date listed herein.<br /><br /><br />Synopsis:
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a requirement to explore the predictive validity of Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC) program tests. NHTSA's Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) directs a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting the development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors. Research areas include: alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints, speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers, driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services, and emergency medical services. The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations. Examples of these studies can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Research investigating the impairing effects of various drugs on a driver's ability to safely operate his/her car has not been definitive. Tests used to assess impairment from drug use are usually developed for the specific study in which they are used, and are, in many cases, unstandardized. Those tests used more widely, especially by law enforcement officers, have not been specifically validated to determine impairment based on drug use (other than those that have been thusfar standardized for determining recent alcohol use). Law enforcement officers who are certified as Drug Recognition Experts (DREs) are trained to utilize a variety of readily observable signs and symptoms that are accepted in the medical community as reliable indicators of drug influence. The program enables officers to determine whether a suspect is under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs; and if so, the DRE combines basic medical knowledge about drug pharmacodynamics with the administration of psychomotor tests to determine the category of drugs. This form of training is costly in time (it is a 9-day course) and resources.</p>
<p>During an evaluation, the DRE collects information on the suspects's current condition, a brief medical history, and also assesses the suspect's pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, pupil size and reaction to light, and psychomotor function. The DRE also examines the suspect's visual tracking, visual convergence, smooth pursuit and Horizontal and Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (HGN and VGN, respectively). This information is documented consistently on a form, the Drug Influence Evaluation (DIE) "Face Sheet", by all DREs. Using the DIE, the DRE captures about 60 different elements, in numerical, pictorial and narrative form. The DRE also summarizes his or her observations in a narrative statement. Based on the information gathered, the DRE determines whether the subject is under the influence of drugs, the specific category of drugs, and requests that the suspect provide a biological specimen for confirmation.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>There has been no systematic investigation of whether it is necessary for the DREs to collect all of the information or whether a core set of the measures are more directly relevant. Therefore, the OBSR is interested in conducting a study to collect and code all the information found on a large sample of DIE data sheets to determine which combination(s) elements coalesce to predict the toxicology-confirmed results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The objectives of this study are to:<br />(a) gather a sample of DIE Face Sheets from several Law Enforcement Agencies that participate in the DEC Program along with the corresponding toxicological test results based on blood samples;<br />(b) code the numerical, pictorial, and narrative information found on the data sheets and the confirmation results, and create a database of measures from the sample;<br />(c) determine accuracy of the DRE opinions using the corresponding toxicological confirmation results; and<br />(d) analyze the data to identify of groups of interrelated variables to see how they are correlated to each other and the drug class confirmed by blood samples.</p>
<p><br />Solicitation Information:</p>
<p>The Government contemplates that a Time and Material type Contract with a period of performance not to exceed eighteen (18) months will be awarded. The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at https://www.fedbizopps.gov referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22-10-R-00376). The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about May 7, 2010. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</p>
<p>NO FURTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVALABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

<SUBJECT>Global Antiterrorism Training Assistance (GATA)
<SOLNBR>SAQMMA09R0356
<CONTACT>William T. Schaeffer, Contract Specialist, Phone 5712269619, Email schaefferwt@state.gov
<DESC>Synopsis: The Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, is looking for sources to provide training facilities and qualified instructor personnel in support of the Office of Anti Terrorism Assistance. The US Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Training Directorate, Office of Antiterrorism Assistance (DS/T/ATA) manages the antiterrorism assistance program. ATA assists foreign partners to develop the capability for antiterrorism planning and coordination and commitment to support US counterterrorism objectives. This includes coordinating, synchronizing, implementing and expanding training and technical assistance programs; sharing technology with foreign partners; establishing or strengthening alliances and/or agreements, regional partnerships, and security assistance programs; promoting interagency cooperation among foreign government security and law enforcement forces; and supporting exchange programs. The program&rsquo;s geographic reach is extensive, having trained over 61,000 foreign police and civilian security officials in over 152 countries since inception in 1983. Country assistance plans are implemented through advanced training, technical assistance, and equipment grants including computers and software. Capacity building projects are tailored to the needs of each Partner Nation. DS/T/ATA requires contractor support for ATA&rsquo;s specialized foreign assistance mission. This contract will support the ATA office in conducting foreign law enforcement training and related activities, both domestic and overseas. A solicitation will be issued to select multiple ( two) prime contractors. Contractors must be US companies based in the United States. Contractor will provide overseas and domestic instructor-led training; specialized and advanced technical assistance; domestic training facilities; and training-related support services. This contract is unclassified. No facilities security clearances or personal security clearances are required. While no personal security clearances are required, instructor personnel will require some type of vetting which we expect will be short of what is required for a moderate risk, public trust determination. ATA has a course portfolio of approximately 50 courses with 325 scheduled events each year. During any given week, ATA can be conducting 10-20 courses worldwide. Approximately 85 percent of the courses are taught overseas. The remaining courses are taught domestically and will require training and support facilities within the 48 contiguous States. DS anticipates release of a finalized RFP in December 2009 and contract award by the end of March 2010. **** NOTE: The anticipated release date for the finalized RFP has been delayed. The new release date is expected on or before March 15, 2010 and contract award date is expected on or before June 15, 2010. ****<br /><br />** SOLICITATION AMENDMENT 10/12/2010 - EXPIRATION DATE EXTENSION **<br /><br />DUE TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THE REVIEW OF THE SUBMITTED PROPOSALS HAS BEEN DELAYED.&nbsp; IT IS REQUESTED THAT ALL&nbsp;VENDORS WHO SUBMITTED PROPOSALS EXTEND THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THEIR PROPOSAL TO JANUARY 15, 2011.&nbsp; PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR RESPONSES TO THE REQUEST FOR EXPIRATION DATE EXTENSION TO WILLIAM SCHAEFFER VIA EMAIL (<a href="mailto:schaefferwt@state.gov">schaefferwt@state.gov</a>) NO LATER THAN 5:00 PM EST ON OCTOBER 20, 2010.<br /><br />THE NEW ANTICIPATED AWARD DATE IS EXPECTED ON OR BEFORE JANUARY 15, 2011.<br />**************************************************************

The work includes the following: a. Demolish approximately 850 square feet of existing concrete pavement behind the bulkhead at the travel lift area, b. Excavate and remove deleterious material under existing concrete pavement, c. Fill voids under new pavement area with clean compacted granular fill, approximately 500 cubic yards, and d. Construct new structural concrete slab and concrete beams structure, supported on four new 14-inch square precast concrete piles. Perform ground penetrating radar and hand-excavation techniques required to identify the location of all underground buried utilities in the area prior to driving new piles.

However, in accordance with FAR Part 19.1303, if your firm is HUBZone certified or 19.1403 if your firm is an SDVOSB and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by <br />e-mail to berta.c.gomez@uscg.mil with "Sources Sought for Solicitation Number HSCG82-11-B-PMVA09" in the subject line or by fax (305) 278-6696.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to negotiate with Advanced BioScience Laboratories Inc. (ABL), Rockville, Maryland for a six (6) month continuation of Contract N01-AI-30057 to continue to perform quantitative viral RNA studies since many of the nonhuman primate studies are still ongoing at the three Simian Vaccine Evaluation (SVEU) contract sites. The studies include performing assays on samples collected from the following SVEU studies: Evaluation of the immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA/SIV vaccines with or without IL-12, IL-15 or RANTES; Virus-like particles containing clade A envelope; Protective efficacy of glycan-modified Env vaccines against heterologous SHIV challenge; Foreskin/penile infection with SIVmac251; Acute intra-rectal SIV infection studies; Mucosal immunization (cervical; Ad5/SIV); and other planned SVEU studies.
<p>The quantitative viral RNA contract is an integral part of the SVEU laboratories and is a very important resource for the AIDS vaccine research community. The contractor has been using a proprietary Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA) and real-time NASBA assays to assess quantities of the viral RNA in the samples provided by SVEU laboratories. For consistency of the assay and for comparison with existing results, NIAID is requesting a continuation of the contract for six (6) months from 9/30/2010 to 3/29/2011.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received will be considered by the Government. Interested parties who believe that they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may identify their interest by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting their claim. Please include contact person(s) and phone numbers, and identify the type of business, e.g. educational institution, small business, large for profit, research non-profit, etc. The Government will consider any such information received within 45 days of the publication date of this notice. A determination by the Government not to continue with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no responses are received within 45 days, the Government shall negotiate and modify the contract listed above. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1, 523 Boston VA Medical Center.  Requisition # A313118

2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a three chamber ProOx C21 to study the effects of varying levels of sustained hypoxia on gene expression, proteomics and ultrastructure of bladder, prostate and penile smooth muscle, epithelial and endothelial cells.  This is to be purchased from Biospherix.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  
Our previous studies with a cell culture OxyCycler-C model have revealed important role of cyclical hypoxia/reoxygenation in penile, bladder, and prostatic smooth muscle and epithelial pathology. We do not know, however, whether pathologic changes in the OxyCycler-C result from hypoxia or from reoxygenation injury. We need a ProOx C21 system to determine the effects of varying degrees of hypoxia alone (without reoxygenation) and to distinguish cellular hypoxic reactions from reoxygenation injury. Our studies require a three chamber ProOx system that allows assessment of mild, moderate and severe hypoxia bladder, prostate and penile cell culture system. The ProOx system in conjunction with our existing OxyCycler-C model will help to explore newer pathways of the pathophysiology of ischemic and hypoxic lower urinary tract disorders.     

4.	Statutory Authority:  

FAR Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source.

( x )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  
BioSpherix is the inventor and the only provider of the ProOx C21 system for cell culture studies. The ProOx C21is equipped with unique oxygen chambers capable of monitoring constant levels of oxygen tension in cell culture for desired time points of study. The BioSpherix ProOx C21 will enable us to study the effects varying degrees of hypoxia on bladder, prostate and penile cell culture systems. The ProOx C21 system will allow us to distinguish the impact of hypoxia from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in cell culture.   



6.	Actions to Promote Competition:
The following vendors (include phone number and contact name) were contacted, 
However, were unable to provide these services:

1.	Harvard Apparatus. They do not provide a comparable ProOx system. 

2.	World Precision Instruments. They do not provide a comparable ProOx system.

3.	 Astromed Inc. They do not provide a comparable ProOx system.


7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 29,751.00 to include the following items:
a.	3 (ea) Single setpoint 02/C02 controller
b.	3 (ea) Two Shelf C-Chamber
c.	1 (ea) Desktop PC with LCD fully configured for C21 system

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  In accordance with FAR 10.001 market research was conducted to find out if other contractors offer the same type of service/system. The research yielded that other vendors do not provide the specific ProOx system for cell culture needed for our studies.  

9.	Other Considerations:  
Based on our search, BioSpherix produces the most reliable ProOx system for cell culture studies. Furthermore, other vendors do not provide the type ProOx system needed for our studies.


10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: 
No other firm/vendor has expressed an interest in this purchase.  Biospherix is the only vendor that has this product available.


11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: N/A



12.
