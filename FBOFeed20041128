MANDATORY SHIPPING DIRECTIONS

PCO Logistics:

	PCO Logistics is required to track equipment, materials and goods coming into Iraq under the Re-building Iraq effort. This tracking and inherent accountability process will assist in assuring that all equipment materials and goods are able to cross the borders and move to final destination with minimal delay and at reduced risk.   However, in order to accomplish this mission, maximum cooperation is necessary.  Prompt notification and compliance with our information requirements will assist in providing advance notice to the point of entry of all inbound shipments.  This process affords coordination in the movement of all convoys which will enable improved monitoring and de-conflicted convoy schedule.  Prompt notification also improves security coordination through the operations center.
To get started follow the following steps:   

Step One: 
Upon contract award the contractor is required to provide the necessary logistical information needed by PCO Logistics. This information can be provided and updated as necessary by going to the PCO website (http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net) and logging in by selecting “Contractor/Vendor Log In” under the Logistic heading.  Initial log in will require the user to request a user name and password. Once the username and password is provided the user can identify and grant access to the other members or subcontractors.    Should there be any problems with this process contact the Logistics Movement Coordination Center (LMCC) Watch Officer directly at the following e-mail address:  pcolmcc@halliburton.com and the necessary assistance will be provided.  If the interim process is still in place the contractor will find four (4) forms listed and available under the logistics heading (Logistics Information Requirements Form, Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form, Cargo Plaques and Logistical Support Request).  Those forms should be individually completed and, with the exception of the cargo plaque, sent electronically to the above mentioned e-mail address for the LMCC.  The first form submitted will be the Logistics Information Requirements Form. The Logistics Information Requirements Form should be completed upon award of contract and updated as necessary.  All updates and changes to this form should be sent to the same e-mail address as the original form.  Additional contact information is available on the website mentioned above. Always reference the contract number.  

Step Two:
CPA 1-47  CUSTOMS LEVY EXEMPTION AND SHIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AND CONTRACTING OFFICE (PCO) 

Effective 15 April 2004 Tariff Regulations pursuant to CPA Orders #54, as amended by Order #70 (Orders #54 and #70 are posted on the website), require commercial importations into Iraq to pay a 5% levy except for food, books, medicine, medical equipment, clothes and oil.   Additional exemptions include NGO’s, International Organizations, Reconstruction Projects under PCO, and single exempt donations.   Items shipped under this contract are exempt from this “Levy” provided a completed Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form is attached and included with each invoice and packing slip.  
 
The contractor is required to fill out the Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form and attach the duty free form to each shipment of goods under this contract that crosses the border into Iraq in order to qualify for the exemption.  The contractor must submit one copy of the completed duty free form and a copy of the first page of the primary contract, for customs verification, to the contracting officer and the PCO Logistics Office at pcocustoms@halliburton.com) 72 hours prior to the planned arrival date at the Iraq point of entry.


Step Three:
The items being acquired are for Iraqi Reconstruction and as per the “Packing and Marking Instructions” of this contract, and shall be Packaged and Marked accordingly.  Additionally, a Cargo Plaque is available from the website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net under the logistics tab located at the top of the page.  There is a memorandum posted that explains how to complete the plaques.  There are three plaques, one is for shipments arriving into Baghdad International Airport, one is for shipments arriving into the Port of Umm Qasr, and the third one is for all other shipments.  The use of these plaques will ensure they are properly identified as PCO shipments and will reduce risk of loss or pilferage.  Each shipment must have a cargo plaque affixed to all sides of each container, pallet, or package.
 
Step Four:
If this contract has the shipment bound for a PCO warehouse location and will require PCO Logistics to assist in the shipment from the point of entry into Iraq or material handling equipment support at the warehouse, a Logistical Support Request (LSR) must be completed and submitted 48 hours prior to expected movement of the shipment or its arrival at the point of entry.  The LSR can be found at the above mentioned web site under the logistics tab.

It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide all the requested information mentioned above as well as using the identified cargo plaques in sufficient time to allow for required delivery.  Failure to comply with these instructions may result in a delay of the goods and materials being shipped from arriving at their final destination. Delays resulting from failure to follow the above steps may be assigned as the contractor’s responsibility.
