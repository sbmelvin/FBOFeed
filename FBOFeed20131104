<a href="mailto:heather.stiles2@us.army.mil">ACC-RSA - (Aviation)</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command-Redstone, on behalf of Project Manager - Aircraft Survivability Equipment; Product Manager - Countermeasures, intends to solicit a twenty-six (26) month Base Effort for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program in furtherance of the laser based Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) system.  Ten (10) options may be exercised if determined to be in the best interest of the Government, including: aircraft integration for follow-on army and other service platforms, A-Kit engineering and test support, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), procurement of Technical Data Package (TDP), NAVY Informational Assurance (IA) and NAVY B-Kit EMD development.  The first follow-on aircraft for integration will be the AH-64E.  The Government does not guarantee the exercise of any option within the RFP or any resultant contract.  If some or all of the Contract Options 1-10 are exercised, the period of performance may be extended by twenty-one (21) months.   <br>  <br> The CIRCM system provides force protection to rotary-wing, tilt-rotor and fixed wing aircraft from infrared (IR) guided missiles.  The CIRCM is the next generation light weight, laser-based IRCM component that will interface with both the Army's Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and the Navy's Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS).  The Government intends to release a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) for the CIRCM EMD effort.  The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this DRAFT RFP and no proposals will be accepted at this time.  Comments or questions will be accepted and responded to.  It is anticipated that this EMD effort will be awarded to a single contractor utilizing full and open competition.  Source selection procedures contained the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 15.3, shall be utilized to select the successful offeror after release of the formal RFP.  Contractors pursuing award of a Government contract must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) prior to being awarded a DoD contract.  To be eligible for contract award, offerors must have completed a successful Preliminary Design Review meeting CIRCM System Performance Requirements held before, at a minimum, an authority delegated by a Component Acquisition Executive.  The offeror must also provide a design which has attained Technology Readiness Level of at least 6, executed by an independent review team and properly certified by, at a minimum, a Component Acquisition Executive delegated authority (e.g. DASA R&T for the Army).  This effort requires access to classified information.  Participation by contractors, subcontractors or vendors with Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) to work on the CIRCM program is permitted; provided however, that such participation shall be in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and policies regarding access to U.S. Government information--specifically the National Disclosure Policy, Annex A.  A hybrid Firm Fixed Price/Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (with Technical Performance Incentives) contract is being contemplated.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541712.  <br>  <br> The requirement for the EMD effort includes design, development, fabrication, integration and test of the B-Kit for the CIRCM System. In addition to designing, developing, integrating and testing platform installation kits (A-Kit) for the US Army UH-60M helicopters, the effort will include all engineering and materiel required for the CIRCM System and initial manufacturing capability.  The EMD phase will focus on meeting performance requirements and designing for producibility.  The Technical risk moving forward into the EMD Phase is driven by the ability of the CIRCM system to meet the CIRCM System Performance Specification (SPS) (A-Kit and B-Kit combined) weight requirements (120 pounds for small aircraft and 155 pounds for large aircraft) and the Probability of Countermeasure (Pcm) which is a classified Key Performance Parameter.  The Government intends to include Technical Performance Incentives in areas that will be identified in the DRAFT RFP, the final RFP, or both.  The intent of the EMD phase is to integrate a system for multiple rotary and small fixed wing aircraft and demonstrate manufacturing readiness.  During the EMD phase the contractor must deliver eight (8) CIRCM A-Kits and twenty-one (21) CIRCM B-Kit Ship Sets.  The first three (3) CIRCM A-Kits must be delivered no later than eight (8) months after contract award and the last five (5) must be delivered no later than eighteen (18) months after contract award.  The first three (3) CIRCM B-Kit Ship Sets must be delivered no later than eight (8) months after contract award; the following six (6) must be delivered no later than eleven (11) months after contract award; the next five (5) must be delivered no later than twelve (12) months after contract award; the next one (1) must be delivered no later than thirteen (13) months after contract award; and the last six (6) CIRCM B-Kit Ship Sets must be delivered no earlier than eighteen (18) months after contract award.   <br>  <br> The US Army intends to release the DRAFT RFP within approximately three weeks of this synopsis.  Interested parties should monitor the Army Single Face of Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business Opportunities Web Site on the AMCOM Contracting Center Public Web Site for release of the DRAFT RFP and the formal RFP.  No telephone requests for the DRAFT RFP or formal RFP will be accepted.  If you are unable to access the ASFI Web Site, you may fax your request to 256-842-8029, ATTN: CCAM-OS-S, Eddie M. Whitfield or you may send your request by email.  There are no plans to conduct an Industry Day for this requirement. <br>  <br> Respondents should identify their company's name, address, CAGE Code, and whether they are a large or small business.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or sensitive information contained in their response.

<SUBJECT>Fingerprint Based Background Checks for Medicare Provider/Supplier Fraud Prevention
<SOLNBR>HHSM-500-2014-RFP-0058
<CONTACT>Antoinette R Hazelwood, Contract Specialist, Phone 4107861579, Email antoinette.hazelwood@cms.hhs.gov - Jacob Reinert, Contract Specialist, Phone 4107861278, Email jacob.reinert@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to satisfy the enrollment requirement in Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) regulation (72 FR 5862), published February 2, 2011 (http://federalregister.gov/a/2011-1686) and implemented at 42 CFR &sect;424.518(c)(2)(B), for fingerprint-based background checks. CMS is the largest purchaser of health insurance in the United States. CMS is pursuing an aggressive National Fraud Prevention Program (NFPP) to prevent fraudulent transactions from occurring and moving away from the "pay and chase" model. CMS is accountable for strengthening existing program integrity activities for the prevention and detection of fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and Children's Health Insurance Program.
<p>The fingerprint-based background check process is a screening mechanism to prevent questionable providers and suppliers from enrolling in Part A and Part B of the Medicare program. Fingerprint-based screening will impact the initial enrollments of providers/suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics/Orthotics &amp; Supplies (DMEPOS) and Home Health Agencies (HHA), providers/suppliers coming back into the Medicare fee-for-service program from a moratoria status, and existing providers/suppliers who CMS has classified as high risk. The requirement will entail the background check of approximately 7,500 authorized representatives of Medicare providers and suppliers classified by CMS as high risk, with an optional 10,000 increase in providers/suppliers to be exercised with the option year. Enrolled or enrolling providers/suppliers are responsible for fingerprint records as a condition of the application process. Fingerprint and background check records, review of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) provided criminal history record information (CHRI), and CMS disposition of the CHRI results are new requirements for the CMS Medicare provider enrollment process.</p>
<p>CMS is seeking a single contractor, who is a FBI- approved Channeler to manage channeling of fingerprint records, to submit fingerprints for background checks, to receive CHRI furnished by the FBI and to store and review the CHRI for CMS. The contractor shall have an executed FBI-Channeler agreement, at the time of proposal submission, covering the period of performance for this award. This agreement shall be kept current for the duration of the contract period and proof of the current agreement will be required prior to the exercise of any options. Independently, and as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary services, personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform this contract. The contractor's role in CMS' implementation of the fingerprint-based background check will include performing Channeler functions and Non-Channeler functions.</p>
<p>Implementation of the CMS Rule (72 FR 5862) requires the agency to interpret the results of collected CHRI and make a decision if potential Medicare providers and suppliers meet the requirements of the final adverse legal actions limitations on enrollment. The review and interpretation of CHRI during the CMS Medicare enrollment process, for the purposes of this contract, will be referred to as an activity of the Non-Channeler function. For purposes of this contract, CMS requires a contractor to perform Non-Channeler activities to ascertain whether the CHRI information obtained through the FBI-Channelers contain conviction information that would result in an enrollment violation or otherwise fail to meet requirements or guidelines established by CMS for enrollment of a Medicare provider or supplier. <br /><br />CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Fingerprint-based background checks on or about November 18, 2013. The contract will be a firm-fixed price Small Business set-aside to include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is December 18, 2013 with an anticipated award date of February 28, 2014.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>The Washington Aqueduct provides portable water to approximately one million people in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. Finished water from the Washington Aqueduct is pumped to our wholesale customers through one of four service mains namely; the low service main, the first high service main, the second high service main or the third high service main. Potable water from the Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant is pumped via our first high service to the First High Reservoir. This reservoir has a capacity of 14.5 MG and is located at intersection of Whitehaven Parkway and Foxhall Rd in Washington. DC. <br>  <br> The project consists of providing a comprehensive rehabilitation to the First High Reservoir to address drainage, safety, operational and sanitary survey issues previously identified. This will result in a structurally sound reservoir, improving water quality and operation within the distribution system. This reservoir is a critical component of the distribution system and so the construction period has to be minimized.  <br>  <br> The work includes civil, structural, mechanical and electrical improvements to the First High Reservoir to increase its reliability and improve its function. Specific work items include floor, wall, column and roof slab structural repairs, waterproofing membrane installation, surface drainage improvements and large valve, gate and piping improvements.  <br>  <br> The project also involves the demolition and re-building of the existing sample building. <br>  <br> The proposed procurement will be unrestricted, using NAICS Code: 237110 with a business size standard of $33.5 million. The estimated magnitude of construction is between $10,000,000.00 and $25,000,000.00.   <br>  <br> The solicitation will be provided in an electronic format, free of charge on or about 21 August 2013, to all authenticated account holders registered with the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. Please see the attached document for full details. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Communications, Electronics, Research, Development and Engineering Command (CERDEC) Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is conducting this Request for  Information (RFI) to identify potential providers of a Communications Intelligence (COMINT) collection system for installation aboard a De Havilland DHC-8-300 series aircraft. <br>  <br> Purpose: <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a request for Quotations or Proposals.  No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI.  No contract award or funding of any kind will occur as a result of this RFI.  The Government will not pay for any response expenses.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government encourages teaming/partnering.  The lack of the submission of data at this time will not eliminate any firm's participation in the future competition of a competitive contract.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential providers of a COMINT collection system with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 7 for installation aboard a De Havilland DHC-8-300 series aircraft. <br>   <br> Airborne COMINT System Description: <br>  <br> The Army has a critical requirement for a worldwide, self-deployable ISR capability that can immediately begin operations when arriving in theater and sustain long-term operations.  These capabilities: COMINT, Radar, and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), will provide the warfighter real time support to targeting, suppression of enemy air defenses, signal mapping, and support to small scale contingency (SSC) operations through the exploitation of enemy movers, sitters, and emitters.   <br>  <br> The COMINT collection system is required to provide direction finding (DF), recognition, copy, and exploitation functions.  The system must function against both conventional and modern signals.  It must also provide data to comply with the requirements specified in the Airborne Overhead Cooperative Operations Communications Intelligence Joint Interface Control Document Version 4.1 (Threshold) Released 1 June, 2010 (Version 4.2 Objective) to participate in Theatre Net-centric Geolocation (TNG).  The COMINT collection system must produce signal identification and target location accuracies sufficient to support target development, target tracking, and multi-sensor cross cue functions.  Multiple mission profiles must be supported.  The COMINT system must be controllable from 4 on-board operators using DCGS-A workstations and/or via remotely located workstations.  The system must provide a seamless interface to Operational Ground Station (OGS), current reporting networks, and to National data bases.  It must be highly reliable, easy to maintain, and have low sustainment cost.   <br>  <br> All responses must be submitted to usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-comint-rfi@mail.mil by 4:00 pm ET on November 18, 2013. <br>  <br> **Please see the attached document for full details**

<DESC>The U.S. Army is interested in locating manufacturers currently cutting and sewing Army Combat Uniforms or with previous experience in manufacturing the uniform according to specifications, that would be interested in participating in a permethrin treated fabric cut and sew trial.  Ideally the facility will have an isolated production line dedicated to ACU production.  The facility must be willing to allow access for the Government and contracted environmental sampling companies to collect environmental samples during regular ACU production with standard Nylon Cotton (NyCo) material (baseline) and then while using a permethrin impregnated material (trial).  Environmental sampling will take place over at least 2 days of production for both the untreated and treated materials.  Work area samples to be taken may include air collection in and around the facility and equipment as well as surface swabs.  Additionally, employees of the facility may be asked to wear small, lightweight air sampling pumps during the manufacturing process to measure the amount of permethrin present in the air in the immediate worker area.  The air sampling pumps clip onto the employee's belt and will not interfere with the employee's ability to complete their work.  Hand swabs of employees' skin (such as hands and arms) may also be included in determining the amount of permethrin released into the work environment during the manufacturing process. Results of any personal sampling can be made available and provided to the respective employee for entry into their medical records.  Facilities must be willing to cease production of the untreated ACUs in the trial area during the permethrin fabric trial.  All treated uniforms manufactured during the study will be transferred to the Army PM for fielding.    <br>      <br>   Information provided should include the manufacturer's ability to provide an operational and isolated production line, capabilities to produce first quality ACUs, facility diagrams (to include layout, square footage,  location and number of air circulation fans, types of filters etc.), number of cutting and sewing operations and personnel per operation, description of all identified activities/processes that employees will be involved in for each work area during manufacturing, shift length and number of shifts being run, facility air exchange rate, location and operational status of any local exhaust ventilation (such as an exhaust fan with flexible hose/elephant trunk attachment), the number of days required to cut and sew 3,000 full uniforms, the number of shifts per day and the length of the shifts.   <br>         <br>   Manufacturers should also provide a cost estimate to cut and sew 3,000 ACU coats and/or trousers. Treated fabric (and untreated fabric if ACUs are not currently being produced) will be provided by the Government.  Cost estimates should consider all aspects of the assembly process excluding the fabric.  There is an opportunity for plus-up should one be required to reach 80-100% production capacity.  Anticipated timeframe for cut and sew trial is Winter2013/Spring 2014.    <br>      <br>   Information submitted shall include: 1. Company name and address. 2. Point of contact, telephone, fax, Web address, and e-mail address. 3. Relevant company background/experience (including information detailed in the FedBizOps Note 25 regarding a firm's experience, personnel, and facilities)    <br>      <br>   This Market Survey is for information purposes only and does NOT bind the U.S. Government to any type of contracting action, or guarantee any purchase by the U.S. Government.    <br>      <br>   Submittals: Information about a particular brand/product should be submitted in electronic (MS Word) format by 4:00 pm EST on 25 Nov 2013 by e-mail to Ms. Melynda Perry at melynda.perry.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background/Objectives<br /></span>The Department of Defense (DoD) Health Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program is conducting market research in accordance with FAR Parts 10 to assess the current state and capabilities of electronic health record (EHR) products. DoD is contemplating an effort to replace its legacy EHR systems (i.e., Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA), Composite Health Care System (CHCS), Essentris, and the EHR component of the Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP)) with an "off-the-shelf" enterprise Electronic Health Record System (EHRS). Additional announcements may be posted to accommodate further market research activities. <br />For this specific announcement, DoD is interested in the current state and capabilities of an enterprise EHRS which are available "off-the-shelf" including VistA solutions. Enterprise EHRS are those product(s) or system(s) which provide a patient-centric, point-of-care system for use by clinicians and clinical staff throughout a patient's lifetime healthcare experience. DoD is interested in learning about product(s) that address all patient needs and include EHRS management, patient care plan, decision support, order management, medication, workflow, and documentation management which are positioned to support clinicians in all care environments to include outpatient, inpatient, emergency, intensive, specialty (e.g. OB/GYN, pediatrics, surgical and medicine specialties and subspecialties) and disconnected or remote care. <br /><br />The DoD is also interested in whether an EHRS product has been recognized or rated by third-party commercial research firms such as KLAS or Gartner, whether the product has attained certification and are listed on the Office of the National Coordinator Certified Health IT Product List, if the product has attained at least Stage 1 of Meaningful Use, possesses substantial commercial market share, or has been recognized by third party user surveys as relatively easy to learn, adopt, use and maintain. Interested vendors will be invited to provide an overview and demonstration to the Government of their EHRS product(s) which have been successfully deployed to large-scale, geographically-distributed medical systems and facilities. The purpose of this event is to gather information regarding commercial EHRS capabilities; the information may be utilized in the development of future DoD requirement(s) and/or solicitation(s). <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions for Interested Parties<br /></span>The Government plans to host demonstrations during the week of 21 October 2013 in the Greater Metropolitan Washington D.C. area. A completed application is required to be considered for vendor participation. There is no application fee; however, all costs incurred in responding to this announcement will be solely the responsibility of each individual vendor. Facilities with projection capability will be used; all other materials to include computers, software, and wireless internet must be provided by each individual vendor. Vendors interested in participating should provide a completed application form in accordance with the guidelines outlined to Jake Lewis at Jake.Lewis@tma.osd.mil no later than 5pm Eastern Standard time on 9 October 2013. Any questions to be addressed must be submitted prior to closing of application. They must be submitted to Jake. Lewis@tma.osd.mil. Vendors who do not participate in this Demonstration will not be excluded from any resulting solicitation. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Demonstration <br /></span><br />Upon receipt of the vendor application package, qualified applicants will receive an invitation to participate with detailed instructions. Vendors are requested to provide an overview briefing and product demonstration which addresses the topics above for a primary audience that includes end users and representatives from the requirements community. All proprietary information must be clearly marked IAW FAR Part 15. A summary of the session structure is provided in the attachment and subject to change based on Government discretion. <br />
<p>Demonstrations will be conducted in a one-on-one environment to ensure protection of any proprietary information. A Contracting Officer and Legal Counsel will be present during all demonstrations to ensure procurement integrity and equal treatment of all parties in accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act (10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304). Information or term and conditions for any future contracting vehicle(s) will not be discussed. <br /><br />This announcement is not a solicitation and issued solely for market research and planning purposes. It does not constitute a RFP or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This invitation does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Participation is not mandatory, required or a prerequisite for any future procurement activities. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. You are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred or associated with this invitation. All costs associated with this invitation will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>

<DESC>Validity Study and Evaluation Reports of <br />Current and Proposed Speaking and Reading Proficiency Tests <br />for the Foreign Service Institute (FSI)
<p>1.	Introduction</p>
<p>1.1.	Summary of Project (FSI reserves the right to split the award by line items):<br />The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) requires validation studies and evaluations of its current and proposed Speaking and Reading language proficiency tests:</p>
<p>Line Item 1: Contractor shall produce a validation study of the existing FSI Speaking &amp; Reading tests in Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>Line Item 2: The contractor shall provide an evaluation report of the proposed FSI Speaking tests in Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>Line Item 3: Contractor shall provide a, evaluation report of 3 proposed FSI language Reading test choices. The report shall include a recommendation for which of the 3 choices would be most appropriate for FSI based on FSI existing resources and FSI's needs assessment.</p>
<p>1.2.	Background:<br />Created in the 1980s, FSI's Speaking and Reading tests were based on existing research at the time, a survey of Foreign Service needs and the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) language proficiency scale, available on the www.govtilr.org site.  Tasks that Foreign Service Officers performed at post were the basis for the Speaking test. Printed text was the basis for the Reading test. A changing world prompted the Foreign Service Institute's leadership to test the validity of the FSI Speaking and Reading test in its current and proposed formats.</p>
<p>1.3.	The Foreign Service Institute (FSI):<br />FSI provides language testing services in 71 languages for Department of State personnel and in over 100 languages for client agencies. The U.S. presence abroad is different now than it was in the 1980s. Spoken language routines have changed in the last 30 years. Reading media have changed as well, and printed newspapers are no longer the main source of local information. Foreign Service personnel are all "ambassadors" of U.S. policy abroad. They browse the Internet, adjust fonts according to reading preferences, access social media and collect information using many different platforms and formats. The Department of State's direction to increase our Foreign Service presence abroad and improve its language capacity, together with two review studies of the FSI Reading test, as well as discussions with Foreign Service Officers, point to the need to evaluate the validity of both FSI tests.<br />2.	Contractor's Responsibilities</p>
<p>2.1.	Deliverable Products and Services:<br />&#61482;	The contractor will present progress reports for consideration by FSI followed by a meeting at FSI to discuss outcomes.  FSI can request progress report revisions and suggest changes after each meeting. This progress report is due on the last business day of each month of the project period of performance;</p>
<p>&#61482;	Line Item 1: The contractor shall produce a validation study of the existing FSI Speaking &amp; Reading tests in Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese.

<p>8.	Appendices</p>
<p>Current FSI Test:<br />Instructions to FSI Language Test Takers (Current Test)</p>
<p>The Speaking Test has three sections. The tasks examinees will be asked to perform are:<br />&#61482;	PART I_ The examinee will have a conversation in the language with the Tester on social, personal, and current event topics.<br />&#61482;	PART II_ The examinee will give an oral report on a topic which you select from choices provided by the testing team. These topics have bullets with suggestions that the examinee may use in the report. The examinee may use these suggestions or may draw on his/her own knowledge and experience about the topic. The examinee is requested to stay within the topic and concentrate on America in the report. Afterward, the examinee is expected to respond to follow-up discussion questions.<br />&#61482;	PART III_ The examinee will obtain information, facts, and opinions from the Tester on his/her country of origin in the language of the test on a topic that the examinee selects from several choices. Once the examinee has gathered enough information, the examinee will stop the Tester and report in English to the Examiner what s/he learned. The examinee will be expected to ask a new question after each report in English. This demonstrates the examinee's understanding and ability to manage an interaction in accomplishing a specific task.</p>
<p>The Reading Test has two sections. The tasks examinees will be asked to perform are:<br />&#61482;	PART I_ The examinee will have 6 minutes to read through six short texts in the language of the test and then tell the testing team about the general meaning and subject matter of the text you read. The texts in this section vary widely in subject matter and difficulty. Reporting on texts is done in English.<br />&#61482;	PART II_ The examinee will have 7 minutes to read in detail two longer texts selected from several choices. The examinee will provide the main idea and as many supporting details as s/he you can in their own words. Following the examinee's initial report, the examinee may be asked to re-read portions of the text, elaborate on what s/he already reported on, or provide more details. Reporting on texts is done in English.</p>
<p>Other Information about FSI Language Tests<br />During the Speaking exam, the Tester interacts with examinees only in the tested language. All interaction between examinees and the testing team during the Reading Exam is in English. Because the testing team is only interested in examinees' language proficiency, they need not divulge personal information, and may answer questions any way they like. Examinees are invited to answer all questions regardless of their point of view. Points of view and opinions that examinees express during the test do not affect the rating.</p>
<p>The whole FSI test, Speaking, Reading, and evaluation takes approximately 2.5 hours.</p>
<p>In most cases, examinees receive the results and feedback on their performance within 30 minutes of the end of the test.</p>
<p>Evaluating examinees' performance<br />The testing team considers several dimensions in evaluating test performance.</p>
<p>For the Speaking Exam, examinees are evaluated on their ability to:<br />&#61482;	Understand face-to-face interaction (comprehension); <br />&#61482;	Ability to organize their language and present ideas appropriately, effectively, and logically both in interaction and in extended speech (discourse); <br />&#61482;	Ability to use the grammatical and vocabulary features of the language in an accurate and appropriate manner (structure and lexicalization); <br />&#61482;	Ability and ease with which they speak the tested language (fluency).</p>
<p>For the Reading Test, examinees are evaluated on their ability to:<br />&#61482;	Derive overall meaning from a text (overall comprehension); <br />&#61482;	Understand the words used in the text (lexical comprehension) and of any contextual and implied meaning (discourse comprehension); <br />&#61482;	Ability to navigate through grammar (structural comprehension); <br />&#61482;	Ability and ease with which they read and process the texts (fluency).</p>
<p>The testing team compares examinees' test performance with specific performance level descriptions for each of these factors. They put together a profile of examinees' performance based on these descriptions, which is then matched to the description of the proficiency level that fits. Examinees are given an 'S' (speaking) and 'R' (reading) score (e.g., S 1 R 1).</p>
<p>The proficiency levels are those described in the ILR Skill Level Descriptions. There are six base levels, 0 through 5. Level 5 represents language ability equivalent to that of a highly articulate well-educated native speaker, whereas level 0 represents no usable proficiency. In instances where examinees' performance show characteristics of a higher proficiency level, but not consistently at the higher level, a '+' is added.</p>
<p>Proposed FSI Speaking Test:<br />Instructions to FSI Language Test Takers (Current Test)</p>
<p>The Speaking Test has three sections. The tasks examinees will be asked to perform are:<br />&#61482;	PART I_ Examinees will be invited to provide some information about themselves. The tester will draw a daily life topic from that data set and follow up with a conversation in the language on social, personal, and current event topics.<br />&#61482;	PART II_ The examinee will receive a set of 6 topics illustrative of State Department and USAID career tracks. Some of these topics are of general interest to accommodate new hires and examinees from client agencies. The examinee and the tester will have a discussion about the selected topic. The examinee is requested to stay within the topic and concentrate on American standards.<br />&#61482;	PART III_ Remains the same as in the current Speaking test.</p>
<p>9.	Evaluation Factors for Award:</p>
<p>All proposals will be evaluated on the following criteria. The first three technical factors: Understanding of Work, Proposed Resources and Approach, and Personnel Qualifications are of equal importance and when combined with Past Performance are more important than Price. Sub-factors listed under each factor are of equal importance to each other.</p>
<p>A proposal that has no weaknesses and no particular strengths above and beyond meeting the basic requirements defined for a particular evaluation criteria element, will receive less than the full credit available on that element. To achieve the full credit for an element, the proposal must go well beyond the requirement.  The most highly rated proposals will offer exceptionally innovative or particularly well thought out or insightful methods, procedures, solutions or new opportunities for major improvements.</p>
<p>Quality<br />&#61482;	Understanding of Work:<br />_ Capabilities Statement <br />_ Demonstrated ability to work effectively in cooperation and collaboration with client representative(s), with minimal direct guidance, to accomplish a common goal.</p>
<p>&#61482;	Proposed Resources and Approach:<br />This criterion will be scored on the strength of the proposed resources and approach that the Offeror will commit to the contract to address the requirements.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror on their entire proposed technical approach for meeting the scope of work and General requirements and performance standards. The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated on evidence of specific methods, techniques, and approaches that demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements of the Language Testing Unit.</p>
<p>Proposed methods and techniques will include, but are not limited to:<br />&#61692;	Proficiency testing evaluation<br />&#61692;	Organizational structure<br />&#61692;	Staffing Plan<br />&#61692;	Quality Assurance <br />&#61692;	Implementation plan as applicable</p>
<p>&#61482;	Personnel Qualifications:<br />Formal academic training or education in foreign or second language testing. <br />The Government will evaluate, at minimum, information contained in the resumes submitted with the proposal, of the proposed Key Personnel and staff. Evaluation will be based on the extent to which personnel submitted by the Offeror meet, or exceed skills, experience and education required in performing the work.</p>
<p>The proposal must include resumes of the following:<br />* Key personnel<br />* Alternate key personnel<br />* All other proposed personnel available to fulfill the requirement</p>
<p>Past performance:<br />This criterion will be scored on the degree of relevancy and success in past performance efforts of a similar scope, size, complexity, and subject matter. The evaluation will focus on the Offeror's technical understanding and technical capability as demonstrated by the size, scope, complexity, and results achieved in the completion of actual contracts/task orders similar to those expected under this contract. Technically complex tasks will be rated more highly than tasks of lesser size, scope, and complexity. The evaluation will also focus on innovative approaches taken and results achieved by the Offeror in prior complex engagements.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall identify three (3) contracts/task orders with the Federal Government and/or commercial customers that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance in the field of foreign language proficiency testing. Recent is defined as within the last three years. Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude of the work described in this Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>In addition the Offeror shall specifically address the following; <br />&#61482;	Successful past performance with conducting validity studies in the area of communicative, proficiency-oriented foreign language testing;<br />&#61482;	Past performance evaluating successful testing instruments built for adult foreign language proficiency testing and demonstrated knowledge and understanding of adult learning principles;<br />&#61482;	Successful experience applicable to applying research and development tools in support of communicative, proficiency-oriented foreign language testing.</p>
<p>Price<br />Price will be evaluated by the acquisitions office aside from the technical and past performance evaluation. A contract may be awarded to other than the lowest priced proposal. FSI seeks the best overall value. However, in cases where proposals are technically equivalent or substantially similar, cost and price may become the determining selection factor.</p>

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION/SYNOPSIS<br /></strong><br />This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources including small and small disadvantaged businesses to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement.<br /><br />
<p><strong>BACKGROUND<br /></strong><br />This National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) project is for work related to the contract below:<br />-	Topical Microbicide Safety and Efficacy Evaluation in Nonhuman Primates, University of Washington (Contract HHSN266200700013C)</p>
<p>This contract was awarded on a competitive basis for a seven year period in 2007 with the objective of developing topical microbicides aimed at the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) through pre-clinical testing in nonhuman primates (NHPs).  The period of performance is May 31, 2007 to May 30, 2014.  The value of the contract is $11,062,715.  When potential contractors were solicited in 2007, the NIAID received two proposals in response, resulting in the contract award to the University of Washington.</p>
<p>During the course of this contract, there have been ten microbicide products and barrier devices tested in thirteen studies.  These products represent a range of types from viscous gels to delivery devices to administer compounds to the vaginal and rectal compartments.  These product evaluations include safety parameters, documentation of adverse events, and in a subset of products, evaluation of efficacy.  Currently, the University of Washington is conducting a Chlamydia vaccine study in female pigtailed macaques.  This study includes pathogenesis and treatment studies of Chlamydia trachomatis, evaluation of immunity to heterotypic and homotypic chlamydial strains, and studies of pelvic inflammatory disease evaluating the presence and extent of cervicitis, the effects of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents on the course of PID, the characteristics of the immune response in the pigtailed macaque, potential vaccine candidates, and the persistence of infection in the upper reproductive tract.</p>
<p>Through expiration of the current contract, the University of Washington will complete the pathogenesis study on their colony of female pigtailed macaques to determine the extent to which the wild type strain of Chlamydia D/LC/P+ with an intact CT135 gene and plasmid can infect this NHP causing lower and upper reproductive tract infection, in relation to the infection-incompetent strain D/EC/P- with a disrupted CT135 gene and plasmid for comparison.  These strains were developed at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories of NIAID wherein the infectious wild type parent strain, D/LC/P+ with an intact CT135 gene and plasmid, was genetically manipulated to make the Chlamydia vaccine strain, D/EC/P- with a disrupted CT135 gene and plasmid, therefore making it infection incompetent.  Upon completion of the pathogenesis study, testing for the efficacy of the Chlamydia vaccine can begin.  As such, the NIAID intends to award a contract to the University of Washington for the efficacy study portion of this vaccine study as it cannot be performed as part of the existing severable contract and requires completion through the existing monkey colony.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NIAID.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Research and Development Sources Sought Notice is to discern whether or not there are other contractors, including small or small disadvantaged businesses, capable of and interested in performing the work described herein.  The NIAID does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>As a result of this R &amp; D Sources Sought Notice, the NIAID may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) if it deems this necessary and appropriate.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NIAID shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NIAID's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications of any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to continue development of a Chlamydia STD vaccine by performing an efficacy study in pigtailed macaques.  This efficacy study follows the pathogenesis study completed under the current contract with University of Washington.  The NIAID seeks to test this vaccine for efficacy using the female pigtailed macaque at the University of Washington against sexually transmitted Chlamydia D/LC/P+ with an intact CT135 gene and plasmid to determine if it can proceed to a phase 1 clinical trial.</p>
<p><br /><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The NIAID intends to solicit the University of Washington to perform an efficacy study, the next step in the development of a Chlamydia vaccine following the pathogenesis study currently being performed in the female pigtailed macaque colony at the University of Washington.  This work will consist of a vaccine efficacy study on two sets of female pig-tailed macaques over an 8 month period.  The study will begin with a series of baseline tests and procedures to evaluate the animal subjects including inspection of lower and upper reproductive tract tissue, blood draws for antibody response, cervical swabs for cytokine level detection in the vagina, evaluation of the cervical and vaginal tissues via colposcopy, and any other preliminary tests or procedures necessary.</p>
<p>Following these initial evaluations, one set of animals will receive a placebo and the other will receive the infection-incompetent strain D/EC/P- with a disrupted CT135 gene and plasmid, both administered vaginally at designated intervals over the course of 14 weeks at which point infection levels will be determined.  Both animal groups will then be re-infected with the wild type strain only and evaluated for 14 weeks with weekly or biweekly testing and procedures.  The results of the ongoing tests will be used to document immune responses both locally in the vagina and systemically to determine infection status over the course of the study.  Success of the vaccine will be determined by the antibody response to the vaccine and the presence or absence of lower reproductive tract infection.</p>
<p>The female pigtailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) is required for this project because of its similarities to the human female reproductive tract.  The pigtailed macaque has a 28-30 day menstrual cycle.  The anatomy and physiology of the reproductive system are well characterized and documented in the literature and the macaque is naturally susceptible to the human biovars of C. trachomatis without the need for pretreatment with exogenous hormones to initiate or sustain a chlamydial infection.</p>
<p>In order to complete this project, colposcopy examination of the pigtailed macaque to evaluate for signs of infection is necessary.  This is a minimally invasive procedure allowing the practitioner to view the cervix and vaginal vault structures.  It is used clinically to identify infections and its effects including tissue damage.  This procedure requires a colposcope appropriate for use on pig-tailed macaques and equipped with a digital camera to capture changes in animal tissue following development of lower reproductive tract disease or lack thereof.  The benefits of using this method are myriad and vital to the completion of this project.  Because it is a minimally invasive procedure, this method causes little or no discomfort meaning faster recovery time, quicker return to normal activity and no internal scarring.  The skill level needed for proper interpretation of colposcopic images is critical throughout the study, as errors could lead to misdiagnosis, incorrect data, and ultimately inaccurate endpoints, negatively impacting both timing and overall cost of the project.  The contractor will be responsible for performing colposcopic examinations of anesthetized female pigtailed macaques to check for signs of infection as well as monitoring and scoring upper reproductive tract tissues viewed through colposcopy digital imaging.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7350-00-290-0593<br />Name:		Plate, Paper, Glazed, White, Round, 6-1/2" Diameter<br />Description:	6-1/2" round x 1/2" deep un-compartmented paper plate made of molded pulp paper. Disposable plate is water and grease-resistant. Flat-bottom, nesting design. UOI is BX. BX = 1,000 plates per box.</p>
<p>NSN:		7350-00-290-0594<br />Name:		Plate, Paper, Glazed, White, Round, 9" Diameter<br />Description:	9" round x 3/4" deep un-compartmented paper plate made of molded pulp paper. Disposable plate is water and grease-resistant. Flat-bottom, nesting design. UOI is BX. BX = 1,000 plates per box.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7350-00-290-0593<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	HTMVACATECT; M217719; HUHPocket; 901-UX7WS/UX7WS; HUHPAPRO; SXP6PATH</p>

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to change the size of the blade for each of the NSNs listed in this Notice.  This Notice was originally posted on October 18, 2013.
<p>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.</p>
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		5110-00-NIB-0041<br />Name:		Scissor/Shear, Titanium blade, Straight handle, 8"<br />Description:	Titanium bonded blades with straight handles and 8" overall length. Silver/light grey blades are corrosion-resistant. Blade measures 3 3/4" long and 0.075" thick. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		5110-00-NIB-0042<br />Name:		Scissor/Shear, Titanium blade, Non-Stick, Straight handle, 8"<br />Description:	Titanium bonded non-stick blades with straight handles and 8" overall length. Silver/light grey blades are corrosion-resistant and resist tape and glue. Blade measures 3 3/4" long and 0.075" thick. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		5110-00-NIB-0043<br />Name:		Scissor/Shear, Titanium blade, Straight handle, 7"<br />Description:	Titanium bonded blades with straight handles and 7" overall length. Silver/light grey blades are corrosion-resistant. Blade measures 3 1/2" long and 0.075" thick. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		5110-00-NIB-0044<br />Name:		Scissor/Shear, Titanium blade, Bent handle, 8"<br />Description:	Titanium bonded blades with bent handles and 8" overall length. Silver/light grey blades are corrosion-resistant. Blade measures 3 3/4" long and 0.075" thick. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		5110-00-NIB-0067<br />Name:		Scissor/Shear, Titanium blade, Non-Stick, Bent handle, 8"<br />Description:	Titanium bonded, non-stick blades with bent handles and 8" overall length. Silver/light grey blades are corrosion-resistant and resist tape and glue. Blade measures 3 3/4" long and 0.075" thick. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Kansas City, MO.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			5110-00-NIB-0041<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ACM 13529; FSK01005409; UNV 92012</p>

<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:FOGGJC@ID.DOE.GOV">Fogg, Jeffrey C</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Aerojet-Rocketdyne (formerly Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, Inc), 6633 Canoga Avenue, Canoga Park, CA 91309, for a follow-on contract for mission support, data analysis and continued development of Multi-Mission Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTGs).
Aerojet-Rocketdyne has been responsible for the design, development, and manufacturing of all MMRTGs for the Department of Energy, therefore, it has been determined that, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The cost of this acquisition is anticipated be between $8M and $10M over a four-year period.  The NAICS is 927110. 
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements, as outlined in the scope of work described below, may give written notification prior to the response due date.  Responses are required to be submitted before November 18, 2013, 10:00 a.m. Mountain Time. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to foggjc@id.doe.gov and supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the scope of work. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.
SCOPE OF WORK - SUMMARY
Aerojet-Rocketdyne (AR) was awarded a competitively solicited contract to design, build and test the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) and fabricate flight quality units to support various NASA missions.  Due to planned missions either being cancelled or delayed, the only mission that was supported under this contract was the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), which required one MMRTG to power the Mars rover Curiosity.  Due to MSL mission delays, MSL launched in November, 2011, and is currently on Mars performing as designed.
The scope of this activity is for the continuation of MSL mission support and data analysis and completing the development of the Multi-Mission Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTGs) to support the Mars 2020 mission.  The Contractor will continue to serve as the System Integration Contractor/Design Agency (SIC/DA) for mission applications requiring the use of an MMRTG and will be responsible for the performance of the overall MMRTG.  SIC/DA responsibilities also includes providing information to support mission studies (i.e., analyzing the performance of the MMRTG in in various mission environments) and supporting activities associated with mission applications (fueling and testing MMRTGs at DOE facilities, transportation and launch activities at NASA facilities, providing design information to support launch approval activities, etc.).  An MMRTG will not be fueled during the execution of this Contract; however, key documents (e.g., performance specifications, interface working a greements, interface control documents, etc.) will need to be updated to support Mars 2020. The effort will occur in two phases as outline below.  The first phase is to provide mission support and data analysis and continue to provide SIC/DA support as needed.  The second phase is to complete the fabrication of the second and third MMRTG flight units (referred to as F2 and F3, respectively) and deliver the units to the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). The MMRTG will be required for the Mars 2020 mission with an expected launch window in the July/August 2020 time frame.  The F2 and F3 will be completed to support the Mars 2020 mission and will be similar to the MMRTG currently powering Curiosity on Mars. The primary scope of each Phase consists of:
Phase I: ?	Continue to store and maintain equipment associated with the MMRTG program; ?	Continue to support thermoelectric (TE) module box testing and associated data reporting and TE performance analysis; ?	Continue to support Engineering Unit (EU) data reporting and EU performance analysis; ?	Continue to provide necessary support for the MSL mission including associated data reporting and F1 performance analysis; ?	Update the MMRTG performance specification and other key documents (ICD, fueling and test plan ) to support Mars 2020; ?	Continue to provide SIC/DA support as needed; and ?	Long-lead procurement and fabrication of MMRTG components. Phase II: ?	Continue to store and maintain equipment associated with the MMRTG program; ?	Complete fabrication of F2 and F3 and ship to INL; ?	Update the IWA in preparation for SIC/DA support to the Mars 2020 mission; and ?	Provide support to INL and other contractors as needed to support Mars 2020 mission preparations.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.
A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Park Service, Santa Fe Major Acquisition Buying Office intends to award a contract for radio tower rental at the Port Mansfield Channel located in Port Mansfield, TX for Padre Island National Seashore (PAIS).  This contract will be issued with  One Base year and Four Option years.
Padre Island National Seashore is located in a remote area in the State of Texas.  Because of this, PAIS have major smuggling routes running through the Park.  This makes communications systems a critical life and safety issue for NPS/PAIS law enforcement personnel and park personnel.  In many of these areas, the parks radio system is the only communication system that provides coverage in the park.
Communications with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Kleberg County Sheriffs Office and various LE Dispatch operations in Texas is a critical life and safety for LE personnel along the US/Mexican border. DHS, which includes the Border Patrol and Customs/Immigration, is in the process of converting their radio system along the entire US/Mexican border to P-25 narrowband digital; and this conversion is currently impacting critical law enforcement communications between the border agencies. This system is digitally encrypted and utilizes Over the Air Re-keying (OTAR) for downloading encryption keys.  The Port Mansfield Tower located to the South of North Padre Island is the only radio tower system in the area that would allow for communications with Kleberg County Sheriffs office, and DHS sites.
The need for radio communications requires a provider that is familiar with, and can follow, and enable PAIS to communicate within the park and with Federal and State agencies. Radio communications in most incidents is the only way personnel can communicate at PAIS. Cell phone service is nonexistent and satellite phones may or may not work. The need is for a provider with experience and knowledge of providing radio tower capability in the Corpus Christi, TX area.  American Tower Corporation is the only known radio tower company close enough to North Padre Island to provide the radio communication service that is necessary for all communications in the park.  For these reasons, the selection of this vendor should save the government both time and monies in obtaining the necessary services.
Authority for this award is 10 U.S.C. 2304(1), FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) Only one Responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements and 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency.  
The sole source justification for this award will be provided upon request.  If you have specific questions or require clarification of this notice, please contact Pollard Mobley, Contract Specialist at 409-951-6814 or email at pollard_mobley@nps.gov.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br /> FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>Title:</strong> Seeking Information on Innovative Building Technologies -- Green Proving Ground&rsquo;s Fiscal Year 2014 Program</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gather responses from private sector entities, educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and other interested parties on emerging and innovative building technologies in support of its Green Proving Ground (GPG) program.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The GPG leverages GSA's real estate portfolio as a "proving ground" to evaluate emerging building technologies that promise to improve the environmental performance of GSA's portfolio while reducing operational costs.&nbsp; More specifically, the GPG program aims to identify technologies with the greatest potential to support the goals outlined in the President&rsquo;s June 2013 Climate Action Plan, as well as those that help meet GSA's mandated sustainability goals, particularly goals contained in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009, "Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance."&nbsp; GPG assesses the performance of innovative technologies in the real world context of operating buildings. &nbsp;Notable findings from GPG projects will support the evolution of performance specifications for the GSA portfolio and may inform decision making within GSA, other Federal agencies, and the real estate industry in deploying the technologies studied.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Throughout this document, &ldquo;technology&rdquo; refers broadly to integrated systems based on any combination of hardware (equipment) and software (processing), materials engineering processes, and resource management devices, methods, tools, or models based on scientific or engineering principles. &nbsp;Technologies appropriate for measurement and validation (M&amp;V) must be sufficiently mature that all required laboratory or other proof-of-concept work has been completed.&nbsp; Commercial technologies already broadly in use and readily available in the marketplace are not considered appropriate for the GPG M&amp;V projects.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>Overview of FY 2014 GPG Program Goals:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">GPG requests information about innovative, transformational green building technologies that: (1) have the potential to improve the environmental performance or lower the operating costs, or both, of the Federal real estate portfolio, (2) have promising early stage performance results, and (3) seek to bolster GSA&rsquo;s Federal role through the M&amp;V of early stage technologies in a real-world setting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>How to Submit Responses: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Private sector entities, educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and other interested parties wishing to be considered for GSA's GPG 2014 program, including those who have previously submitted information in response to past years' program requests, should respond to this RFI by completing the web-based questionnaire at the link provided below, as only the submissions initiated through the website will be reviewed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The web-based questionnaire can be found at:&nbsp; <a href="http://goo.gl/3czILT"><strong>http://goo.gl/3czILT</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Additional information may be subsequently requested during the GPG Program Planning Process.&nbsp; This announcement will remain open until <strong><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">9 PM Eastern on</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Monday, December 9, 2013.</span>&nbsp; </strong>Questions about this announcement should be directed to <strong>gpg_2014@gsa.gov.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>Information Session:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The GPG program team will host a web-based information session to discuss the program and clarify the RFI questionnaire on Tuesday, November 12 at 1 PM Eastern.&nbsp; You can attend this session by visiting: <a href="http://goo.gl/Dp8jUK"><strong>http://goo.gl/Dp8jUK</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>FY2014 GPG Program Process:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The GPG program will review and consider submitted technologies for enhanced M&amp;V as part of the 2014 program. &nbsp;To be selected, the innovative technology must either be (1) gifted unconditionally to GSA or (2) provided to GSA for testing under an agreement along with the payment of a fee to GSA.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><br /> GSA will not issue a Request For Proposals (RFP) as a follow-up to this RFI.&nbsp; Using the information collected, GSA may invite a subset of respondents to participate in the FY 2014 GPG program, under which their technologies must either be gifted to GSA or provided to GSA for testing under an agreement along with the payment of a fee to GSA for an enhanced M&amp;V performance study.&nbsp; Findings from the GPG studies will be used to support the evolution of GSA performance specifications and may inform decision making within GSA, other Federal agencies, and the real estate industry.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Responses to the RFI will be evaluated by the GPG program team according to the program goals described above through a multi-stage review process.&nbsp; Based upon the evaluation of the submissions, each respondent will be notified whether GSA will request (or will not request) the submission of a follow-up presentation.&nbsp; Respondents who are invited to submit additional information will be asked to provide a brief written presentation to GSA.&nbsp; After considering the follow-up material, if any, and the submissions, a subset of respondents will be asked to participate in additional discussions with GSA.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">GSA reserves the right to select for inclusion in the program any, all, or none of the submissions received. &nbsp;There is no commitment by GSA to make any contract awards, nor will GSA be responsible for any money expended by the respondents. &nbsp;GSA will not provide debriefs for those respondents that are not selected for inclusion in the program.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an RFP.&nbsp; Responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form an agreement or binding contract of any nature.&nbsp; Information received may be used to assist GSA in planning the scope of the 2014 M&amp;V technology performance studies and may be shared with other Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Respondents are advised not to include any confidential business information in the responses as the Government does not guarantee confidentiality of the information received.&nbsp; Although GSA asks that no confidential business information be submitted, it is GSA&rsquo;s practice to protect the provided information and make it available on a need-to-know basis only to Government personnel and contractors who will be using this information on behalf of the Government. &nbsp;However, GSA cannot guarantee that information, during transmission or while stored in its system or otherwise in GSA&rsquo;s custody or control or in the custody or control of another Federal agency, or their contractors, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, and GSA and the Government and their contractors will have no liability whatsoever for disclosure of such information.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) mission is to deliver the best value in real estate, acquisition, and technology services to government and the American people.&nbsp; GSA supports over&nbsp;1.1 million federal workers&nbsp;by managing more than 9,000 government-owned or leased properties (374.6 million square feet of workspace).&nbsp;In addition, the agency manages&nbsp;more than 60 billion dollars of government purchasing and a&nbsp;fleet of more than 200,000 government vehicles.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The mission of the GPG program is to, on a limited and carefully controlled basis, identify, test and evaluate innovative building technologies to improve the performance of Federal buildings across the country.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">&nbsp;</p>

No solicitation is available at this time. TSA is issuing this RFI for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment by the Government. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Training and Workforce Engagement (OTWE) is conducting market research for the purposes of identifying businesses who have demonstrated highly specialized or advanced capabilities in Specialized Security or Technical Training, X-Ray Training Simulation, Curriculum Development, Training kits, and Computer based training programs for threat image interpretation. The Contractor must create, provide, and deliver training kits, physical training aids, and specialized materials to enhance a Transportation Security Officer's (TSO) skills and abilities to identify threat items, including Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and its components, explosives, and weapons. <br /><br />I. DESCRIPTION<br /><br />Background:<br />The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA, Public Law 107-71) requires TSA to develop, implement, and manage training programs for their transportation security workforce. The mission of the Specialized Security Training (SST) program is to ensure continuation of vital training services needed by TSA to support initial and recurring specialized security training and to respond in a timely manner to security training needs related to emerging technologies and new threats. TSA's workforce is geographically dispersed at more than 450 airports and offices throughout the nation. The TSO population is hired through local processes at over 130 geographically dispersed hiring locations on a two-week hiring cycle. Approximately between 7,000 and 14,000 new TSOs are hired each year.

<SOLNBR>SOL-OAA-13-000134

<CONTACT>Securing Water For Food, Email securingwaterforfood@gmail.com
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <br />Solicitation Number: SOL-OAA-13-000134<br />Notice Type: Special Notice <br />Subject: Securing Water for Food: A Grand Challenge for Development <br />Issuance Date: August 30, 2013<br />Closing Date: October 4, 2013 <br />Closing Time: 14:00 (2:00 PM) EST<br />
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>On September 2, 2013 in Stockholm, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency Government (Sida), will launch Securing Water for Food: A Grand Challenge for Development.<br /><br />The Grand Challenges for Development (GCD) program is an innovation and acceleration initiative that began in 2011. Through GCDs, USAID and its partners are sourcing and accelerating the best science and technology-focused innovators, entrepreneurs, and businesses that have the potential to solve specific development challenges. Innovators can come from anywhere in the world. Implementation must take place in a developing or emerging country.</p>
<p>Securing Water for Food is the fifth GCD launched over the past two years and focuses on the water/food nexus. Through this program, we are seeking innovations that will improve water efficiency along the food value chain (see diagram below), thus boosting food security and alleviating poverty.</p>
<p>The United States Government, represented by the Agency for International Development (USAID) Office of Science and Technology (OST), and the Swedish government, represented by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), known henceforth as the Founding Partners, are seeking comments and/or questions from interested parties around the world to help us improve the attached program description in this Notice.</p>
<p>Submittal Information</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted within the body of the email or as an attachment.</p>
<p>Responses must include the following information:<br />&bull;Organization name and address;  <br />&bull;Organization point of contact name, telephone number, and email address; <br />&bull;Organization business size and status (e.g., small business, 8(a), HUBZone, etc.), the number of years in business, and affiliate information;<br />&bull;The organization's GSA Schedule contract number, if applicable.</p>
<p>In addition to general comments and suggestions, we are requesting specific responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1.Do you feel that the matching fund requirement (outside market-based financing or self-investment) is reasonable at the validation stage? <br />2.Should matching funds be an eligibility requirement for innovators at both the validation and scale/commercial growth stages? -Or-Should we only require matching funds as a milestone that must be met in order to receive additional Founding Partner financing?<br />3.Should we provide milestone-based funding? How do we provide milestone-based funding to ensure the best use of our resources and simultaneously allow for risk-taking and failure? <br />4.What is your perception of the eligibility and evaluation criteria? Are the evaluation criteria appropriate?  Is this rigorous evaluation process too complicated and time consuming for your organization? <br />5.Are the size of the grants enough of an incentive for you to apply to this program? <br />6.What elements of the services offered under "non-financial support/acceleration" are most attractive to you? Least attractive? Is anything missing?<br />7.How easy would it be for you to find experienced implementation partners in a developing or emerging country? <br />8.How could we improve the program to maximize partnership opportunities between medium- to large-sized companies and entrepreneurs? <br />9.How can we improve the design of the program to ensure that supported innovations are sustainable?</p>
<p>Submit responses to this RFI to securingwaterforfood@gmail.com no later than the time/date stated above.</p>
<p>The Founding Partners have not finalized all aspects of the new initiative and need meaningful and substantive comment from the broader community of interest. Subject to availability of funds, current estimated funding for the entire Securing Water for Food program is approximately $25 million. Of this total amount, the Founding Partners anticipate making approximately $15 million available for this solicitation. This Notice can be viewed and downloaded from the Internet at www.grants.gov and www.fbo.gov. The Founding Partners bear no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to this Notice may be issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you downloaded this notice. You are advised to regularly check the above Internet site for amendments and are encouraged to sign up for update notifications on the solicitation at www.grants.gov and www.fbo.gov. <br /><br />Please do not submit proposals or resumes as they will be discarded.  Submissions will not be acknowledged. USAID may use any information provided without incurring any obligation. No phone calls or hand carries please.</p>
<p>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI), not a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a Request for Applications (RFA) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government to issue any solicitation or ultimately award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. It should be noted that responding to this RFI will not give any advantage to any organization in the subsequent procurement. The U.S. Government will not provide answers to any question submitted in response to this request. Responses will be held confidential. Proprietary information should not be sent.</p>
<p>Issuance of this Notice does not constitute a binding commitment on the part of the Government to issue a Solicitation, nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of any comments. Further, the Government reserves the right to reject any or all comments received.</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance and interest in the Securing Water for Food Grand Challenge for Development.</p>
<p>We look forward to your organization's participation.</p>

The website provides access information as well as EDA Help Desk Support.<br />(End of clause)<br />DFAS 52.223-9000, "ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS" (July 2013)<br />The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Government's policies on Green Contracting. FAR 23.403 sets forth the Federal Government's policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals. Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products. EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials. Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) required federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products. Moreover, it required that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13514 (October 5, 2009), required federal agencies to analyze internal processes and revise reporting requirements in order to achieve such results as improvement of water use and efficiency, promoting pollution prevention and elimination of waste. But more particularly as related to procurement, an emphasis was placed on efforts to advance sustainable acquisitions to ensure that 95 percent of new contract actions including task and delivery orders, for products and services with the exception of acquisition of weapon systems, are energy-efficient (Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated - FAR 52.223-15, and -16 when specific to computer products), water-efficient (Goals within Executive Order 13514), bio-based (FAR 52.223-1 &amp; -2), environmentally preferable (FAR 52.223-10) and/or Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT - FAR 52.223-16) certified, non-ozone depleting (FAR 52.223-11), contain recycled content, or are non-toxic or less-toxic alternatives (FAR 52.223-3 &amp; DFARS 252.223-7006), where such products and services meet agency performance requirements.</p>
<p>&sect; 1. Mandatory Use of Paper and Other Products with Recycled Content.</p>
<p>(a) All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor affirmatively acknowledges that it will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm. In addition, by responding to this solicitation the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items (FAR 52.223-17).</p>
<p>&sect; 2 Notice of Green Alternatives in Offerors' Product/Service.</p>
<p>(a) When offering a product or service that contains "Green" components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm, the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products, and provide the certification required by FAR 52.223-4, when required.</p>
<p>&sect; 3 Affirmative Duty of Contractors to Adhere to Green Contracting Policy.</p>
<p>(a) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.</p>
<p>(b) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Luer Activated Needleless Connectors. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Luer Activated Needleless Connector products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Luer Activated Needleless Connectors. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Luer Activated Needleless Connectors will be established approximately March 2014 and will be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately April 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Luer Activated Needleless Connectors. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Luer Activated Needleless Connectors.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Luer Activated Needleless Connectors. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,280,817. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of those three product groups, two represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. Of those, one is considered the requirement for addition to the QSL and accounts for 73.14% ($936,810) of the total volume in sales, ($1,280,817). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.</strong> The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that its submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy).<strong> Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />Luer Activated Needleless Connectors requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification.<strong> A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NIAID-NOI-14C-1652215 a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-70 dated September 30, 2013. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside, however small disadvantage, minority, veteran owned, and HUB zone companies, etc., are encourage in submitting a proposal. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 811310, which has a small-business size standard is $7 million. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intends to procure a one year renewal maintenance service agreement with Becton, Dickinson, and Company (BD Biosciences) for the following flow cytometers: 1) LSR II Special (no lasers), serial #H47100117, 2) LSR II Special (no lasers), serial #H47100120, 3) LSR II Special (no lasers), serial #H4710041, 4) FACSAria Special (no lasers), serial #P46900011, and 5) FACSAria Special (no lasers), serial #P11000013. This is to include the attached list of lasers that will be used for replacement lasers for the five (5) flow cytometers listed. The purpose of this requirement is to provide maintenance on existing equipment of high throughput sampler systems. All parts and accessories must be compatible with existing equipment and no substitutions are allowed. The five (5) flow cytometer instruments are in constant use up to 7 days a week and the lasers are critical for the optimal functioning of the instruments. Without the lasers, these instruments are rendered non-functional. Samples that are tested are run through the instrument labeled with specific fluorescent antibodies that only emit a signal when hit with a certain wavelength of light emitted from the each of the lasers (red, blue, violet and green). During routine maintenance, these lasers are checked for power and signal strength and any that are suboptimal are replaced. These lasers are also replaced if they malfunction between routine maintenance. As these instruments are custom designed for the needs of the lab, the lasers that are an integral part of the instrument are designed such that they will work only with the customized instruments. There is no known lasers offered that will physically fit inside the instruments to provide the optimal signal strength and power to accommodate the functioning of the instrument. To use a different vendor for these lasers will cause the instruments to not be able to be calibrated to optimal specifications such that samples between experiments will not be able to be analyzed and compared. This would adversely affect the function of the lab and its mission. The contractor will quote for labor, travel expenses and parts (excluding consumables). The contractor will perform 2 preventative maintenance inspections to be performed during a 12 month period and include 2 PM Kits, software revisions released during the agreement term. Replacement with a certified refurbished unit, if required, at the discretion of the contractor, and if required will be provided within two (2) working days. The contractor will provide unlimited service visits, Monday - Friday excluding contractor's holidays, unlimited telephone support for instruments, reagents, and applications will be provided without any additional charge. The contractor will guarantee to respond to emergency on-site visits service Monday - Friday, (excluding contractor's holidays) within 48 hours. Period of Performance is one year from date of award to the location of Bethesda, Maryland 20892. In submission of your proposal include the company's Dun &amp; Bradstreet number (DUNS #). The award will be based on: 1) the capability to perform the required specifications, 2) price, and 3) delivery. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30.

As used in this clause-- <br>  <br> Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority. <br>  <br> Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. <br>  <br> (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall  represent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: <br>  <br> (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br>  <br> (2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br>  <br> (3) For long-term contracts-- <br>  <br> (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and <br>  <br> (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter. <br>  <br> (c) The Contractor shall re-represent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards. <br>  <br> (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. <br>  <br> (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. <br>  <br> (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. <br>  <br> (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: <br>  <br> The Contractor represents that it (  ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code      - assigned to contract number      . <br>  <br> (Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title). <br>  <br> (End of clause) <br>  <br>  <br> 52.222-17  Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers. (JAN 2013) <br>  <br> (a) Service employee, as used in this clause, means any person engaged in the performance of a service contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as those terms are defined in 29 CFR part 541. The term ``service employee'' includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a contractor or subcontractor and such persons. <br>  <br> (b) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer those service employees employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the service employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which the service employees are qualified. <br>  <br> (1) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of service employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the predecessor Contractor employed in connection with performance of the work. <br>  <br> (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, there shall be no employment opening under this contract, and the Contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation. <br>  <br> (i) The successor Contractor and its subcontractors shall make a bona fide express offer of employment to each service employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the service employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the service employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 days. <br>  <br> (ii) The successor Contractor and its subcontractors shall decide any question concerning a service employee's qualifications based upon the individual's education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee's experience on the predecessor contract, and the Contractor may utilize employment screening  <br> processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with Executive Order 13495. <br>  <br> (iii) Where the successor Contractor does not initially offer employment to all the predecessor contract service employees, the obligation to offer employment shall continue for 90 days after the successor contractor's first date of performance on the contract. <br>  <br> (iv) An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits. (See 29 CFR 9.12 for a detailed description of a bonafide offer of employment). <br>  <br> (c)(1) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (b) of this clause, the successor Contractor and any subcontractors (i) may employ under this contract any service employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who  <br> would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (ii) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any service employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 6701(3), and (iii) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any service  <br> employee(s) of the predecessor contractor whom the Contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job (see 29 CFR 9.12(c)(4) for additional information). The successor Contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the  <br> appropriateness of claiming any of these exceptions. <br>  <br> (2) In addition, any Contractor or subcontractor that has been certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration as a HUBZone small business concern must ensure that it complies with the statutory and regulatory requirements of the HUBZone Program (e.g., it must ensure that at least 35 percent of all of its employees reside within a HUBZone). The HUBZone small business Contractor or subcontractor must consider whether it can meet the requirements of this clause and Executive Order 13495 while also ensuring it meets the HUBZone Program's  <br> requirements. <br>  <br> (3) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to permit a Contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order or law. For example, the requirements of the HUBZone Program (see FAR subpart 19.13), Executive Order 11246 (Equal Employment Opportunity), and the Vietnam Era Veterans'  <br> Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 may conflict, in certain circumstances, with the requirements of Executive Order 13495. All applicable laws and Executive orders must be satisfied in tandem with, and if necessary prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 13495, 29 CFR part 9, and this clause. <br>  <br> (d)(1) The Contractor shall, not less than 30 days before completion of the Contractor's performance of services on the contract, furnish the Contracting Officer with a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. Where changes to the workforce are made after the  <br> submission of the certified list described in this paragraph, the Contractor shall, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause, not less than 10 days before completion of the services on this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer with an updated certified list of the names of all service employees employed within the last month of contract performance. The updated list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment, and, where applicable, dates of  <br> separation of each service employee under the contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors. <br>  <br> (2) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives. <br>  <br> (3) The Contracting Officer will direct the predecessor Contractor to provide written notice (Appendix B to 29 CFR chapter 9) to service employees of their possible right to an offer of employment with the successor contractor. Where a significant portion of the predecessor Contractor's workforce is not fluent in English, the notice shall be provided in English and the language(s) with which service employees are more familiar. The written notice  <br> shall be- <br>  <br> (i) Posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite; or    (ii) Delivered to the service employees individually. If such  <br> delivery is via email, the notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice. <br>  <br> (e)(1) If required in accordance with 52.222-41(n), the predecessor Contractor shall, not less than 10 days before  <br> completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors. If there are no changes to the  <br> workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor Contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of 52.222-41(n) are met. When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor Contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than 10 days prior to performance completion. <br>  <br> (2) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives. <br>  <br> (f) The Contractor and subcontractor shall maintain the following records (regardless of format, e.g., paper or electronic) of its compliance with this clause for not less than a period of three years from the date the records were created. <br>  <br> (1) Copies of any written offers of employment or a contemporaneous written record of any oral offers of employment, including the date, location, and attendance roster of any service employee meeting(s) at which the offers were extended, a summary of each meeting, a copy of any written notice that may have been  <br> distributed, and the names of the service employees from the predecessor contract to whom an offer was made. <br>  <br> (2) A copy of any record that forms the basis for any exemption claimed under this part. <br>  <br> (3) A copy of the service employee list provided to or received from the contracting agency. <br>  <br> (4) An entry on the pay records of the amount of any retroactive payment of wages or compensation under the supervision of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division to each service employee, the period covered by such payment, and the date of payment, and a copy of any receipt form provided by or authorized by  <br> the Wage and Hour Division. The Contractor shall also deliver a copy of the receipt to the service employee and file the original, as evidence of payment by the Contractor and receipt by the service employee, with the Administrator or an authorized representative within 10 days after payment is made. <br>  <br> (g) Disputes concerning the requirements of this clause shall not be subject to the general disputes clause (52.233-1) of this contract. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR part 9. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between or among any of the following: The Contractor, the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the service employees  <br> under the contract or its predecessor contract. The Contracting Officer will refer any service employee who wishes to file a complaint, or ask questions concerning this contract clause, to the: Branch of Government Contracts Enforcement, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,  <br> DC 20210. Contact email: displaced@dol.gov. <br>  <br> (h) The Contractor shall cooperate in any review or investigation by the Department of Labor into possible violations of the provisions of this clause and shall make such records requested by such official(s) available for inspection, copying, or transcription upon request. <br>  <br> (i) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the Contractor or its  <br> subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the Contractor  <br> or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order 13495, the regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law. <br>  <br> (j) The Contractor shall take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance. However, if the Contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the Contractor may request that the United States, through the  <br> Secretary, enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States. <br>  <br> (k) The Contracting Officer will withhold, or cause to be withheld, from the prime Contractor under this or any other  <br> Government contract with the same prime Contractor, such sums as an authorized official of the Department of Labor requests, upon a determination by the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, that there has been a failure to comply with the terms of this clause and that wages lost as a result  <br> of the violations are due to service employees or that other monetary relief is appropriate. If the Contracting Officer or the Administrator, upon final order of the Secretary, finds that the Contractor has failed to provide a list of the names of service employees working under the contract, the Contracting Officer may, in his or her discretion, or upon request by the Administrator, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of the  <br> payment of contract funds until such time as the list is provided to the Contracting Officer. <br>  <br> (l) Subcontracts. In every subcontract over the simplified acquisition threshold entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the Contractor shall include a provision that  <br> ensures- <br>  <br> (1) That each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (c) of this clause with respect to the service employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor Contractor and its subcontractors; <br>  <br> (2) That the subcontractor will provide the Contractor with the information about the service employees of the subcontractor needed by the Contractor to comply with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause; and <br>  <br> (3) The recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (f) of this clause. <br>  <br>  <br> (End of clause)   <br>  <br>  <br> 52.252-2      CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)  <br>  <br> This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal  <br> Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to  <br> ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor. <br>      <br> (b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow. <br>     Solicitation: <br>  <br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>             Item No.                  Supplies/Service        Quantity        Unit      Unit price      Amount <br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> 0001............................

<p>7. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>8. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Chad.B.Davis@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>9. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1200 Pacific Time on 11/15/ 2013</p>

<p>The Government will evaluate price to determine the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Completeness: All information required by the solicitation has been submitted and is accurate.</p>
<p>&bull; Reasonableness: The Government will conduct a price analysis to determine whether the proposed prices are fair and reasonable. This determination may be accomplished by one or more of the techniques set forth in FAR 15.404-1(a)(b)(2).</p>

The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives USTDA the greatest confidence that it will best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical approach and/or superior past performance of the higher priced offeror outweighs the cost difference. The Contracting Officer will make an integrated assessment based on the evaluation factors described above.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />0<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Central Venous Catheters. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong></p>
<p>These Central Venous Catheters products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Central Venous Catheters. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. <strong>The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</strong> The QSL for Central Venous Catheters will be established approximately February 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Central Venous Catheters. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Central Venous Catheters.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Central Venous Catheters. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,036,176.66. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Eighty-five product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the eighty-five product groups, eighty-four represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. Of those eighty-four, six items are considered the requirements for addition to the QSL and account for 52.1% ($539,929.62) of the total volume in sales ($1,036,176.66). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />Central Venous Catheters requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification.

Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

If a sensitive test or visit is scheduled during the dates provided, the Counterintelligence Office will inform the Contractor whether the work/visit may take place. Employees will not be allowed on Post until verification process is complete. Once verification has been received, the Counterintelligence Office is responsible to provide the Protocol Office the following information for badge preparation: Name, Company and Point-of-Contact.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>New or in good condition- initial acceptance will be at the discretion of the acceptor during the delivery. All items required must be fully functional, present, and compatible as required by the SOW. <BR> <BR>Monthly delivery for one year. <BR> <BR>

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.

<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF NEED (Statement of Work) FOR SUPPLY OR SERVICE<br />Transfer of Fuel From NOAA Ship McArthur II<br />Transfer of Fuel From NOAA Ship Ka'imimoana</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE:</p>
<p>NOAA's Marine Operations Center - Pacific (MOC-P) would like to transfer marine diesel from inactive National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) ships McArthur II and Ka'imimoana to operating NOAA public ships. The McArthur II has 88,000 gallons and the Ka'imimoana has 68,000 gallons of transferable fuel remaining. Fuel from the McArthur II will be removed first. The ships providing and receiving the fuel shall be moored at the NOAA's Marine Operations Center - Pacific (MOC-P) facility in Newport, Oregon.</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>TASK 1: TRANSFER OF FUEL:<br /><br />There is about 300 feet of distance between the source and recipient fuel hookups. The source ship has a 4" camlock fitting and can pump off at a maximum of 90 gallons/minute. The contractor must provide a truck and all the hose and connections required to receive the fuel and forward it to the receiving ship. Fuel trucks and equipment can be staged on the pier supporting the ships though necessary precautions must be taken to ensure fuel is not spilled into the adjacent marine environment. Multiple transfers shall be required, each involving an estimated 12,000-50,000 gallons, occurring through the remainder of Fiscal Year 14 (ending Sept. 30, 2014). The total number of gallons to be transferred is about 136,000 gallons. The contractor is to be appropriately certified by the USCG for over water transfers and provide qualified personnel for pumping fuel over marine water to and from ships for the state of Oregon.</p>
<p>TASK 2: POLISHING OF FUEL:<br /><br />The fuel is to be polished as it is transferred. Fuel polishing is the removal of water, sediment, non-combustible particulate matter and microbial contamination below levels stated in ASTM D975 (Standard Specification for Diesel Fuel Oils) while re-suspending combustible particulate matter to maintain ASTM standards for BTU value, lubricity, and Cetane.</p>
<p>The primary difference between fuel polishing and fuel filtration is that fuel polishing acknowledges that fuel itself can degrade and cause solids. Fuel filters simply pull the solids out because they plug up filters whereas fuel polishers break down the combustible solids so that the fuel stays within the industry specifications.</p>
<p><br />DELIVERABLE SCHEDULE:</p>
<p>1) Transfer as above an estimated 50,000 gallons on or about 08-JAN-2014.<br />2) Transfer as above an estimated 40,000 gallons on or about 13-FEB-2014.<br />3) Transfer as above an estimated 34,000 gallons on or about 20-FEB-2014.<br />Transfer as above an estimated 12,000 gallons on or about 11-MAR-2014.</p>

For the purpose of award, the Government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 Technical Acceptability (Pass/Fail)<br /><br />To be technically acceptable each item must match the National Stock Number (NSN) and Part Number (P/N) to the items listed in the attached schedule; manufactured new and traceable to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Traceability means the awardee must be able to show clear, documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part from the OEM to the final vendor. Reconditioned or used materials are not acceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 Cost/Price</p>
<p>The Government may select the source based upon a best value evaluation of the offeror's technical acceptability and price.</p>
<p>Past performance shall be viewed as a responsibility determination. In the event two or more technically acceptable offerors bid an identical total price, the Contracting Officer may evaluate responsibility of the contractor by seeking relevant performance information through sources such AMMIS inventory system at the Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center and records posted on Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Retrieval System (PPRS), or other government data bases and other sources that are available. If an offeror has limited or no record of relevant past performance, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably but rather receive a neutral rating.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under United States personal services contracts (USPSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-1</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI conducts programming in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and targeted areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, as well as in Karachi and southern Punjab.</p>
<p>In FATA/KP, the Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) program supports the Government of Pakistan's development efforts to better integrate FATA into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan.  PTI engages the Government of Pakistan's FATA Secretariat, Political Agents, as well as the FATA's tribes in participatory processes to identify community priorities and address some of the region's most immediate needs. The FS and its representative Agency structures, and the KP provincial and district government constitute the key interlocutors within the GoP for this program.</p>
<p>PTI works to counter violent extremism in targeted neighborhoods of Karachi and select districts of Southern Punjab that have been identified as Mission priorities. These activities fall under the wider Pakistan Expanded Regional Stabilization Initiative (PERSI), which aims to promote security and stability; counter violent extremism; and help build a foundation for longer-term economic, political and social development.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), manages an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  Activities range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and drinking water supply schemes, repairs to schools, roads, and flood walls, and agricultural terraces.  Sociocultural and livelihood activities are also undertaken where they have the support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  In addition, the program undertakes media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak) Regional Team, and is based in Islamabad, Pakistan as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Pakistan country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other bilateral donors, international organizations, and local government officials.  The Country Representative will oversee a team of at least 4 USPSCs, several national staff, and a significant number of implementing partner staff in at least 7 different locations across the country, including Islamabad, Peshawar, Karachi, and Lahore.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, strong analytical and organizational skills, the exercise of good judgment and personal responsibility, and ability to communicate with a variety of interlocutors.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting his/her supervisor in responding to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The barracks was originally built in the year 1961 and last renovated in 1988. Cadets are currently housed in the existing barracks, which do not meet current Army standards. They do not meet a typical training barracks 2+2 configuration. The barracks are sub-standard; do not provide sufficient square footage. The barracks is also deficient in required power, communications, security and utilities. Ventilation is not in compliance with building codes and mold exists in the barracks presenting a continual health risk to the Cadets. The current barracks does not provide enough female latrines to accommodate the 16% female population.    <br>    The current HVAC, fire suppression, and infrastructure deficiencies negatively impact the health and security and safety of the Cadets. There is no air conditioning in the barracks. The current infrastructure will require substantial upgrades to meet current health, safety and security codes and requirements.    <br>        <br>

<DESC><strong>THIS PROJECT IS ADVERTISED ON A FULL AND OPEN BASIS<br />BIDS ARE DUE AT THE TIME AND PLACE IDENTIFIED&nbsp;IN THE SOLICITATION</strong><br /><br />Project Details: The project will construct a drop structure in the Las Vegas Wash channel downstream of the Lake Las Vegas Dam. This structure is the fourth of a proposed eight drop structures to control channel erosion of the Las Vegas Wash Channel due to the lowering Lake Mead Water levels. <br />The scope of this project is limited to building a new drop structure in the channel with an active stream. There is no mechanism to stop the channel flow so a diversion plan must be prepared and submitted showing experience with this type of very specific work elements. Sequenced construction in the channel will be necessary while maintaining channel flows at all times. The drop structure is comprised of two sheet pile walls with a concrete cap and Class 6 Riprap placed before in and at the toe of the structure. The access to the site is limited to a dirt access road that needs improvement and continuous maintenance.
<p>SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES: <br />o Schedule A - Major Items<br />o Earthwork Geotextile (5,500 square yards)<br />o Sheet Piles In Place (1,800 square yards)<br />o Reinforcing Steel (6,500 lbs)<br />o Structural Concrete (215 cubic yards)</p>
<p>IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT: Contractor is responsible for water diversion design and shall submit a water diversion plan for approval by the COE and Lake Mead. The daily base flow is expected to be approximately 350 cfs and there should be protective measures to handle flows from storm events. An average storm event can produce a storm spike from 1,000 to 1,500 cfs while larger events can produce floods exceeding 10,000 cfs.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in late October, 2013. Construction is anticipated to occur from December, 2013 to July, 2014. The contracting range for this project is between $2 million and $5 million.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Park Service (NPS) intends to issue a Prospectus for a new business opportunity at Assateague Island National Seashore within the next 30 days. This Prospectus will solicit proposals to provide equipment rentals, food and beverage, merchandise, and other services within Assateague Island National Seashore's Maryland district. Once the Prospectus has opened for review, there will be a 90 day period for bidders to respond.</p>
<p>The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR Part 51, has determined that the previous Concessioner is not a preferred Offeror for the Contract to be awarded. The term of the new Concession Contract will be for approximately ten years. The exact length of the term will be determined when the effective date is determined, at the time of Contract execution.</p>
<p>The NPS plans to release the Prospectus in November, with an anticipated award in mid spring 2014. A site visit will be held on Thursday, November 21, 2013 beginning at 10:00 am. The site visit will allow all interested parties to visit the concession facilities. Each interested entity may bring up to three (3) attendees. Parties who have notified the Park after the initial announcement are asked to reconfirm their attendance. The NPS may host an additional site visit associated with this business opportunity later in the fall.</p>
<p>Parties interested in attending the site visit on November 21 must RSVP to Concession Specialist Debbie Morlock via email (Debbie_Morlock@nps.gov) by 4:00 pm Eastern Standard Time, Tuesday, November 19, 2013. The site visit will start at the Assateague Island National Seashore Ranger Station located in the Maryland district, on the west side of Bayberry Drive, beyond the entrance station. The NPS will provide information for the site visit to those who respond in a timely manner. Please include the names of those who will attend in your email. If you would like to receive information about the business opportunity, but not attend the site visit, please contact Debbie Morlock to be placed on a contact list.</p>
<p>This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation, prospectus, or Request for Proposal (RFP). Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future prospectus. When the prospectus is released, it will be synopsized and posted officially on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) and on the NPS Commercial Services website at http://cs.inside.nps.gov/Pages/CommercialServices.aspx. It is the responsibility of the potential offeror to monitor these sites for additional information.</p>

NATEC requires CETS in support of the C-130, AH-1W, P-3, H-46, H-60, EA-6B, and F-18, series aircraft systems and sub-systems. It is essential that the listed aircraft be mission-ready and able to perform their military tasking with the minimum possible failures or faults. The Government is performing market research in order to determine if small businesses possess the capability to execute the requirements within this acquisition. Respondents need to indicate all small business designations. Interested business firms who meet the capability requirements identified in this notice are requested to reply to this notice with a response. Based upon small business responses received, consideration will be given to defining what part of the acquisition, if any; will be set-aside for small business competition.</p>

This sources sought synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal (RFP), request for quote, invitation for bid, nor does it in any way restrict the Government to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government is not liable for any costs incurred by the contractor in response to this synopsis, and therefore, will not compensate any contractor for work performed in response to this synopsis.
<p><br />The 766th Specialized Contracting Squadron is conducting market research to determine potential sources for Audio Visual Support Services for Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS) located in Honolulu Hawaii. The current contract providing these services expires February 2014 and APCSS requires follow-on Audio Visual support in preparation for evaluations of conferences, workshops, courses and events offered by APCSS.<br /><br />APCSS provides a focal point where national officials, decision makers, and policy makers can gather to exchange ideas, explore pressing issues and achieve a greater understanding of the challenges that shape the security environment of the Asia-Pacific region.<br /><br />The Audio Visual Support Services includes graphic arts, audiovisual, Video Teleconferencing (VTC) services, and information technology services to include systems/network management and seminar room support (help desk) and technical support services as specified in the attached drafted Performance Work Statement (PWS). <br /><br />The RFI encompasses continued audiovisual support for APCSS, necessary to sustain their mission. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract for Audio Visual Support Services. The period of performance for each year is up to 12 months for contract award and the contract will cover a base year and one option year.<br /><br />This announcement requests statements of Capabilities outlining specific relevant experience and/or approach, as appropriate in satisfying the drafted performance work statement.<br /><br />Interested parties are requested to submit their Statement of Capabilities in the form of a White Paper, a maximum of 5 single-sided pages with text no less than 12 point font (Arial or Times New Roman) and a minimum of one-inch margins in Microsoft&reg; Word, Adobe&reg; PDF or compatible format.

The small business standard is $7 million. Because this requirement is 8(a) competitive, there would be no other considerations for the company category. Those desiring to do business with the Air Force must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/)<br /><br />2. Section B - Background. Brief history highlighting past relevant experience providing Audio Visual (AV) Support Services.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>In recent years, CBP has observed an increasing number of criminal organizations using sophisticated forms to avoid detection and<span style="COLOR: black"> to further conceal their activities both on land and in the air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Calexico Station currently lacks the capability to efficiently monitor the criminal organizations and terrorists engaging in or planning illicit activities along the U.S. border.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Current Thermal Cameras are insufficient, outdated, and often fail; land units are unable to exploit the use of new camera technology due to there being none.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, Calexico Station requests to modernize and reinforce its current capabilities based on the criminal organizations methods being used to evade Border Patrol enforcement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently, Calexico Station lacks current Thermal Camera equipment to detect, disrupt, degrade and dismantle Ultra Lite Aircraft operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;These capabilities will allow the Calexico Station to effectively and efficiently identify and intercept any illegal ULA traffic generated along the Calexico Station's area of responsibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Z-500 camera system from General Dynamics is currently the only system that is compatible with the Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) software being used at the Calexico Station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's the only Thermal imager that is capable of being mounted on existing CBP owned Pan<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&amp; Tilts (P&amp;Ts), and interoperate with existing CBP control systems without requiring hardware or software redesigns, and/or, modifications of the current CBP configuration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The use of any other camera system would unequivocally risk the need of continuity of service with another type of camera that is not from General Dynamics. Hardware or software redesigns and/or modification of the current CBP configuration would be a great cost to the Agency during this sequester period.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's the United States Customs and Border Protection intent to purchase the Z-500 camera system from General Dynamics.&nbsp; Purchase and subsequent use of this equipment will benefit all of the Calexico Station's assets as well as intelligence agents, and ultimately the Sector as information is analyzed, linked and pushed out once such traffic is recorded on camera. <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>

<DESC>This is a limited sources justification for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 8.405-6(a)(B), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is SAQMMA14F0052. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-58. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 611430 with a small business size standard of $10 million dollars. This requirement is a Small Business set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit quotes.
<p>The Department of State requires the following: <br />The mission of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) is to provide a safe, secure environment for the conduct of US diplomacy. DS is the law enforcement and security bureau/entity for the US Department of State. In furtherance of this mission, one of the goals of the DS Training Center (DSTC) is to provide training to Foreign Service National Investigators (FSNIs) to enhance their ability to perform their duties and responsibilities. All FSNIs are locally hired investigators who work directly for the Regional Security Office (RSO).</p>
<p>The FSNI Basic Course (OT-510) is a 12 day class, with a maximum of 24 students, that serves as introductory training for newly hired FSNIs. It is usually offered three or four times per fiscal year. The FSNI In Service Course (OT-515) is a 5 day class, with a maximum of 24 students, that provides advanced training for FSNIs that have been so employed for at least 5 years. It is usually offered two to three times per fiscal year. The In Service course provides new training that builds upon skills the FSNIs learned in the Basic course. Both courses could be held more or less often depending upon the Department's needs. Curriculum updates may lengthen or shorten the currently proposed training segments. All training is conducted at the Diplomatic Security Training Center (DSTC) in Dunn Loring, VA, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>The DSTC has an immediate and ongoing need to prepare FSNIs from posts around the world to effectively interview and investigate Locally Employed Staff (LES) and Third Country Nationals (TCNs). These interviews cover pre-employment background investigations, security certifications, periodic re-certifications, and investigations of criminal and security incidents. FSNIs primarily interview foreign nationals and not US Government employees or family members that are US citizens with national security clearances. Therefore, this training needs to take into account the various factors affecting these interviews such as applicable local laws, State Department regulations, and behavioral science that incorporate the impact of cultural differences due to the local or regional customs, practices, and religious and political influences.<br />(See attached Statement of Work)</p>
<p><br />In addition to providing pricing for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation. In this requirement a letter of authorization from the reseller demonstrating your firm is an active authorized reseller of the product required must be included with all offers, only offers from the manufacturer or authorized resellers as demonstrated by an official letter from manufacturer or other proof as available will be required to be included with submission to be considered for this opportunity. Also, please provide pictures of the products being requested for this requirement.</p>
<p>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to FAR 4.1102 and other applicable regulations and guidelines. Information can be found at www.sam.gov.<br />All Quotes must be valid for 30 days from the closing date for this solicitation. No exceptions or qualifications.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 21; 975 Kirman Ave., Reno, NV 89502

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Justification and approval for Other than Full and Open Competition for 88 ARJO Huntleigh Patient Transfer Overhead Tracks for the VA Sierra Nevada Healthcare Facility located at 975 Kirman Ave, Reno, NV 89502.

4.    Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source (41 USC 253 (c) (1)).  

5.    Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   ARJO Huntleigh is the only authorized vendor that can perform maintenance and service for the Maxisky Patient Lifts.  ARJO Huntleigh is the manufacturer, and the only source for firmware updates, compatible repair parts, and tools for calibration of this equipment.  Firmware updates are regulated and proprietary and cannot be redistributed legally. Any unauthorized maintenance or modification to the system would have to be at the VA's risk, without any sanction from Cataract; therefore placing all liability on the VA.  Alcon is the only vendor that can meet statement of work for this specific repair.  There is no competition for this repair and must be facilitated by ARJO Huntleigh.

ARJO Huntleigh is the only authorized vendor that can perform maintenance and service for the Maxisky Patient Lifts.  ARJO Huntleigh is the manufacturer, and the only source for compatible repair parts, and tools for calibration of this equipment.  There is no competition for this repair and must be facilitated by ARJO Huntleigh.

7.
