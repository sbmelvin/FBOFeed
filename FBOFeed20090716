<DESC>ESU's goal is to manage AF core Services, within the AFNetOps community to reduce training, maintenance costs, and increase operational flexibility and capacity to the warfighter.
ESU will support administration, monitoring, management, and configuration control of AF core services at OCONUS and CONUS sites across the Air Force Enterprise by centralizing the Air force, Air force Reserve and Air National Guard Core Service management tools to four Enterprise Service Unit locations, 2 CONUS and 2 OCONUS. The Core Service management tools will be standardized at the same time they are centralized to allow for Disaster Recovery (DR), Continuity of Operations (COOP) and Situational Awareness.  Through, centralizing and standardizing the Core Service management toolsets to the ESU locations, existing management capabilities will be transferred from the base level to the ESUs.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) on a Fixed Price Basis for environmental testing services at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) McAdoo Superfund site located in McAdoo Pennsylvania. This environmental testing is an integral part of a comprehensive CDC public health response investigating the occurrence, trends, and associated risk factors of PV and other MyeloProliferative Diseases (MPDs) not only in the cluster area in Pennsylvania but also on a national level. The data collected by CDC as a result of this work will allow the Agency to better respond to cancer clusters with suspected environmental origins. In addition, CDC's understanding of the etiology of MPDs and other hematological cancers will be greatly enhanced leading to improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these illnesses. The PA DEP is the only organization that possesses and/or has access to the required data. Some of the required data has already been collected by PA DEP. In addition, the results of past environmental testing performed by PA DEP must be reviewed and evaluated in order to devise an effective testing strategy for the McAdoo site. PA DEP has access to many of the areas identified for testing due to existing relationships with local businesses and property owners and its status as a state agency. The North American Industry Classification Code is 541620. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but all replies received within 15 days of publication will be considered. A determination not to compete based on responses received, and to proceed with a noncompetitive award is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to purchase a series of proto-qualification shock tests of PadAbort 1 (PA1) designs from National Technical Systems (NTS). NTS has performedsignificant shock test levels with PA1 components, and has a unique understanding of thePA1 environments.  NTS has performed testing of development flight instrumentationcomponents such as the high speed camera mount.  These parts are of similar size,complexity, and shock levels to the mortar bracket assemblies.	NTS has testingtechniques and infrastructure already in place to perform these kinds of tests, withsimilar sized articles, and similar testing levels.  Having this past performance historyand infrastructure will enable NTS to setup, complete and report out on these tests in anefficient and expedited manner.  NTS is the industry leader in terms of pyrotechnic shocktest services for the aerospace community which provides a high degree of confidence thattest objectives will be met.The testing to be completed is a series of proto-qualification shock tests of PA1 designsto establish that these designs are adequate for the PA1 mission, and can withstandestablished shock proto-qualification levels.  The components under test are 2 mortarsand their corresponding mounting brackets, including pyrotechnic gas-generator devices,one which extracts a drogue chute and the other for a main chute pilot. The drogue chute mortar is used in 2 places, each extracting a drogue chute whichstabilizes the vehicle before main chute deployment. The drogue mortar brackets weigh inexcess of 180 lbs with the required adapter plate, and have hundreds of structural parts. The drogue and/or mortar components under test fundamentally consist of a slider plate,a mounting bracket, mortar canister and gas generator.	This assembly is attached to aprovided adapter plate which mimics the flight vehicle interface.  These chute deploymentdevices are located in close proximity to a) launch abort system (LAS) retention andrelease (R&R) 1.5in pyrotechnic frangible nuts which produce significant shock during LASjettison of the PA1 mission, and b) strap-cutters which are used to cut away the droguechutes before main chutes deploy.  These shock sources have been quantified, and areconsidered an extreme environment.  The mortar systems components must survive thoseshock events such that the chute system is able to recover the PA1 vehicle.  Failure ofmore than 1 chute mortar on PA1 will likely result in a complete loss of the PA1 vehicle.The pilot devices and bracketry are used in 3 places on the PA1 vehicle and each extractsa main chute. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and 13.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon July 21, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Quotes and/or proposals should be received no later than COB July 21, 2008.Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Voorheesville, New York that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 1,180 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space and 9 parking spaces.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 1,125  to 1,180 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for a 10 year term.  The space must be available for occupancy September 1, 2009.  The delineated area is within an area bounded on North by New York State Route 20; on the East by New York State Route 85; on the South by New York State Route 443; on the West by New York State Route 146. This space must have easy access to primary roads. 

Other applicable requirements include:

	Space must be contiguous on a single floor.
	Doors must be capable of locking with agency-controlled keys.
	Parking lot must be well lighted.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>The intent of this contract is to secure services for mechanical treatment of 150 acres of vegetation to remove ladder fuels and reduce the continuity of fuels adjacent to an urban interface community.  Vegetation consists of young to mature mountain mahogany, sagebrush, bitterbrush, manzanita, and ceanothus.  Some units have areas of naturally regenerated conifer saplings that range from 4-20 ft in height. Vegetation to be treated will require cutting, chipping, shredding and mulching.

The CABLE is homeported in Guam; therefore, the availability is planned to be accomplished in Guam. In preparation for that availability and due to the extensive amount of material that is required, MSC plans to issue a contract for the procurement of long-lead time material (LLTM) in support of the USS FRANK CABLE CIVMOD. The contract will be issued sole-source to Guam Shipyards under a J&A for work and material relating to ship availabilities. The RFP for the LLTM is expected to be released by the end of July or early August 2009.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The objective of the acquisition is to provide two equipment upgrades in the Flow Cytometry Core Facility of the Experimental Immunology Branch (EIB), CCR, NCI:  <br /> <br />1.)  Special Order Laser Upgrades of an existing BD Biosciences FACSAria II Flow Cytometer/Cell Sorter and <br />2)  Replacement of existing obsolete equipment with a Special Order 6-Laser BD Biosciences FACSAria II Flow Cytometer/Cell Sorter.  <br />The EIB is proposing to procure the Laser Upgrade of BD FACSAria SN# P22300031 from BD Biosciences because, as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), BD Biosciences is the only known vendor that can perform these modifications on an existing BD Biosciences instrument and meet the specifications as described below.</p>
<p>This requisition is for extensive modifications to an existing instrument to upgrade the laser delivery system of that instrument.  The upgrade involves replacing the existing lasers on the instrument with higher power lasers that are completely compatible with the fiber optics laser light delivery and fluorescent light collect systems in the instrument.  This optical system is a fundamental component of the instrument.  Only the OEM can perform the upgrade in a way that maintains full integration with OEM optical system and the OEM computer control hardware and software.  Only the OEM can provide the upgrade in a way that provides for complete maintenance coverage of the entire system by the OEM. (Specifications stated below.)</p>
<p>The EIB is proposing to procure the new 6-Laser Flow Cytometer/Cell Sorter from BD Biosciences because The BD Biosciences FACSAria II flow cytometer/cell sorter is the only known available system that provides all the analytical and cell sorting capabilities as described below. Further, the BD FACSAria II has several unique capabilities required for support of existing research projects in our core facility.  Finally, only the BD FACSAria II provides for uninterrupted continuity of research and immediate compatibility with existing software that is under development.</p>
<p>BD Biosciences has 5 local service engineers trained on the BD FACSAria II, more than any other known vendor. This capability is required for minimizing down time and is critically important due to the nature of the work in the EIB core facility.</p>

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

LMB is studying the assembly of the spore coat, a proteinaceous shell that encapsulates spores of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, as a model system for understanding how the assembly of supramolecular structures will contribute to cellular morphogenesis. Live cell imaging of morphologically altered cells and measurement of protein localization on curved membrane surfaces will reveal if membrane curvature constitutes a widely conserved mechanism that drives protein localization. 

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority 

Statute: This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501(a)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(2) For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply. 

 No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy   agency need.  

Justification:  

The equipment is required for time-lapse investigation of bacterial development studied in the CCR Fluorescence Imaging Facility in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB). The DeltaVision CORE Live Cell Imaging System is designed for deconvolution, a mathematical treatment to collect stray light and restore contrast and resolution which is typically lost in standard microscope systems. Deconvolution is not an added on function, but an integral part of the system, making it the industry standard in deconvolution microscopy. The restorative deconvolution algorithm designed specifically for the Applied Precision microscope setup is unavailable with other systems which typically use a generic deconvolution algorithm, regardless of the type of microscope setup. No other vendors offer an optimized, designed from the ground up, system developed expressly for deconvolution microscopy.

Salient Characteristics for DeltaVision CORE Live Cell Imaging System:

	Software controlled Xenon 250W lamp which allows for long exposures

	Less than 0.2msecs open/close Excitation Shutter

	Swing enabled Fiber Optic module with Photo Sensor to measure light intensity delivered to each individual image

	Optical Axis Integration (OAI) using single continuous sweep in the Z plane to collect and image data to create 3D projection

	 NanoMotion III Flexure Stage providing 10nm precision in the XY dimension and 4nm in the Z dimension allowing Multi point visiting over a 1 x 2 area

	Camera imaging chip  placed at the intermediate focal plane through the side-port of the microscope with no intermediate optics to degrade the image

	Environmental chamber which allows the internal components of the microscope to be at the same temperature as the sample

	Hand selected Objectives

	Options for adding a QLM laser module (up to Four lasers) for FRAP, Act GFP and acceptor bleaching FRET, a TIRF module and a Multiplex Wavelength module

	Custom restorative deconvolution algorithm designed specifically for microscope setup, not generic deconvolution algorithm

The work to be performed is as follows: Completion of the second part of a two-phase effort that began in 2008. Following completion of error estimation, this effort will involve statistical inference at a given level of significance about whether a specific year is the hottest or coldest between year Y1 and year Y2, at scales of month, season and year. The inference will also be made as for whether one year is hotter or colder than another year with a specific p-value. The completion of phase 1 and 2 of this project along with operational implementation will make it possible to state with a given probability of confidence that one year is warmer or colder than another. Software for calculating uncertainty estimates will be delivered to NCDC for integration into established ingest and processing routines. This software will fulfill the requirement that, following the collection and quality control of daily temperature observations and integration into the United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) data set, national average temperatures and error estimates can be calculated to quantify the extent to which one particular year is warmer or colder than another for the U.S. as a whole.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS

The US EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA) to procure subscriptions to the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC) under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 and FAR 6.302-5 in support of its responsibilities under HSPD-7 and Sections 1433 ? 1435 of the Safe Drinking Water Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES. 
The resultant contract will consist of a twelve month base period and three (3) twelve month option periods.  The maximum potential for the base period is $3 million and is $2 million for each individual option period.  The WaterISAC is a one-of-a-kind, subscription based resource which serves as a clearinghouse for government and private information that helps the subscribers identify risks, prepare for emergencies and secure the nation's critical water infrastructure.  The WaterISAC provides users with sensitive threat information, emergency response tools, and the ability to network with the community of peers. Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) are confidential venues for sharing security vulnerabilities and solutions within an industry.  The WaterISAC is a forum to keep drinking water and wastewater utility managers informed about potential risks to the nation's water infrastructure from contamination, terrorism and cyber threats.
 In addition, WaterISAC is used to help utilities respond to and recover from all hazards.  The WaterISAC links members through a secure online portal. The subscriber base includes water utilities and state and federal agencies dealing with security, law enforcement, intelligence, the environment and public health.  The WaterISAC, an ISAC for drinking water and wastewater systems, was created by AMWA in 2002.  AMWA?s WaterISAC is the only known source able to satisfy the Government?s requirements because their service provides access to an exclusive community and network for water security information sharing and analysis through a secure portal. 
 Additionally, information sharing capabilities must be coordinated between an established, trusted group of utilities and stakeholders and administered by a trusted sector partner with an existing relationship and credibility with the water sector. Furthermore, Section 430 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 states that $2,000,000 is to be provided from the EPA?s ?Environmental Programs and Management? account to the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center/Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies.
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability by responding to the office identified above. The capability statement should address the interested party?s capability to provide not only its clearinghouse capabilities, ability to access, analyze, and disseminate the necessary information, and its status as a trusted sector partner with an existing relationship and credibility with the water sector.  This documentation must be received by July 31, 2009 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
 Interested parties should submit a written response to David Plagge by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail plagge.david@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC><p>Pre-solicitation Notice for Phase III: Optimal Control Theory Uncertainty for Sustainable Environmental Management In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) , Sustainable Technology Division (STD) located in Cincinnati, OH is seeking to purchase a report on Optimal Control Theory Uncertainty for Sustainable Environmental Management. Background: The EPA\ORD\NRMRL\STD, has an interest to further the research and development as well as, implementation of those areas supporting and addressing areas of sustainability, in order to maintain and/or improve environmental quality. Past research pertaining to sustainability lacks the/a method(s) from an environmental quality standpoint of applications for fundamental underlying theory. This lack has illustrated a major obstacle to understanding, and/or being able to determine directions for immediate or future implementation of sustainability. The work described herein involves the further development of mathematical model(s) that have been determined under Phase I and Phase II in this research area. In developing this/these models, and in order to determine their credibility, the model(s) are applied to various scenarios of application to understand the impact and usefulness for future predictions of behavior under different circumstances. The models include looking at population, vegetation, climate, waste, and economic impacts by developing theoretical approaches that may lead to future work by STD within this field of research. Phase I, (previous work) researched the development of a fundamental simulated food-web model useful for sustainability studies and the application of &ldquo;Optimal Control Theory&rdquo; concept. By developing the concept into a valuable tool in which data can be incorporated to determine scenarios useful for forecasting the direction of Sustainable Environmental Management. Phase II, (previous work) evolved from the Phase I research and it involved the construction of optimal control strategy algorithms for incorporation in a simulated food-web model; and a mathematical computer algorithm using optimal control theory to manage a simulated ecological-economic-social model. This application of the &ldquo;Optimal Control Theory&rdquo;, included scenarios for population growth and resource consumption increases, resource consumption restrictions and economic strategies for implementing the restrictions. Phase III is intended to address two known gaps in the previous work: to investigate uncertainty (at a greater depth) and to incorporate an energy aspect. Scope of Work: A sophisticated mathematical model incorporating a model ecosystem along with a simplified economy and a human population with a rudimentary industrial sector and the sketch of a legal system has been developed. This development occurred partly in-house at the EPA and partly through two previous Purchase Orders. The mathematical model also incorporates an optimal control system that aims to maintain the stability of the system under human population and human consumption pressures. Two important assumptions in the mathematical model are: (1) The supply of energy available to the system is ample and constant. (2) That information on the system is accurate, i.e., there is negligible uncertainty. To address these two gaps, the following tasks shall be completed under this purchase order with the aim of addressing these two important areas. The contractor shall start with the already developed mathematical models (provided) from Phases I and II. Description of Tasks: Task 1 The Contractor shall incorporate into the mathematical model, an abstract representation of an economic energy generation sector, which will supply energy to households and private firms, farming, ranching, and industry, under a price-setting macroeconomic representation of the market and human population. The contractor shall adapt an energy theory to develop a method to represent the flow of energy through the model ecosystem and conduct simulated scenarios under different degrees to energy scarcity and energy prices. The contractor shall incorporate the energy generation sector into the macroeconomic model or produce new components within the existing model(s). Task 2 The Contractor shall incorporate &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo; into the mathematical model(s). These various degrees of uncertainty associated with the model(s) and its variables will then determine the next steps in order to conduct analysis. In turn, this information shall be used to establish the degree of confidence in the results obtained from the aforementioned energy scarcity and energy price scenarios. This procurement will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria and will be competed using Full and Open Competition. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about July 31, 2009. This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Interested parties should submit a written request to receive the RFQ to Michael Kreacic at the above address or by fax to 513-487-2107 or by e-mail to kreacic.michael@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the University of California, 200 Medical Plaza, Suite 420, Los Angeles, CA.  

The purpose of this contract is to create a virtual laboratory for health services research that would specifically address womens health issues and would be adaptable to the parameters of other US states.  The initiative will include creation of a coalition of governmental, academic, and private entities within the State of California, to collaboratively provide public access to the databases of their institutions, in order to answer research questions relating to the health and healthcare of women and minorities.  This project will result in a data warehouse containing public use de-identified data files, with documentation that can be accessed using an easy to use interface, and that is available for a wide range of investigations by a broad segment of the research community.  Once developed, the virtual laboratory is intended to serve as a prototype for other state-specific warehouses across the nation.

The UCLA CoE shall serve as the Project Coordinating Center (PCC), and will develop the Virtual Laboratory for Health Services Research.  Activities at the UCLA CoE will include:

Development of a coordinating center at the University of California, Los Angeles, to convene entities who will contribute data and who will have access to databases, to develop an initial plan to make databases available for secondary research through formation of a database warehouse, and to complete an initial process evaluation for the purpose of making replication of the process possible in other states.

Development of a coalition of experts from around California representing leaders in health services research from state and local governments, health plans, healthcare provider groups and academia who have access to and in-depth knowledge about their respective institutional databases, have decision-making authority, and who will agree to help in the development of the proposed database warehouse.  The development of this coalition will include the creation of key across data set demographic and clinical variables with transparent web-based uniform documentation, and a seamless, well organized web-based interface for the data warehouse that will offer a cost efficient resource for womens health researchers.

Within 4-5 months of receipt of funding for the project convene a 2-day meeting to develop a plan for creating a database warehouse.  This plan will be informed by previously successful multicenter database analysis.  A critical final step will be to determine the type of research questions that could be answered by the proposed data warehouse with an eye toward creating the needed information to conduct comparative effectiveness research and studies of health and health care disparities across a wide array of health systems and diverse populations.  The process of negotiating the basis for the multicenter database warehouse will be documented using qualitative research methods. 

If possible, the PCC will conduct a small pilot study to test the functionality of this virtual lab.

Reports:  Three 2-page interim reports, a 15-20 page Final Report, and a 2-page Executive Summary will be developed and submitted to AHRQ.  The three interim reports will document the progress of the project to date.  The final report will document the process with particular attention to decisions about the structure and content of the data warehouse, which will afford AHRQ the opportunity to examine the relative cost effectiveness of each level of the data project, as well as to examine the feasibility of replicating the process in other states.    It would also allow AHRQ to present this information to potential funding partners who might be interested in particular aspects of the database.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The United States Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & LethalityContracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000 on behalf of the Office of Project Manager  Shoulder Fired Weapons, intends to issue a competitive solicitation, for immediate procurement of a Cannon Caliber Training System for the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Multi-Role Anti-Armor Anti- Personnel Weapon System (MAAWS). The current MAAWS program is the Non- Developmental Item (NDI) acquisition of the Saab Bofors Dynamics Carl Gustaf 84mm recoilless rifle system. The U.S. Government does not own data rights to the system. USSOCOM has a requirement for a Sub-caliber Training System consisting of a Cannon Caliber round of ammunition and a re-usable adapter to allow firing from the 84mm M3 Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle. The Cannon Caliber round must replicate the trajectory and crosswind behavior of a currently fielded tactical round for ranges up to 300m (Threshold) or 500m (objective). The adapter must allow firing of the cannon caliber round inside of the M3 84mm Carl Gustaf weapon using the existing M3 firing mechanism. The adapter must be adjustable to allow bore-sighting with M3 Carl Gustaf sighting systems including night vision equipment. A barrel life of 10,000 rounds is desirable. When fired, the training system must produce a signature approximating an 84mm round within established noise and blast overpressure limits for training firing. It is desirable that the system require no modification to the M3 Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle. Because the Government does not own data rights to the Carl Gustaf system, potential offerors must request required weapon and ammunition trajectory data from Saab Bofors Dynamics AB, Karlskoga, Sweden. The system must be capable of being rigged for airborne and submersible operations in accordance with existing service procedures. The system must be sufficiently rugged to remain safe, operational and effective following exposure to the rigors normally associated with military training exercises, including air delivery and salt water submersion..  A five-year, Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract, for fiscal years 2010 through 2014, is anticipated for this acquisition. The solicitation will be for the manufacture, assembly, inspection, packaging and delivery, of quantities ranging from 5 - 500 units per year, for the adapter and 200  5000 per year for ammunition.  Bid samples of one (1) adaptor and twenty (20) rounds of ammunition will be required and made part of the evaluation and source selection process. The government reserves the right to procure any, or all, of the items listed above at any time within the contract performance period (FY 2010 to FY 2014). Specific performance requirements and attributes of the Training System will be released as part of the solicitation. A competitive Request for Proposal and Bid Sample will be posted on Fed Biz Opps on or about July 31, 2009.  This date is an estimate and is subject to change/amendment.  Offerors proposals, along with Bid Samples, will be required within sixty (60) days from issue date of the RFP.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Marylou Desseaux, Contract Specialist, Acquisition Center, Building 322, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, email marylou.desseaux@us.army.mil

Solicitation Number: 
Reference-Number- 
Notice Type: 
Sources Sought 
Synopsis: 
Added: 



THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), TO BE USED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BID (IFB) OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH PREPARATION OF ANY RESPONSE TO THIS RFI OR ITS ASSOCIATED INFORMATIONAL PACKAGE.

1. PURPOSE

The United States Mint at Philadelphia is seeking expressions of interest to determine if there are an adequate number of responsible and interested sources who can meet and/or exceed the Government's nominal salient characteristic requirements for the complete removal and replacement of annealing furnace insulation. The information gathered from this notice shall be used for pre-planning purposes only and does not obligate the Government to issue an official requirement for the subject equipment. Furthermore, the Government will not present payment for any information provided in response to this notice, nor will the Government return any data submitted. 

2. PROGRAM PLAN

The standard serviceable life of furnace insulation is approximately ten years, which this equipment approximately is currently.  For this type of application and age, the degradation of insulation can lead to thermal fatigue of the furnace shell; thereby causing leaks and/ or cracking to propagate, ultimately leading to full equipment failure.

In addition, a recent health and safety audit revealed that some of the lining was discolored; which according to sources may be an indicator of degradation of the insulation material.  As per the OEM manual, aging insulation can release ceramic fibers into the system, Refractory ceramic fibers are classified per the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Category 2B - Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans; furthermore, the crystalline silica, which is found in ceramic fiber installations is classified per IARC Category 1 - Carcinogenic to Humans. 





3. TECHNICAL DATA

3.1 Program Objective: 

The United States Mint at Philadelphia is seeking vendors to provide nominal salient characteristic requirements for the complete removal and replacement of annealing furnace insulation.  The insulation work requested entails Furnace side walls, rear/ front walls, and roof to be lined with 8-inches of 8-lb modular refractory ceramic fiber (temperature rating 2300 degrees F).  Modification/ repair of mounting hardware may be included to allow for this work.

3.2 Plan Description

The contractor should provide a description of all aspects of the development plan including all significant assumptions. Explain in detail the scope of work required to meet the performance and schedule.  The information provided in response to this RFI should contain technical information sufficient to provide a clear understanding of the contractor's concepts and performance. Information shall convey significant detail of the proposed concept, including: Proposed Plan, Schedule, Teaming Requirements, U.S. Mint Production Impacts, Government Furnished Information (GFI) / Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Requirements, Projected compliance to applicable Standards, Specifications, and Regulations, Installation/ Removal Labor and Material Cost*. 
*Cost data should be provided in FY09 constant dollars. Use months after contract award as a time basis for cost reporting.  For planning purposes, approximately 720 sq. ft (surface area) of furnace insulation will be removed/ replaced.

3.3 Government Furnished Information

3.3.1 Existing Furnace/ Insulation Information: 
1.	Equipment Description: The rotary retort furnace has a capacity of 4000 lbs/ per hour.  The rating is based on a 265 Lb/ cu. Ft bulk load density of copper, cupro/ nickel, and clad coin blanks taken to a temperature of 1550 degrees F +/- 25 degrees F and soaked at that temperature for a period of (15) minutes.  The furnace is heated by an indirect-fired, natural gas combustion system; using cast HT (35-15) alloy tubes located along both sides of the retort.  The 4000 lb/ hr, 4,100,000 BTU gross design uses (14) firing tubes.
2.	Insulation: the furnace enclosure is internally lined with 8-inches of 8-lb modular refractory ceramic fiber on the walls, ceiling, and floor.  The temperature rating for the insulation is 2300 degrees F.






3.3.2 Safety, Health, Environmental Requirements:
 
As per the OEM manual:
	On equipment insulated with ceramic fiber batts, blocks, or blanket, the user should be aware that ceramic fiber particles can be present in the furnace.  These particles can be a possible hazard to health.  When working in the furnace, use a dust filter, wear properly fitted safety goggles, and wear clothing that covers the body.  Failure to observe these precautions can result in serious skin irritation and possible respiratory problems, which includes cancer.
	It is highly recommended that personnel use disposable coveralls when working with or in close proximity to ceramic fibers, to protect street clothing from accumulating fibers.  If fibers get on the skin, they are more of an irritant than a danger, but the irritation can be very annoying.  To avoid this irritation, personnel involved with ceramic fiber should shower thoroughly if exposed to fiber dust.
	As stated, aging insulation can release ceramic fibers into the system, Refractory ceramic fibers are classified per the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Category 2B - Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans; furthermore, the crystalline silica, which is found in ceramic fiber installations is classified per IARC Category 1 - Carcinogenic to Humans. The industry has recently recommended a now adopted exposure limit of 0.5 fibers/ cc.  However, ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists) has established an exposure limit of 0.2 fibers/ cc.  Since the ACGIH limit is more restrictive and stands as the recognized organization for establishing exposure limits, the more restrictive limit of 0.2 fibers/ cc should be used rather than the 0.5 fibers/cc limit.  Note that almost all areas can exceed this exposure limit, when working with ceramic fiber.  For this reason, it is recommended that an appropriate mask or respirator be used when working with this material.  This recommendation is currently based on prudence, not on verifiable test or government (OSHA) regulations.
	Applicable Standards should include but is not limited to: NFPA 86, Standard for Ovens and Furnaces; NFPA 86C, Standard for Industrial Furnaces Using a Special Processing Atmosphere. The furnace enclosure is considered a confined workspace; as such, reference NIOSH #L-14-162, A Guide To Safety In Confined Spaces and OSHA Confined Space Standard 29 CFR 1910.146.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantage businesses, HUB Zone businesses; veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is being posted for fact finding and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an Invitation for Bid, a Request for Proposal, Solicitation, Request for Quote, or an indication the Government will contract for the items or services herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this source sought. Any response received will not be used as a proposal.

**QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE ENTERTAINED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE**

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) is seeking to identify sources with capabilities and prior experience to develop and build two identical Transconductance Amplifiers for the Electrophysiology Laboratiory, in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health for research purposes in order to study the electrophysiology of defibrillation waveform, duration, and shape; and evaluate these properties effect on efficacy of defibrillation success.  This research supports premarket regulatory efforts for both implanted defibrillators and external defibrillators.  The Transconductance Amplifier will be used on excised animal hearts, and will therefore need to put out sufficient voltage and current for successful defibrillation.  Because a primary goal of our research is to evaluate the effect of waveform shape, the Transconductance Amplifier must accept an input control waveform in the shape of the desired output waveform and then amplify this input control waveform to the specified energy requirements (keeping the duration and shape of the waveform constant



Objective: 

The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of defibrillators; including external defibrillators, automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). The Electrophysiology Laboratory, in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), is frequently called on to evaluate the safety and efficacy of designs for new defibrillators that incorporate unique shocking waveforms. Without the ability to replicate and test these waveforms in a laboratory setting there is no way for the FDA to independently verify claims of safety and efficacy. Additionally, the basic science involved in defibrillation is still not well understood and continues to be a factor in the regulation of defibrillators. The Electrophysiology Lab will also investigate the cellular mechanisms of defibrillation. 

The Transconductance Amplifier will be used to amplify an arbitrary input control waveform to a high current waveform having the same shape and duration as the original voltage control waveform. The amplified arbitrary waveform will be used on excised animal hearts, and will therefore need to be of sufficient voltage and current for successful defibrillation. See Figure 1 below. The input control waveform (5V) will be amplified by a factor of 1 Amp per Volt to produce the output waveform.  

The Contractor may be required to:

a. Design, build and deliver two identical Transconductance Amplifiers with the following technical specifications: 
1.	The gain of the Transconductance Amplifier shall be 1 Amp per Volt.
2.	The Bipolar Output Terminals shall be isolated from ground with a safety disconnect implemented as an electromechanical relay or equivalent.
3.	The maximum output voltage range, referenced to the negative Bipolar Output Terminal, shall be -190 Volts to +190 Volts.
4.	The maximum output current shall vary with the load resistance:
a.	For load resistances from 0 to 38 Ohms the maximum current output shall be limited to 5 Amps.
b.	For load resistances greater than 38 Ohms the maximum current output shall be 190 Volts divided by the load resistance.
5.	Within the specifications for maximum output current (Specification 4) the current output shall follow the voltage input with a tolerance of  2%.
6.	Duration of output waveform at 5A: 500ms or more. 
7.	Minimum number of 5A, square wave pulses, output per minute into a 38 Ohm load (by duration of pulse): 500 at 10ms, 50 at 100 ms, 10 at 500ms
8.	The Bandwidth of the Transconductance Amplifier shall be DC to 1 kHz, or more. 
9.	A BNC Analog Output for monitoring the voltage output of the Transconductance Amplifier. The monitor voltage shall be a linear representation of the voltage on the Bipolar Output Terminals:  +5 Volts shall represent +190 Volts and -5 Volts shall represent -190 Volts.  
10.	A BNC Analog Output for monitoring the current output of the Transconductance Amplifier. The monitor voltage shall be a linear representation of the voltage on the Bipolar Output Terminals:  +5 Volts shall represent +5 Amps and -5 Volts shall represent -5 Amps.
11.	A BNC Digital Input connection to enable the output of device. The Bipolar Output Terminals of the device shall be disconnected from the amplifier unless this enable line goes to a TTL logic low, engaging the electromechanical relays (see specification 2) and connecting the Bipolar Output Terminals to the amplifier. 
12.	A BNC Analog Input connector for arbitrary control waveforms (5V) to be amplified. The input impedance shall be &#8805; 5,000 Ohms.
13.	Operation from AC power 110 volts, 50/60 Hz.
14.	Indicators for proper functioning of the Transconductance Amplifier.
15.	One year of technical support on use and troubleshooting of the HPA via both phone and email.
16.	One year warranty covering repairs for defects in parts and workmanship. The vendor agrees to accept shipment of the units for repair if necessary.

7.	SET ASIDE INFORMATION

Currently, as required by FAR Subpart 19.10, Forest Service Acquisitions <$50,000 for A-E in all above A-E NAICS Codes shall be set-aside for emerging small business (defined as  the annual revenue of a small business).  

For the Forest Service, A-E NAICS Codes 541310 and 541330 Acquisitions  &#8805;$50,000 but <$100,000 must be set aside for small business.  Other A-E Services, including Surveying and Mapping, are available for unrestricted competition (e.g. large businesses 
are eligible). 

WHAT IS THE FOREST SERVICE DOING?

Pursuant to FAR Part 36, the Forest Service is establishing data files for Architect-Engineer (AE) contractors interested in doing work in the Forest Services Eastern Region, which includes the States of, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and West Virginia. The projects awarded will cost less than $100,000 and will fall within one of the NAICS descriptions shown on this notice.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) has provided a substantial increase in funding and project work to the Forest Services Eastern Region. Therefore we are establishing a data file of qualified, interested AE firms so that as approved projects are identified we are positioned to utilize the Short Selection process, as defined in FAR 36.602-5, to relatively quickly and efficiently obtain AE Services.  We also believe the Short AE selection process will improve the competitive opportunity for participation by local firms in the vicinity of the individual project(s).  This is consistent with the ARRA intent. We anticipate the need for a variety of AE services.  Examples of some of the types include, but is not limited to; bridge and large culvert design, low volume road design, design of small warehouses and office rehabs to improved energy usage and safety concerns, design of repairs to small dams and impoundments, design of photovoltaic and other renewable energy systems, design of high efficiency replacement HVAC systems, design of electrical systems and lighting, water and waste water system design, performance of sanitary inspections for water systems and safety inspections for bridges and dams, construction inspection, drafting services, surveying, geotechnical investigation, and environmental (RCRA, CECRLA, CWA, etc.) reviews, inventories, audits and coordination of RCRA and other waste disposal. 

WHAT IS THE SHORT SELECTION PROCESS?

For AE projects with an estimated cost of less than $100,000, agencies may review current date files for eligible AE firms, perform a technical review and evaluation to determine the 3 most highly qualified firms, and have discussions with the 3 firms to determine the best qualified firm for that particular project.  A price proposal will then be requested from the highest rated firm.  If reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm, and so on. The data files will be maintained by State and NAISC code.  The AEs ability to provide licensed professionals in the State where the project is located (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firms geographic proximity and knowledge of the local  area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AEs SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exist.

WHAT DOES MY FIRM NEED TO SUBMIT TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND RECEIVE CONSIDERATION FOR FUTURE AE PROJECTS?

Submit one copy of each of the following Documents for Each State and NAICS code of interest.  Each submission should be in a separate envelope with the State and NAISC clearly marked on the out side of the envelope.  Failure to follow this direction may result in miss filing of your submission. 

1.  Page 1 of this Short Selection Sources Sought Solicitation:  Complete Item 3 and Item 6 (put a check mark by NAICS Code/Description for which you are qualified).

2.  CCR Print Out:  Central Contractor Registration is required for award of federal contracts.   www.ccr.gov  search database for your firm and print out results.**  You must be registered in CCR and accept electronic payments in order to be considered for project work.  

3.  SF330, Part 2:  The entire SF330 is posted for your reference (it includes instructions).  SF330, Part 2 needs to be completed and sent in.  A format for extra pages is posted for use.

4.  Attach to Part 2 of the SF330, a list of the number of licensed professionals and the States of their licensing for each of the Function codes identified in block 9 of the SF330, part 2.

**NOTE:  At this time (FY09), AE firms must be an emerging small business qualified to receive consideration for USDA Forest Service AE contract awards for A-E projects less than $50,000.00. For NAICS codes 54130 and 541330 between $50,000 and $100,000 only small business A-E firms are eligible; large businesses are eligible for projects in all other A-E NAICS codes.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought t help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified 8(a) firms capable of providing Patient Escort Services.  This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  The information from this market research is for planning purposes and initiation of a solicitation to assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561210.

The Clinical Center complex of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a biomedical research hospital located in Bethesda, Maryland.  The facility consists of 234 inpatient beds, 81-day hospital stations, over 20 outpatient clinics, diagnostic and treatment areas, and public waiting areas.  Adjacent to the hospital facilities are research laboratories.  The complex consists of three buildings: the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center (Magnuson Center), the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center and the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF).  Together these three buildings represent approximately 3.5 million square feet of space.  The Magnuson Center is research space and the bottom floors house some large departments that support patient care.  The ACRF is a fourteen-floor structure, which houses outpatient clinics and research laboratories on twelve floors.  The first and second levels of the ACRF houses clinical services including diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine and PET, surgery, transfusion medicine and laboratory medicine.  The Hatfield Center is a seven-story structure with a central large open atrium.  Inpatient units are on levels 1, 3, 5 and 7.  Levels 2, 4, and 6 are interstitial mechanical space except for small clusters of offices.

The Clinical Center is a unique facility in that all patients are on a research protocol and over 50% of patients are from across the country and are often here for extended stays.  The needs of this type of patient population differ from a community or academic medical center that draws from a local based population.  Patients may be more anxious, often they are alone, or do not have as many visitors, or family members for support.  That has made caring for the patient a value that is very highly held in the Clinical Center.  In the delivery of outstanding customer service, the hospital looks to the patient Escort and Messenger Services as one of the team departments along with the other front-line patient care services.  Some of the other departments on this team are: Hospitality Services, Admissions, Phlebotomy, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, and Heart Station, to name a few.  These are the departments that are first touch for our patients early on in the admissions process and they make a lasting impression of the Clinical Center.  From 30-35% of the transport calls responded to are fro patient transport.  This makes it a critical component of the Clinical Centers effort to provide outstanding front-line patient service.

The Clinical Center has a requirement to provide Patient Escort Services with the hospital facility.  The scope of work includes but not limited to: (1) Transport of patients, which range from very sick and incapacitated to patients who are ambulatory but need minor assistance; (2)Transporting clinical specimens, research specimens, blood products, e sized medical oxygen gas cylinders, pharmacy items, patient luggage and some paper products.  The services require twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.  In addition, the services include transporting (pick up and delivery for all locations) medical records Monday through Friday, after 8 AM, weekends and holidays.

The contractor providing the services must have extensive experience in providing Patient Escort Services in a healthcare setting with particular emphasis in working in a research healthcare environment.  

The offerors responses must demonstrate their expertise in ALL of the following items.  Please note that failure to specifically demonstrate capability to provide the required services in your response to this market survey may affect the Governments review of industrys ability to perform the services.  The vendors responses shall be in sufficient detail to allow the Government to assess the capability of your firm.  The vendor response must specifically address each of the following areas:

1.	How do you determine that employees are proficient in speaking and   understanding the English language in the hiring process;
2.	What process do you use for on-the-job training of new employees;
3.	What specific competencies are employees being trained on;
4.	How do you monitor the competencies of the transport employee at the point of service;
5.	How do you hold employees accountable for customer service performance;
6.	do you have any process in place for reviewing the cost efficiency of the contract structure with the client at regular intervals;
7.	How do you utilize an effective staffing structure of full time, part time and on call staff to keep contract costs down;
8.	Describe the role and decision making authority of the on-site Program Manager;
9.	How do you propose to manage the dispatch system and capture data for tracking;

The vendor responses shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in this market survey.  Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted, to this market survey extensive experience with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.

<DESC>RECOVERY  The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of small business organizations to perform this requirement. The applicable NAICS code is 541690 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Sources are sought that possess the capability to design, develop, maintain, operate, and upgrade a web-based science driven nanomaterial registry and the application for more accurate and comprehensive information on the effects of nanomaterials on the environment and human health. Sufficient and accurate characterization of the physicochemical properties of engineered nanomaterials and their interactions with biological systems are fundamental requirements for successful material or device design, and also for understanding and managing the lifecycle risks posed by nanomaterials to the environment, human health and safety. Once the registry is established, minimal information about nanomaterials for biological applications from existing databases will be curated and captured in the registry.

This synopsis has been prepared to test the marketplace and determine if it is feasible to conduct this acquisition as a small business set-aside. The work to be performed is a new requirement. The contract is anticipated to be awarded on November 30, 2009 for a period of three years with three option years. 

The purpose of this program is to establish an authoritative nanomaterial registry, whose primary function is to provide consistent and authoritative information on the biological and environmental interactions of well-characterized nanomaterials, as well as links to associated publications, modeling tools, computational results and manufacturing guidances.  It will provide curated data source and assessment information on the health and environmental effects of well-characterized nanomaterials.  A set of minimal information about nanomaterials (MIAN), ontology, and standards will be developed through a community effort with broad representation to establish the authoritativeness of the registry. Data evaluation criteria, the curation process, and the level of compliance will be established based on the MIAN, ontology, and standards to guide the curation and evaluate the data collected in the registry. 

The intended users of the registry are researchers who develop, characterize or utilize nanomaterials for biological, medical and environmental applications. The established nanomaterial registry will benefit users by providing a mechanism to find all types of data and information about a particular nanomaterial of interest. The nanomaterial registry will provide a mechanism to allow interoperability among databases.

The potential contractor must provide a wide range domain expertise in nanomaterial sciences and technology, research experience, and publication record.  Services include: 1) demonstrated research experience, publication, and understanding of the importance of characterization parameters on nanomaterial-biological interactions and determining the capacity of biological assessment platforms to provide knowledge on the biological activity and toxic potential of nanomaterials;  
2) provide a single, authoritative source that links evaluated data for a particular nanomaterial or class of nanomaterials, from existing public databases; 3) facilitate the efficient search, query, and reporting of the data; 4) make it easy to compare physicochemical data, biological function, environmental fate, in vivo characterization information, and safety and toxicology data, etc. across different laboratories and data sources; 5) facilitate the validation of data and improvement of data quality; 6) facilitate the translation of new nanomaterials for biomedical and environmental applications; 7) facilitate the development of new models, standards, assays and manufacturing methods; 8) provide a forum to engage the community in promoting standards, consistent information, and reliable information for regulatory decisions; 9) be able to organize the nanomaterials research community and foster consensus in the community regarding standards, MIAN and ontology; and 10) registry must collect and provide the following: a description of the curation process, including data evaluation criteria, consistent with the MIAN and Ontology, a metric on the quality or degree of characterization of the curated data, a metric that qualifies the level of equivalence between nanomaterials and/or properties across disparate databases, the curated MIAN.

<p>We are looking for someone with the knowledge and capability as follows.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services and facilities (except as otherwise specified), to perform the following Statement of Work/Specifications.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK/SPECIFICATION</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 (Title III of Pub.L. 98-623, 16 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) Provides the legislative authority necessary to implement, with respect to the United States, the Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program. The AMLR Program, which is managed by the Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division (AERD) at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), provides information to the U.S. delegation to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), part of the Antarctic treaty system.</p>
<p>CCAMLR is an international treaty between 23 nations that seeks to manage Antarctic fisheries with the goal of preserving species diversity and stability of the entire Antarctic marine ecosystem. In keeping with this objective, CCAMLR has designated areas of research that member nations are obligated to pursue. The AMLR Program has identified specific data sets that must be collected to respond to CCAMLR's research directives. In doing so, the AMLR Program supports the U.S. Government's commitment to CCAMLR.</p>
<p>In 1996/97, the AMLR Program, in cooperation with the NSF, began providing logistical support for the NSF field camp at Admiralty Bay, King George Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Within the vicinity of this study area, the AMLR program has a large-area survey grid. The NSF field camp and study area are adjacent to an area where reproductive success and feeding ecology of breeding penguins have been monitored since 1976. Dr Wayne Trivelpiece has directed the predator studies at this NSF site since its inception in 1976, together with Susan G. Trivelpiece, Co-PI.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is conducting a sources sought notice to locate analyst manpower to assist with the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) data analysis and fuel consumption model development.
The AEDT computer tool is a robust, new, comprehensive suite of aviation environmental analysis tools and methodologies intended to provide functionality not available in existing analytical tools, such as assessment of interdependences between aviation-related noise and emissions and analysis of the costs and benefits of proposed actions. 
The long-term goal of AEDT development is to provide a seamless, comprehensive set of tools to address all aspects of noise and emissions.  This effort will require significant levels of data analysis, model development and information exchange performed by proven analysts in the field of aviation noise and emissions modeling. 
The Volpe Center is also developing fuel consumption models for turboprop and piston fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters commonly operated both in the United States and in high-density traffic areas, such as Europe.  These models will work within the AEDT modeling system.  Data to be used by the new turboprop, piston, and helicopter fuel consumption models for fixed and rotary-wing aircraft operating as air tour aircraft will be development and validated. 
The main objectives are to provide the FAA and the Volpe Center with significant analyst manpower for the purpose of AEDT data analysis and AEDT and fuel consumption model development; and flexibly take on data analysis and model development assignments and provide a written report on the findings in a timely manner.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />The 59th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Nellis AFB Las Vegas, NV, 89191 requires the purchase of maintenance and support for specific laboratory instrument. The 99th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Entron Systems Company of 815 N. Downs Street Suite C, Ridgecrest, CA 93555. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@nellis.af.mil or fax 702-652-5405, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Friday,&nbsp;24 July 2009; 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time.<br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br />22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
<p>Entron Systems Company, of Ridgecrest, CA, is the only vendor with the ability to provide the required maintenance and support.. Entron is the the original manufacturer and contractor of the laboratory instruments. Entron's proprietary data, engineering schematics and innovations must be protected. To procure the maintenance and support from a company, other than Entron would result in another company having to design and manufacture a complete new product.. To replicate the engineering and manufacturing tasks similar to those of Entron, would cost the Government several hundred thousand dollars, far exceeding the current Goverment estimate. In summary, to procure the required maintenance and support from any company, other than Entron would result in substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.</p>

United States Department of the InteriorJustification of Other than Full and Open Competition Under $25,000
1) Briefly, a description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs and include the estimated value.Switched Voice T-1 (DSS) service for the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge
2)  Statutory Authority  permitting other than full and open competition.  Identify the statutory authority permitting with the FAR citation and FAR citation Title.  FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
3) WHY are the proposed contractor's unique qualifications for the nature of the acquisition requiring the use of the authority cited in item (2). Nushagak Telephone Cooperative is the Dillingham Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier.  It is the only business capable of offering local switched voice T-1 service in Dillingham, Alaska.
4) WHAT effort was made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practical.  FWS contacted GCI, AT&T, and ACS via telephone to query if recent business activity had changed in Dillingham, Alaska. These companies do not offer local switched voice service in Dillingham. FWS also contacted the RCA (Regulatory Commission of Alaska) and they confirmed no other phone company can provide the requested service in Dillingham. Nushagak is the only company because it has a rural exemption, which limits the number of services it is required to sell to other companies.
5) A Description of the Market survey conducted and the results. GCI, AT&T, and ACS are long distance providers only and do not offer local switched voice service. All steps to remove or overcome barriers to competition have been taken.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Naval Air Systems Command; Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) (AIR 2.5.1.3), Patuxent River, MD  20670-1127 intends to obtain, on a sole source basis with Wyle Laboratories, 7800 Highway 20 West, Huntsville, AL 35806, six (6) months of extended effort under existing contract N00421-04-C-0121 which provides specialized technical support to the AIR 4.3 Structures Division.  This requirement does not increase the ceiling value of the existing contract.   The continuation of services fulfills an existing need until efforts currently on-going under the instant contract are completed.  This action is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10, U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and is in accordance with the terms of clauses FAR 52.217-8 and FAR 52.217-9.  While this notice of intent is for information purposes only, and not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability, respond to this requirement, and submit information, which shall be considered by the NAWCAD.  The Government retains the right not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice. Capabilities information may be faxed to Miriam Bonk, AIR-2.5.1.3.1.5 at (301) 757-8959.

<SUBJECT>C--Notice of Intent to Modify Contract N62742-08-D-0009, Program Support Contract for Various Projects Covered by the DPRI, to a Fixed Price/Cost Reimbursement Contract
<SOLNBR>N6274208D0009
<ARCHDATE>08142009
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific (NAVFAC Pacific) intends to modify IDIQ contract N62742-08-D-0009 from a Fixed Price (FP) contract to a combination FP/cost reimbursement contract capable of issuing both Cost-Plus Award Fee (CPAF) and FP task orders.  Contract N62742-08-D-0009 is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity A-E contract awarded to Pacific Program-Design Management Services JV with a one-year base period of September 30, 2008 through September 29, 2009 and four (4) one-year option periods.  The contract provides for program management, design management, and other support services for various projects covered by the Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) and other projects under the cognizance of NAVFAC Pacific.  Pursuant to FAR 16.103(c), changing circumstances may make a different contract type appropriate in later periods than used at the outset.  Due to the program's uncertainties and fluctuating priorities, the Government now requires a greater amount of flexibility to respond to programmatic areas to successfully and effectively meet mission requirements.  The Government intends to obtain program management services via CPAF task orders while design management services will continue to be obtained via FP task orders.  However, if future conditions support the use of CPAF on design management or other support services, the Government reserves the right to consider CPAF for those requirements.  There will be no change in the contract's total not-to-exceed amount of $100,000,000 over the entire contract term.  
This notice is not a request for proposals.  Written inquiries concerning this notice shall be directed in writing to Mr. Melvin Yoshimura at melvin.yoshimura@navy.mil within 10 days from the publication date of this notice.  The determination to proceed with the proposed modification is solely at the discretion of the Government.

The U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Coastal Hydraulics Laboratory Field Data Collection and Analysis Branch conducts riverine and offshore hydrographic surveys and assessments using various oceanographic sensors using branch owned hydrographic vessels for long periods of time and under continuous low rpm operations. Due to the conditions the surveys are conducted in, the vessels require 2 highly reliable outboard engines with sufficient power to quickly maneuver around obstructions. Additionally, the FDCA Branch currently maintains a large stockpile of replacement/repairable parts for these engines and the technicians are specifically trained and certified with Mercury Marine to maintain and repair Optimax outboards at minimal cost to the Federal Government.<BR><BR>The following are essential characteristics of the Mercury Optimax Outboard Engines:<BR><BR>Two (2) Mercury 150 horsepower Optimax outboard motors with associated gages and wiring harnesses to make them work on a vessel. The gages should include the tachometer, speed sensor, water pressure, tilt and water temperature. The cables should include all control and electrical cables to facilitate motor operation. These motors will work in unison on the same vessel so the port motor must be counter rotating so as to give maximum control of the vessel. <BR><BR>The following motors and accessories are to be procured:<BR><BR>1. Two Mercury Optimax outboard engines, p/n: 1150D83HY- ME150XL OPT and 1150D84HY  ME  150CXL OPT.<BR><BR>2. One Switch/Lanyard Kit, p/n: 814324A2<BR><BR>3.

<a href="mailto:paula.poppy@va.gov">CONTRACTING sPECIALIST</a>
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENTThe 	VA Medical Center, Engineering, Boston Healthcare System, MA. Intends to 	Sole Source a procurement for the following service: Installation of new PIV card access readers and transitional software for PIV conversion to interface with existing security software, security alarm systems, original security equipment and previously installed security card reader equipment (installed by this vendor) for the medical security alarm systems located at three (3) VA Boston Medical facilities. FAR 6.302-1, USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source, will meet the agencies requirement and time constraint. This vendor previously installed part of the equipment and will warrantee the equipment, software and maintenance for up to one year from installation. 		 The entire Medical Center Complex (all three divisions/facilites) is on a Hirsch Electronics card access system. The system provides security to the complex and is connected directly to monitors in the Police headquarters at all three divisions. The nodes of the system are in controlled spaces throughout the facility. Access to the spaces is strictly controlled to assure the security of this system and the other critical Information Systems in these spaces.The system as a whole, has over $3,750,000 of installed equipment, it is an essential part of assuring Safety and Security of patients and staff at three Medical Centers. Accordingly, as we look toward adding PIV card access readers to the security system it is essential that we safeguard our investment and the systems overall integrity. The system as installed is a Hirsh Electronics system. The Vendor is a local authorized dealer of Hirsch Electronics who is covered under GSA contract GS-07F-7733C.  Hirsch Electronics is the sole manufacture of the large complex system that we presently have installed for our card access security system. Several components of this request are not Hirsch Electronics, but at the same time they have to interface with our existing Hirsch Electronics system.  The recommended source has demonstrated both the ability to install the system properly and to troubleshoot problems when we have them. The workmen have shown that they are reliable and can be trusted which is also essential because of the secured spaces they will be working in.The contractor is familiar with what is already in place as far as the existing security alarm systems and what has newly been installed in all three facilities within the past year, therefore the contractor is able to assess the situation, configure the VA facility security needs in a manner that is in the best interest for the VA Boston Healthcare System, taking into consideration the time constraint which needs to coincide with the issuance of the new access cards to staff members, scheduled for July 27nd, 2009, cost effectiveness and of most importance value to the Government. No other contractor has knowledge of all three facilities as far as the layout of previously installed equipment, the interaction with various supporting software and security equipment and past performance experience regarding installation, and maintenance. The VA does not have an adequate inventory and description layout of all the previously installed equipment or the newly installed equipment immediately available in order to allow other vendors to provide an adequate proposal that will meet the needs of the three VA facilities in a timely, cost efficient and in the best interest of the Government. Moreover, if some other contractor worked on the system and the VA had problems after the fact, with the system, we could easily end up in a dispute between contractors that we could not be easily resolve as each vendor could blame the other for the problems with the system and the VA, even with the devotion of a lot of time, it would be hard pressed to determine who was at fault. This could be a costly and time consuming venture to the Government, not to mention possible break in the continuity of security/alarm system services that could possibly shut down three VA facilities security systems, causing loss of security control for VA patients, lack of facility access for veterans, employees and customers and compromise heavily secured areas of the VA medical Healthcare System, i.e. medications/drugs, psychiatric departments. VA Engineering Service believes that a critical system like this one needs to be taken care of and modified by a single company so when there are problems a single source can be contacted for immediate correction. The contractor has agreed to cover the service, software and equipment maintenance for one full year from time of installation not from equipment purchase, at no additional cost to the Government, to include 24/7 on call emergency maintenance service.The contractor has warranted certain aspects of the system presently installed at the Jamaica Plain campus, this installation and two other facilities will be interfacing with.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENTThe 	VA Medical Center, Engineering, Boston Healthcare System, MA. Intends to 	Sole Source a procurement for the following service: Installation of new PIV card access readers and transitional software for PIV conversion to interface with existing security software, security alarm systems, original security equipment and previously installed security card reader equipment (installed by this vendor) for the medical security alarm systems located at three (3) VA Boston Medical facilities. FAR 6.302-1, USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source, will meet the agencies requirement and time constraint. This vendor previously installed part of the equipment and will warrantee the equipment, software and maintenance for up to one year from installation. 		 The entire Medical Center Complex (all three divisions/facilites) is on a Hirsch Electronics card access system. The system provides security to the complex and is connected directly to monitors in the Police headquarters at all three divisions. The nodes of the system are in controlled spaces throughout the facility. Access to the spaces is strictly controlled to assure the security of this system and the other critical Information Systems in these spaces.The system as a whole, has over $3,750,000 of installed equipment, it is an essential part of assuring Safety and Security of patients and staff at three Medical Centers. Accordingly, as we look toward adding PIV card access readers to the security system it is essential that we safeguard our investment and the systems overall integrity. The system as installed is a Hirsh Electronics system. The Vendor is a local authorized dealer of Hirsch Electronics who is covered under GSA contract GS-07F-7733C.  Hirsch Electronics is the sole manufacture of the large complex system that we presently have installed for our card access security system. Several components of this request are not Hirsch Electronics, but at the same time they have to interface with our existing Hirsch Electronics system.  The recommended source has demonstrated both the ability to install the system properly and to troubleshoot problems when we have them. The workmen have shown that they are reliable and can be trusted which is also essential because of the secured spaces they will be working in.The contractor is familiar with what is already in place as far as the existing security alarm systems and what has newly been installed in all three facilities within the past year, therefore the contractor is able to assess the situation, configure the VA facility security needs in a manner that is in the best interest for the VA Boston Healthcare System, taking into consideration the time constraint which needs to coincide with the issuance of the new access cards to staff members, scheduled for July 27nd, 2009, cost effectiveness and of most importance value to the Government. No other contractor has knowledge of all three facilities as far as the layout of previously installed equipment, the interaction with various supporting software and security equipment and past performance experience regarding installation, and maintenance. The VA does not have an adequate inventory and description layout of all the previously installed equipment or the newly installed equipment immediately available in order to allow other vendors to provide an adequate proposal that will meet the needs of the three VA facilities in a timely, cost efficient and in the best interest of the Government. Moreover, if some other contractor worked on the system and the VA had problems after the fact, with the system, we could easily end up in a dispute between contractors that we could not be easily resolve as each vendor could blame the other for the problems with the system and the VA, even with the devotion of a lot of time, it would be hard pressed to determine who was at fault. This could be a costly and time consuming venture to the Government, not to mention possible break in the continuity of security/alarm system services that could possibly shut down three VA facilities security systems, causing loss of security control for VA patients, lack of facility access for veterans, employees and customers and compromise heavily secured areas of the VA medical Healthcare System, i.e. medications/drugs, psychiatric departments. VA Engineering Service believes that a critical system like this one needs to be taken care of and modified by a single company so when there are problems a single source can be contacted for immediate correction. The contractor has agreed to cover the service, software and equipment maintenance for one full year from time of installation not from equipment purchase, at no additional cost to the Government, to include 24/7 on call emergency maintenance service.The contractor has warranted certain aspects of the system presently installed at the Jamaica Plain campus, this installation and two other facilities will be interfacing with. This will allow the whole system located at three facilities throughout Boston, to be maintained by one source, the contractor that installed all aspects of the entire security system. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>VAMC Coatesville is soliciting for the awarding of this contract to provide boiler inspections/evaluations on our boilers currently in use.VA medical centers provide critical health care which requires reliable steam supply for sterilization, domestic hot water, kitchens, and building heating/air conditioning. Boilers serving VA medical centers must be reliable, safe and efficient.  The age of boilers is often a major indicator of reliability. The VHA Directive 2003-050, BOILER PLANT OPERATIONS, assigns useful life expectancy, in years, to the boiler plant equipment.  The Directive requires that retention of equipment beyond the useful life expectancy must be based on an engineering evaluation of the reliability, efficiency and cost effectiveness of continued operation.Following are boilers to be included in evaluation#1 - D-type E. Keeler Company mfg. 1968, 20,000#/hr, serial # 14579-1  	#2 - D-type E. Keeler Company mfg. 1968, 20,000#/hr, serial # 14579-2  	#3 - D-type E. Keeler Company mfg. 1968, 40,000#/hr, serial # 14580-2  #4 - D-type E. Keeler Company mfg. 1968, 20,000#/hr, serial # 14580-1  The station has 4 boilers, of which 2 must be always be available for service. 1 of the boilers is currently out of service on a long term basis. The most practical phasing possible would be an inspection of the out of service boiler with 1 of the remaining, then 2 subsequent return visits to inspect the remaining boilers. The boiler staff will require 2 days between inspections to drain, cool and rinse the boiler to be inspected.   It is anticipated that 2 days will be needed for each inspection.

Participating measurement systems are required to provide facility-specific and comparison group performance data to Joint Commission for use in their accreditation process, and to provide feedback reports to its clients in the form of comparison graphs and control charts. On July 21, 1997, the Office of Quality and Performance was notified that VHA's performance measurement system had been accepted for inclusion on Joint Commission's list of acceptable systems, and its official title is Veterans Performance Measurement System (VPMS). In January 1998, VHA's National Leadership Board agreed that all VHA facilities would utilize the VPMS as their identified ORYX measurement system. The VPMS meets all ORYX requirements for acute care (hospital), behavioral health care and home care, and is committed to meeting all future Joint Commission criteria for these programs. The intent of VHA submitting its own measurement system for consideration was to promote the concept of one performance measurement system; to ensure the ORYX requirements were transparent, to the extent possible, to VHA's own performance measures; and to avoid duplicate systems and data collection requirements. Joint Commission implemented hospital core measures on July 1, 2002 with the introduction of four initial core measure sets. Currently, VPMS is collecting and transmitting hospital data on Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Heart Failure (HF), and Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). However, some hospitals use a combination of both core and non-core hospital measures. In 2004, the VPMS will embed the most recent core measure set for Surgical Infection Prevention, but currently has no plans to collect or transmit data to Joint Commission. At the present time, there are no ORYX requirements for ambulatory care-accredited facilities. Joint Commission depicts an accredited hospital's core measure performance as compared to other Joint Commission-accredited hospitals, both nationally and by state, in its new Quality Report. Joint Commission posted the first Quality Reports in July of 2004 which included 2003 core measure results. As quarterly ORYX core measure data are submitted and analyzed, Joint Commission "refreshes" ORYX core measure information for all accredited hospital Quality Reports (as applicable). In addition, the Office of Quality and Performance provides an analysis of VAMC results, as well as a national and VISN summary. Also included is a public relations package to assist facilities in responding to any questions or inquiries from the public. This information is updated quarterly to coincide with the Joint Commission's Quality Report update. At the present time, there are no ORYX requirements for ambulatory care-accredited facilities. For long-term care ORYX requirements, VHA has a waiver to use RAI-MDS data internally until Joint Commission develops and implements core measures for long-term care.1.

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions.

All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

C)  Seller is providing these products via IBM authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full IBM warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>The Department of State, Bureau of Public Affairs (PA) proposes to acquire Hewlett Packard equipment.   This equipment will augment the Bureaus existing technical platform. 
Rationale for HP brand name: In a large computer network, diversity of brands and models severely drives up total cost of ownership (TCO)	Staff must be trained on procedures specific to each brand of workstations	Operating system images must be created, tested, and updated for each brand of PC on the network because images contain the hardware drivers required for the operating system to function with that particular brand of PC. Maintaining multiple brand images duplicates administrators workload, driving up TCO.	When manufacturer support is required to repair any hardware, all support calls go to the same place for any system. 	All equipment comes with a 3 year warranty, preventing technical obsolescence and keeping support costs down by always having equipment covered by manufacturers warranty.	Using non HP products could potentially void the warranty.
PA has a significant prior investment in HP servers. The goal of PA/EX/IT is to consolidate the network servers, desktops, laptops etc. to a cohesive configuration, making administration and support more efficient and thorough. This will result in less user downtime and the best possible contribution to the Departments mission and goals.<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 for full and open competition.  

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for, brand-name or equal for the following laboratory equipment: 

Two requirements for Systems 1 & 2:
CLIN0001	IBIS T6000 Biosensor system, which consists of integrated robotics for sample cleanup, sample introduction fluidics, a mass spectrometer for measurement of the DNA Amplicons, and a computer system to control the T6000 and handle the database for identification of the  bacteria.  System comes with a one-year manufacturers warranty known here as base year. Quantity 2 each.

CLIN009	Thermo Fisher, King Fisher Flex System with 96 deep-well head with accessories, Tip comb KF96 F/DW Magnet CS100 (#97002534), Plaste PP 96 Deep V-BTM 2 ML CS50 (95040450) and Plates 96 well KF 200UL PK48 (97002540), quantity 1 each.

CLIN010	Installation and training 
CLIN011	Option year 1, service and maintenance agreement for all three (3) systems.


Requirements and specifications that shall be met by the purchase:  

A.  General Requirements:  The systems that FDA requires shall use an integrated sample preparation and measurement approach.  It shall use robotics to extract and isolate DNA from samples, followed by transfer to a PCR thermal cycler to amplify the DNA after introduction of particular, and specifically chosen, primers.  Once the amplification has been completed, the sample will be robotically handled and cleaned up, followed by analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry.  A mass spectrometry measurement of the PCR amplicons gives a detailed organism fingerprint, which provides much more information than a simple yes/no answer provided by probes in real-time PCR; detection is not limited to previously known organisms.  The approach can rapidly identify organisms in a mixture without additional sample preparation steps.  By adjusting the primer selection, the method can be made general or specific and can rapidly identify mutations (within the amplified region). The approach can handle many different types of samples including: air, soil, water, mucosal swabs and washes, sterile fluids (blood, CSF, urine), hair, teeth, and bone, making it very amenable to food matrices.  The approach is also high throughput, allowing for the analysis of 600-1200 samples per 24 hour period.

Specific Requirements:  

1. Robotic system for handling liquid extracts from KingFisher plates and transferring them to IBIS kits for PCR amplification (Based on Tecan EVO75system).

d.  Rotor: holds 2 microplates
e.  Acceleration time to max. speed: <25 s
f.  Braking time from max. speed: <25 s
4. Biosensor requirements
a.  PCR-based amplification of DNA from samples to produce amplicons of 100-120 base pair length, using carefully selected primers that can classify organisms generally or specifically.
i.   PCR Assay and clean-up kit:  This kit contains ten 96-well plates with pre-selected PCR primers that amplify carefully selected regions of DNA to produce products in the size range compatible with the mass range and resolving power of the mass spectrometer.  These PCR primers are selected based on the target study and can provide general or specific information about the nature of the organisms in question.   The primers are specifically designed by IBIS.  Internal standards are also included in the kits.
b.  Robotic cleanup of PCR amplicons.
i.   Automated desalting and cleanup module:  This component consists of a robotic heat sealer which seals the 96-well plates so that they cannot be contaminated, followed by robotic desalting and clean-up of the PCR amplicons.  Desalting is done on magnetic beads.  This system is designed to minimize the possibility of sample contamination.
ii.   Robotics handles up to 15 plates at one time, and contains reagents to handle all 15 plates
iii.   Processing rate:  30 seconds per well 
c.  Sample injection fluidics module:  A custom fluidics module is designed to sample each purified mixture with minimal cross contamination and introduce it into a liquid stream at a carefully controlled flow rate for subsequent ESI-MS analysis.  The system alternates between high flow rates (for cleaning between samples) and lower flow rates (200 microliters per minute) for the analytical steps.  The module precisely controls injection volumes as well.  The injection system controls the voltages on the electrospray source so that the system is not electrospraying while higher cleaning flow rates are being used between samples.
d.  Electrospray TOF-MS analysis of amplicons at high mass accuracy (<20 ppm).
i.   Mass spectrometer system for DNA detection:  This component consists of an electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF) for analysis of PCR products introduced by the sample injection fluidics module.  This instrument consists of an orthogonal injection time-of-flight mass spectrometer with an off-axis sprayer.  The orthogonal injection source allows for ion accumulation prior to MS analysis to improve sensitivity.  The TOF contains a reflectron to insure high mass resolution.  The mass spectrometer is controlled software that is integrated into IBIS Control software.  The instrument has the following specifications:
1. Standard mass range 500  2,000 m/z
2. Mass resolution 10,000 FWHM or greater in standard configuration at m/z 1034
3. Mass accuracy of 3 ppm (RMS) error with internal calibration in negative polarity
4. Mass accuracy of 20 ppm or less (RMS) error with external calibration
5. ESI orthogonal electrospray source (1l 1 ml/min)
6. Instrument control software
e.  High throughput analysis capability of over 1500 PCR products per day.
f.  Control and Analysis Software
1. Robotics Software:  controls and coordinates the sample handling and sample injection processes by controlling the robotic components of the system.  This includes the cleanup and injection portion of the analysis.
2. Control software:  This component manages the liquid flow system and the mass spectrometer (by interfacing with the mass spectrometer software), as well as integrates the total operation of the system
3. Sample tracking software
4. Relational database:  Curated database of genomics information that contains base counts (composition) for primer pairs for microorganisms.  This database contains sequences generated by known primers for a large number of microorganisms.  The information is maintained for primers that are designed to differentiate at the family level (e.g. enterobacter) and at the species and strain level.  This database is a unique and indispensable part of the system, since base compositions stored in this database will be compared with those generated experimentally.  This component is critical for rapid detection and proper identification of bacteria.  
5. Analysis of the masses of complementary DNA strands to identify unique composition (based on DNA strand complements) of bases in strand.
6. Comparison of base composition to library of known base compositions (for given primers) for known organisms
7. Data Processor:  Analyzes mass spectrometry data from both forward and reverse strands of amplified DNA to generate the unique base composition for the sequence in question.  It function is to then compare the generated base composition to a database of known base compositions that would be generated from sequences produced for a given set of primers.

<DESC><p>STATEMENT OF WORK <br />Load Balancer Hardware and Support
<p>1.1 Background Information<br />This acquisition is for the direct support of the Biomedical Translational Research Information System. This new system is housed within the NIH Clinical Center data center but is an enterprise system that supports the entire NIH intramural research community.</p>
<p>1.2 BTRIS Overview<br />The Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS) is an NIH enterprise clinical research data repository. The BTRIS is designed to assist researchers with many aspects of managing information through the research cycle. At present, no one system allows clinical researchers to combine data gathered for patient care with data generated through specific research activities. No current system allows for a researcher to access data from across one protocol, multiple protocols or by disease state. No current system allows researchers broad access to de-identified data for hypothesis generation or for patient recruitment. BTRIS will be comprised of data, text and images from the NIH Clinical Center systems but will also include data from institute research systems and from individual institute researchers. Human subjects' research policies will guide access to data for active protocols as well as to the wealth of data from terminated protocols.</p>
<p>The BTRIS application will be accessed through the web and to accomplish this we have four dedicated IIS web servers split evenly between our Production and Test environments. A load balancer is needed to ensure that the web servers get an even amount of traffic for peak performance.</p>
<p>1.3 Project Scope<br />&bull; The Government seeks to purchase load balancer hardware with maintenance and support to extend for three years. This hardware shall be used to balance web traffic to the BTRIS Production and Test web servers<br />&bull; Project Contract Type<br />The National Institutes of Health anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract through NITAAC.<br />1.3.1 Technical Implementation Team<br />This hardware will be installed and supported by BTRIS technical staff.<br />2 General Requirements<br />The offeror will provide 1 Load Balancer and support for 3 years from date of purchase. <br />3 Specific Features and Functions of Hardware<br />BTRIS needs hardware with basic and cost-effective L4 load balancing capabilities to deliver dramatically improved application scalability, high availability and performance across multiple servers, firewalls and many other devices. This will ensure that users are sent to applications that are running properly regardless of expected or unexpected outages at the network, server, or application level; ensuring high availability and eliminating downtime.</p>
<p>4 Requirements</p>
<p>&bull; The load balancer hardware must be capable of handling gigabit IP traffic and of utilizing IVP6. <br />&bull; Using a unique "predictive" algorithm, traffic will be routed to the most efficient and available server.<br />&bull; The load balancing solution will balance TCP requests between two or more servers in order to insure system uptime in the event of a hardware or system failure.<br />&bull; Load balancer shall provide load mitigation for increased system performance, with the ability to provide redundancy in the event of system failure. <br />&bull; Using icmp and tcp keepalives, all servers in the cluster can be monitored such that in the event a server goes down, requests are automatically and seamlessly rerouted to other servers.<br />&bull; Load balancing methods must include the following:</p>
<p>o Fastest: Passes user connection to available server that responds the fastest<br />o Round Robin: Sends traffic to the next available server in a predetermined sequence <br />o Least Connections: Connects the user to the server with the least number of current connections <br />o Ratio: Performs 'ratios' on the server that best fits the request, according to a system that assigns weights for various factors, such as server capacity.</p>
<p>&bull; Load balancer must be able to heighten network security while providing added protection to servers and devices against cyber attacks through Default Deny, IP Address checking and port mapping, NAT, SNAT (Secure Network Address Translation) and complete SSL/SSH management. <br />&bull; Load balancer must protect against SYN flood attacks by filtering out the heaviest attacks while delivering uninterrupted service for legitimate connections.<br />&bull; For ease of implementation and simplified management, a GUI interface is preferred.<br />5 Maintenance/Support <br />6 Include user support via phone or e-mail<br />&bull; Provision of all software upgrades, patches and hotfixes (Provision of documentation for all software upgrades, patches and hotfixes.<br />&bull; Repair or replacement as needed of defective equipmentEvaluation Criteria (based on 100 pts)<br />Based on four criteria:</p>
<p>1. Meets technical specification requirements - 40 points<br />2. Meets security specification requirements - 20 points<br />3. Meets maintenance/support requirements - 20 points<br />Meets best value requirements - 20 point</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service prepared and processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This is a Solicitation for the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Habitat Conservation, located in Silver Spring, MD is seeking services for Caribbean coral restoration support contract for vessel and dive support in the area of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Government intends to issue a Time and Materials contract with a Not To Exceed capacity of $400,000.00 and a period of performance of three (3) years from date of award.
<p>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Habitat Conservation (OHC) interacts with NOAA/NMFS regional offices to manage, conserve and enhance habitats for fishery resources, protected species and other living marine resources, and is the focal point for marine and estuarine habitat restoration within NOAA. The Restoration Center (RC), a division of OHC, performs coastal habitat restoration pursuant to federal legislation and improves the state of restoration ecology and habitat management, and is responsible for restoring degraded habitats, advancing the science of coastal habitat restoration, transferring restoration technologies to other agencies and practitioners, and fostering habitat stewardship and a conservation ethic. In support of these responsibilities, OHC ensures that NOAA's resources are protected and restored in accordance with appropriate Acts and mandates. <br /><br />Coral Reefs in the U.S. Caribbean (USVI and PR) reefs are annually impacted by 1-2 hurricanes, 2-3 large ship groundings, nearly 100 of small boat groundings, and tons of marine debris and derelict fishing. These physical impacts from hurricanes, vessel groundings, anchors, and marine debris are major threats to coral reef health and integrity and present a direct disturbance to the coral environment that can completely alter a reefs structure and function. After these acute disturbances, fragments are subject to abrasion, scour, and sedimentation, which can ultimately result in death. Unchecked, these damages can result in reef loss and instability, reducing coastal protection, causing economic impact to local fisheries, and eliminating key tourist attractions on which many coastal economies depend. However, if dislodged fragments can be collected and stabilized shortly after physical impact then, the probability of survival increases substantially.</p>
<p>While NOAA and local jurisdictions have some limited personnel and desire to respond to these impact events, we often have difficulties securing the necessary logistical support (vessel and dive support) to respond to these events in a timely manner.</p>
<p>In addition to these direct physical impacts NOAA is also often faced with logistical limitations when responding to other hazard events and/or when conducting general coral reef management and research activities.<br />In an effort to address the limited logistical support discussed above NOAA seeks support from a firm that can provide logistical support to the local partners and NOAA staff conducting activities in the region. See Scope of Services in attached solicitation.</p>
<p>SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: See attached solicitation and attachment for submittal requirements. To be considered, interested firms must submit the following no later than 2:00 p.m. CDT on August 6, 2009 to the following: One (1) electronic submittal package to email address pamela.l.stichweh@noaa.gov; Submissions may be faxed if email submission is not feasible. Fax to: 816-274-6967 Proposing firms are responsible for supplying information concerning each evaluation factor, including copies of any professional certifications or licenses. See Section D of the attached request for proposal for specific submission requirements.</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) database. Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting CCR at: Federal Service Desk (8am - 8pm Eastern Time) at 866-606-8220 or 334-206-7828.

ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and previously found in solicitations. According to the language in FAR case 2002-024, vendors are required to use ORCA beginning 01 January 2005. Detailed information can be found by visiting the Help section of the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>VETS-100 Requirement:<br />Per Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) part 22.1303 all firms must complete their VETS-100 report via the Department of Labor website at https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/ to be eligible for award.</p>

<DESC><p>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />FSM-45PM Polarization Maintaining Fiber Splicer Kit
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NB815030-9-16218SRG.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-35.</p>
<p>(IV) The procurement is unrestricted and open to all sources. The associated NAICS code is 334515. The small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item:<br />CLIN 0001 - Brand Name or Equal to FSM-45PM Polarization Maintaining Fiber Splicer Kit Model #S014339</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows: <br />CLIN 0001 - Brand Name or Equal to FSM-45PM Polarization Maintaining Fiber Splicer Kit Model #S014339 (includes Splicer V-Groove Cleaning Kit and SpliceLab Research and Development Software)</p>
<p>The following are specifications:<br />1. A requirement for this purchase is a Fiber fusion splicer using active core alignment and capable of splicing polarization maintaining (PM) fiber as well as different types of doped and specialty fibers. This fiber splicer will allow for development of a number of different fiber-based cw lasers, pulsed lasers, frequency combs and fiber systems which will be used as part of our effort to develop high repetition rate, low phase noise fiber-based systems to support the NIST IMS on precision timing and low phase noise microwave sources.<br />2. Fiber splicers are often temperamental. For proper and continued operation they require flexibility in their programming, care and cleaning by the user, and support from the manufacturer both in terms of software, upkeep, and new parts. Therefore, a significant factor in choosing our splicer is that we purchase it from an established splicer manufacturer with a solid history of developing splicers and with the expectation of continued support after the purchase of the splicer. <br />3. In order to develop high repetition rate lasers, NIST will need to make short cavities. The splice length is therefore often a limiting factor. A non-PM splicer can provide ~ 3 cm long splices. A PM splicer will have longer splices, but we need to keep this length to a minimum.<br />4. Reliable, high-quality splicing<br />5. Ability to make short splices</p>

1.0 SCOPE:  This Performance Work Statement (PWS) describes requirements for verbatim transcripts from television and radio news coverage of defense-related segments and interviews with Department of Defense (DoD) and national security officials.  There are three types of transcripts required and each has its individual format, time requirements, and delivery methods.  The contractor shall provide delivery of all verbatim transcripts in Microsoft Word format via e-mail to the Current News Service.

2.0 Background and Mission:  The Current News Service is charged with providing the Secretary and Department of Defense with a daily morning compilation of news and commentary.  The primary means for doing so is the Early Bird, completed and online by 0530 on weekdays and 0600 on weekends (and holidays, as required).  It is in the Early Bird that most of the transcripts covered by this contract will appear, with staff members making the selection decisions on what to, and not to, include, each night.  The Current News Service will be part of the Defense Media Activity until the end of Fiscal Year 2009 (September 30, 2009), at which time it will become officially part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs).  The transfer does not affect the requirements.  

3.0 Requirement:

Therefore, the total annual requirement is for 355 newsletters (356 in leap years).

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The Uniformed
Services University
of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda,
 Maryland, intends to negotiate an
option year contract with three option years, on a sole source basis, under the
authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 (b), with Fibergate, Inc. to supply a leasing
and maintenance agreement of dark fiber cables connecting two nearby locations.
The leasing and maintenance is being procured as a commercial item in
accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items)
and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures). The sole source
determination is based on Fibergate being the original installers of the
existing fiber cables. In addition to installing the fiber cables, Fibergate
owns the existing fiber cables connecting USUHS to its other remote sites.
Furthermore, award to another source will result in substantial duplication of
cost to the Government. The period of performance for the required agreement
commences on August 1, 2009 and ends July 31, 2010.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">This is not a request for quote.
However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed
below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to
provide compelling evidence that they can provide the aforementioned leasing
and maintenance agreement as specified. Additionally, a determination by the
government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses
received is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses must be
submitted electronically, via email, to <a href="mailto:tosin.abari@usuhs.mil">tosin.abari@usuhs.mil</a>.
The deadline for the submittal of responses is July 21, 2009, 1:00 pm Eastern

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation 2009-N-11489 is attached.

The associated NAICS code is 519130 and the small business size standard in number of employees is 500.

<p>Title of Project: Digital Social Media Marketing Campaign in support of the 2009 Surgeon General's Report (SGR) on Tobacco for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health (NCCDPHP/OSH)</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to deploy the services of a Digital Marketing company with experience developing multi-level digital campaigns that apply social media elements to reach our intended audiences: physicians (specifically cardiologists), policy makers, and the general public. This company should have experience in healthcare and consumer social media marketing to accelerate and broaden information distribution.</p>
<p>1. Background and Need -</p>
<p>The CDC, Office on Smoking and Health, is preparing for the release of the 2009 Surgeon General's Report (SGR) on tobacco. In support of this release, our office has a need to engage the services of a digital marketing company with experience in healthcare and consumer digital social media marketing. This proposed acquisition is being pursued in order to reach modern audiences that prefer to receive news, health and other information through internet sites such as Face Book, Twitter, and MySpace through multiple devices including mobile phones. Tailoring messages for these internet and mobile sites requires specialized knowledge of the audiences which frequent them. As fewer and fewer people access newspapers, network television and traditional internet sites for information, employing a digital multi-site approach increases the reach of communications efforts.</p>
<p>2. Project Objective -</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to deploy the services of a Digital Marketing company with experience developing multi-level digital campaigns that apply social media elements to reach our intended audiences: physicians (specifically cardiologists), policy makers, and the general public.

<p><em><strong>Questions and answers</strong></em></p>
<p>Q. 1) The configuration specifies (Quantity 3) of "HP StorageWorks 60 Modular Smart Array". I believe this should be two. Each one of these Smart Arrays houses 12 drives each. We have two sets of 12 drives each. The answer for question number one is three "HP StorageWorks 60Modular Smart Array". The third array will be populated by hard drives already purchased.</p>
<p>Not sure why there is 3. So, my question is should this be "Quantity 2" for "HP StorageWorks 60 Modular Smart Array"?</p>
<p><em>A. Three arrays are needed due the current hard drives here on site.</em></p>
<p>Q. 2) Similar to question above, there are typically one P800 to manage each set of 12 drives and Smart Array Module. There are typically one P800 for each HP StorageWorks 60. So, my question again is should there be (Quantity of P800 and (Quantity 2) of "HP StorageWorks 60"? The answer to question number two is two since we need redundancy if a controller fails.</p>
<p><em>A. Two P800 are needed for redundancy since we will not be able obtain another one quickly if a controller goes down.</em></p>
<p>Q. 3) Warranty of 24x7 is specified but, it does not specify the term. <br />Should it be 1 year? Or, should it be 3 years?</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the following information from this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation:

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Julabo LH-41 Temperature Bath.***

Background: The NIST Center for Neutron Research does basic materials research that is useful for many basic and applied science disciplines including biology, chemistry, condensed matter physics, polymer research, etc. The purpose of this procurement is to increase the number of temperature baths used for sample temperature control on multiple neutron scattering instruments. These temperature baths are all the same so that they may be interchanged as necessary and so that their controls are familiar for the group of scientists employing them. The objective of this procurement is to purchase a Julabo LH-41 temperature control bath, along with providing options for the future purchase of this same item.
Brand Name Only Justification: The Julabo model LH-45 is discontinued and model LH-41 takes its place with the same specifications as a drop-in replacement, including the software control. Julabo LH-41 Temperature Bath has proven to be very reliable, capable, and fast. The reasons that we wish to purchase this Brand Name Only item are: 1) to maintain a consistent equipment interface for local and guest researchers; 2) to serve as a drop-in replacement spare; and 3) to prevent duplication of effort that would be required to integrate a new system.

The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) presently has three Julabo LH45 ultra-low refrigerated circulators that have a working temperature range from -40 to 250 C. These are all used on neutron scattering instruments for control of the sample environment. The NCNR is a user facility serving approximately 1000 unique guest researchers per year, putting a great emphasis on the reliability, uptime and standardization of our equipment. 


***Line item 0001 is BRAND NAME ONLY requirements. 

***All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: 1 (one) Julabo LH-41 Temperature Bath.
Line Item 0002: 2 (two) Triple insulated (-350 C), 1.5 meter Metal tubing, M16 x 1.
Line Item 0003: 1 (one) Thermal P60 bath fluid, 10 liters.
Line Item 0004: 1 (one) Thermal P60 bath fluid, 5 liters.

And add the following information to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation:
*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Julabo Presto Plus LH-40 Air Cooled Temperature Bath. ***

Background:  The NIST Center for Neutron Research does basic materials research that is useful for many basic and applied science disciplines including biology, chemistry, condensed matter physics, polymer research, etc. The purpose of this procurement is to increase the number of temperature baths used for sample temperature control on multiple neutron scattering instruments. These temperature baths are all the same so that they may be interchanged as necessary and so that their controls are familiar for the group of scientists employing them. The objective of this procurement is to purchase a Julabo Presto Plus LH-40 Air Cooled temperature control bath, along with providing options for the future purchase of this same item.
Brand Name Only Justification: The Julabo model LH-45 is discontinued and model LH-41 takes its place with the same specifications as a drop-in replacement, including the software control.  Julabo Presto Plus LH-40 Air Cooled Temperature Bath has proven to be very reliable, capable, and fast. The reasons that we wish to purchase this Brand Name Only item are:  1) to maintain a consistent equipment interface for local and guest researchers; 2) to serve as a drop-in replacement spare; and 3) to prevent duplication of effort that would be required to integrate a new system.

The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) presently has three Julabo LH45 ultra-low refrigerated circulators that have a working temperature range from -40 to 250 C. These are all used on neutron scattering instruments for control of the sample environment. The NCNR is a user facility serving approximately 1000 unique guest researchers per year, putting a great emphasis on the reliability, uptime and standardization of our equipment. 


***Line item 0001 is BRAND NAME ONLY requirements.

<DESC>The above subject solicitation is hereby amended to address vendor questions and incorporate changes to the technical specifications

1.	Vendor Questions/Answers:

1.1 Question: Line Item 0001, specification #8 calls for the 3D scanners ability to scan a respirator mask .  Does the mask have metal in it?  Must the scanner be capable of scanning metal objects?

Answer: The mask contains little metal (typically just the screws), but it has a large glassy face shield. It will likely be necessary to coat the face shield with a paint or powder to be able to see it with a laser, prospective quoters may assume that all surfaces are opaque and non-glossy.  Should equipment be available that can actually see glass, the equipment would receive stronger consideration under technical capabilities. 


1.2 Question: Line Item 0001, specification #7 calls for a required resolution of 0.1 mm and the accuracy is noted as 0.05 mm (1/2 the resolution).  How can a 3D model be more accurate than the minimal level of image resolution it is capable of?  Is the requirement for accuracy as written (0.05 mm) valid?

Answer:  Resolution and accuracy are two different things.  Resolution is the minimum spacing between points in the direction perpendicular to the beam, and accuracy is the uncertainty in the direction parallel to the beam.  If the user is scanning a plane or smoothly curving surface, the accuracy is much more critical than the resolution, which simply makes sure that the surface is fully covered with points.  This is (pretty much) true for the head.  However, the mask does have a lot of crevices and sharp changes in direction.

2. Line item 0001 is hereby amended to incorporate changes to the technical specifications as follows:

2.1 Specification 7 is hereby amended to change the accuracy to equal or exceed 0.1mm and shall read as follows:

FROM:  Resolution to equal or exceed 0.1mm, accuracy to equal or exceed 0.05mm, depth-of-field to equal or exceed 10 cm. Finer resolution and accuracy are preferred. (Note: in this case exceed means smaller than).

TO: Resolution to equal or exceed 0.1mm, accuracy to equal or exceed 0.1mm, depth-of-field to equal or exceed 10 cm. Finer resolution and accuracy are preferred. (Note: in this case exceed means smaller than). Quoters are to describe the method for measuring accuracy.

The due date for quotes (July 28, 2009 @ 3pm EST) remains unchanged.

<DESC>Question that had been asked to NRCS in regards to the cost of title insurance, please see question asked and answer below:

QUESTION:  In Part I-The Schedule, Section B, USDA is asking my company to supply a Quote for Title Insurance Premium for $1000 Value.  What does this $1000 Value relate too?  Is this asking for $1000 per easement or some other figure such as the purchase price?  If it is another number, could you provide a range of purchase prices in the past?  

ANSWER:  The question is asking for a cost of title insurance per $1,000 value of the easement. 
Example: What is the cost of title insurance where the government has acquired an easement for $500,000? This needs to be expressed in cost/1000 dollars

 Section M-Evaluation Factors for Award changed from 100 total possible points to 80 points.

Delivery Date changed to July 22, 2009


Questions from Vendor with Answers from NRCS:

QUESTION: 1.  Is this contract seeking a Super Vendor which can handle title searches and closings in all 23 counties of Maryland? 

ANSWER: Yes, we are looking for a vendor that has the ability to handle title searches in all 23 counties
 
QUESTION:  2.  Are we in a stronger position if we submit bids for all 5 zones?
    
ANSWER: no

QUESTION:  3.  Does it weaken our chances to submit bids for only one or two zones?  In other words, if we are rated the best bid for the zones we bid for, will we be at a disadvantage if the second best bidder has submitted bids for all 5 zones? 
	
ANSWER: no
 
QUESTION:  4.If we will need to rely on subcontractors for title searches and closings in distant locations, do those subcontractors need to be disclosed in our bid?

ANSWER: No as long as the results meet the standards
 
QUESTION:  5. Will the buyer be preparing the Deeds, Covenants, Easement and other instruments to be recorded?  if so, this will lessen the cost of legal fees.  

ANSWER:  Yes NRCS prepares the deeds and everything associated with deeds including closing instructions, the closing agent will do the final title review then either NRCS completes the closing of the easement if necessary or else the closing agent will complete this step. 
We do not anticipate a change in the cost of the legal fees.

<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Contracting Officer, Email christopher.glista@darpa.mil
<DESC><p>The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting abstracts (white papers) and proposals for advanced research and development of Innovative Systems for Military Missions.  Innovative Systems are integrated systems or critical systems components, which often incorporate emerging advanced technologies, and which enable revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military. 
TTO seeks responses relating to five (5) Mission Thrust Areas (&ldquo;Mission Thrusts&rdquo;):
- Space Operations
- Land, Air, Sea and Space Platforms
- Unmanned Systems
- Directed Energy
- Precision Strike
Responses to the thrust areas may be submitted at any time during the open period of this solicitation. 
TTO's solicitation focuses on the high risk/high payoff development, integration, demonstration and evaluation of innovative systems or critical systems components enabled by, and incorporating, new or emerging technologies. Proposed efforts must also show significant promise to provide the U.S. military with revolutionary new mission capabilities, and/or enable significant increases in mission effectiveness.
Innovative system concepts of interest to TTO typically address emerging technical opportunities, advanced systems concepts, emergent threats, and/or new technology-enabled concepts of operation. TTO strongly encourages respondents to adopt a complete systems engineering approach to the problems.
This BAA solicits both abstracts (white papers) and proposals for proposed efforts. Offerors are strongly encouraged to initially submit a six page abstract (white paper) describing the offerors proposed concept.  Submission of an abstract (white paper) is not required prior to submitting a full proposal.
In their submitted abstracts (white papers) or proposals, offerors should specifically and clearly address both the innovation of their proposed system or subsystem component development, and its impact on military mission efficiency and/or effectiveness.
Offerors are encouraged to review and monitor TTO&rsquo;s public web site at http://www.darpa.mil/TTO in order to better understand past and recent TTO mission systems development efforts.

<DESC>This synopsis has been amended; the change is from a Hub-Zone to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.  

The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the Forest Service contemplates releasing a RFQ solicitation numbered AG-0109-S-09-0018 on or about July 22, 2009 for the Hope Unit 30 Mechanical or Manual Fuel Reduction project.

The purpose of this project is to reduce wildland fire potential near high-use portions of the Community of Cooper Landing, provide for firefighter safety, and secure a safe ingress and egress route to the Kenai Peninsula.  Spruce trees across Alaska have been killed in large numbers by the spruce bark beetle, leaving dead trees across the landscape and creating a high risk for wildland fire.  Implementation of these treatments would substantially reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire igniting or carrying through these portions of the Chugach National Forest.

The contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, fuel, oil, transportation and supplies to perform mechanical fuel reduction work on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest. 
Mechanical or Hand fuel reduction will take place in the Hope Unit 30 project area, adjacent to the Hope Highway. 
Provide salvageable wood products to the publics by whole tree yarding and pileing salvageable trees on landings.
The average fuel load for the Hope Highway project area is estimated at 10 tons per acre. (min 0.3, max 42) Bidders are encouraged to make their own estimates of amount of vegetation to be treated.  
Access roads listed on the contract map are present but may not be suitable for all season use. Service landings and decking areas shall be approved prior to construction. Equipment shall not be operated when ground conditions are such that excessive damage will result.
Contractor may be required to work within close proximity of overhead, electrical distribution lines.  State, Federal and Industry safety-code requirements relevant to working within a certain proximity of power-lines are applicable to the work described in this contract and must be strictly adhered to.  It is the Contractors responsibility to obtain such information and/or documentation.
Units south of the Hope Highway are highest priority and shall be completed before work is started on units north of the Hope Highway.

The performance period is from September 15, 2009 to March 15, 2010

This project is being advertised as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-a-side.  Contractors must be certified through the Small Business Administration as Hub-Zone to be considered for this project.

The solicitation and drawings will be available for downloading at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about July 22, 2009.  Offers will be due approximately 30 calendar days after the solicitation issue date.  It will be the responsibility of the bidder to check FedBizOpps for any amendments to the solicitation or this announcement. 

PLEASE DON'T RETURN THIS NOTICE TO US TO RECEIVE THE SOLICITATION.  GO TO FEDBIZOPPS TO DOWNLOAD THE SOLICITATION.

AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATION:  By registering to receive notification on posted synopses, you will be automatically notified via email of any changes to the project.

Telonics Company has been providing telemetry equipment for the Atlantic Large Whale Disentanglement Network for just over 10 years.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW theformat in FAR Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional informationincluded in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;proposal is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.Solicitation number N65236-09-R-0096 is issued as a RFP.  The items requiredunder this procurement are for the purchasing of approximately seventy-five(75)  new spectrum analyzers and turning in the existing spectrum analyzers,Agilent Model E4407S-E57, currently used for support of Tri-band DMCS Satcomterminals to Model 8564 EC Spectrum Analyzers needed to support the newquad-band DMCS Satcom terminals.  The Agilent spectrum analyzers currentlyin inventory covered the frequency range up to 26.5 GHZ which was sufficientfor the original tri-band (C0, X- and Ku-) DMCS terminals.  However, theseunits are currently being upgraded to add a Ka-Band capability which requires aspectrum analyzer that can cover the frequency at least up to 31.0 HHz.  TheAgilent 8564 EC (OR EQUAL) has a frequency range that covers up to 40 GHzwhich meets the new requirements.FACTOR A:1.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW theformat in FAR Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional informationincluded in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;proposal is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.Solicitation number N65236-09-R-0096 is issued as a RFP.  The items requiredunder this procurement are for the purchasing of approximately seventy-five(75)  new spectrum analyzers and turning in the existing spectrum analyzers,Agilent Model E4407S-E57, currently used for support of Tri-band DMCS Satcomterminals to Model 8564 EC Spectrum Analyzers needed to support the newquad-band DMCS Satcom terminals.  The Agilent spectrum analyzers currentlyin inventory covered the frequency range up to 26.5 GHZ which was sufficientfor the original tri-band (C0, X- and Ku-) DMCS terminals.  However, theseunits are currently being upgraded to add a Ka-Band capability which requires aspectrum analyzer that can cover the frequency at least up to 31.0 HHz.  TheAgilent 8564 EC (OR EQUAL) has a frequency range that covers up to 40 GHzwhich meets the new requirements.FACTOR A:1.

If a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated with the best qualified Offeror, negotiations will be formally terminated. Negotiations may then be undertaken with the second most qualified Offeror and so forth.</p>
<p>The selection of the Contractor will be based on the following criteria:</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. This action is a Work Authorization issued under M&O Contract number DE-AC05-00OR22800 which is funded by Recovery Act dollars.  The description of the work involved under this Work Authorization is as follows:

The current American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) scope of work is awarded under an existing M&O contract and consists of the demolition of five facilities, the removal of legacy material in part or total from 2 facilities, decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of a filter housing in a single facility, and the remediation of two facilities/areas.  Specific projects include: Removal of All Legacy Material from 9201-5 (Alpha-5); Removal of Legacy Material from the second floor of 9204-4 (Beta-4); Demolition of Buildings 9211, 9220, 9224, 9769; Deactivation and Demolition of Building 9206 bag filter house and associated recovery furnace; Demolition of Building 9735; Salvage Yard Remediation; and West End Mercury Area (Storm Sewer) Remediation. The actual Work Authorization Directive will be posted at http://www.doeal.gov/mocd/Y12T.aspx under modification M186 on or before July 17, 2009.  


Justification for Non-Fixed Price and/or competitive award: Contract clause DEAR 970.5243-11 Changes (December 2000), of the contract authorizes the Contracting Officer to make changes within the general scope of the M&O contract. The work scope considered for acceleration as a result of the receipt of the ARRA funds is clearly within the scope of the contract. The prospects for performing the ARRA scope of work under a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract were considered prior to issuance of the modification.  The work contemplated is highly complex and many variables exist that do not lend themselves to the use of a fixed-price contract (FAR 16.601(c)).  NNSA Y-12 Site Office has communicated to the M&O contractor that FFP subcontracts shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible in accomplishing the work executed with ARRA funding. 
				
Place of Contract Performance: Y-12 National Security Complex, Oak Ridge, TN

<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN <br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>Department of the Air Force, 6th Contracting Squadron/LGCB, 2606 Brown Pelican Avenue, MacDill AFB, FL 33621-5000.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>The action being processed is for a Brand Name, firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of SyncSort Backup Express (BEX) Advanced Recovery for Exchange. The estimated value of this contract will be $15,766.00.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>MARCENT has the requirement to quickly and correctly restore individual mailboxes, messages, or attachments to messages from Microsoft Exchange. SyncSort BEX Advanced Recovery for Exchange works within the existing MARCENT backup/disaster recovery solution which backs up the information stored vice individual mailboxes. This additional add-on software will support approximately 1500 mailboxes for SIPRNET and NIPRNET users. It will also included a 3 yrs maintenance.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competitions is 10 USC 2304(c)(1)(c), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, and FAR 11.104 and 11.105.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Marine Central Command (MARCENT) currently utilizes SyncSort Backup Express for bare metal restore capability. BEX Advanced Recovery for Exchange (ARE) is an add-on component to the existing software that enhances the capabilities with no additional training or hardware investment required. Similar products from other vendors would still require additional training investments and would not necessarily be compatible with the existing backup infrastructure. To replace all existing recovery solution backups will a different one so the additonal software could be purchased at the start of the procument would far exceed the cost of just the additional software. The additional cost to the government would exceed the amount of this request; furthermore, substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>To ensure Genuine SyncSort software is received, only SyncSort authorized resellers will be contacted through GSA.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer shall determine the price offered to be fair and reasonable through:<br />a. Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(iv)).<br />b. Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(v)).<br />c. Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(vi)).<br /><br />VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH<br />WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>Market research was conducted by searching GSA Advantage for anyone carrying SyncSort. GSA revealed 1 business that could quote on this.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>HQ MARCENT is committed to the competitive spirit in all procurement regulations. It is MARCENT's policy to seek full and open competition to meet Command requirements when such competition does not impede mission imperatives. MARCENT will continue seeking sources through market research, industry events, vender demonstrations, and testing of products to foster full and open competition. New requirements and functionalities definitely elevate our desire to seek full and open competition considering all possible sources in ensuring MARCENT gets the "best technical solution".</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION<br />As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete (FAR 6.303-2(b)).</p>
