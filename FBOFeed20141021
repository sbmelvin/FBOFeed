<DESC>Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) and Use Case for physiological monitoring in the Air Force, DoD, and civilian sectors are broad and ever-expanding. The main drivers for this expansion are the substantial progress being made in the medical and performance monitoring community identifying key markers, and the technological advances of sensors and computing enabling realization of new devices. The need for reliable sensors to monitor and fuse biometric and biomarker data associated with human performance is the first step to developing a predictive model that would allow detection of predictive markers before actual degradation of performance in the warfighter is evident. The ability to simultaneously determine the levels of biomarkers along with biometrics such as ECG, HR, SpO2, NIBP, and/or respiration rates is a new paradigm in continuous performance monitoring. Combining biomarker data with biometrics results in a more accurate and complete predictive capability of human performance monitoring. A sensor device that can measure temperature, electrolytes glucose lactic acid, and multiple biomarkers such as Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Neuropeptide Y (NP-Y), and Cortisol is desired.
<p>To date, the ability to continuously probe human bio-fluids, such as sweat, has shown limitations. In order to be useful as a means for performance monitoring, fluids would need to be continuously collected, prepared or processed in a manner to allow identification and measurement of suitable bio-markers, with the resultant measurement reported. Ultimately, this will likely be accomplished via microfluidic collection.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved sources are:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Parker Hannifin (62144)</span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. </span></p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

GENERAL INFORMATION:

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), is conducting a Market Survey to improve the Governments understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified and capable sources.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Offer (RFO) of any kind.  At this time, Communications & Power Industries (CPI), is the only known responsible source that can refurbish Reflective Transmit/Receive Limiters (TRL), which incorporate Sensitivity Time Control (STC), NSN 5840-01-363-6420, CPI part number VDC1120.

Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities to meet requirements to refurbish Reflective Transmit/Receive Limiters (TRL), which incorporate Sensitivity Time Control (STC).  The acquisition strategy for this procurement has not been determined.  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the Source List to be used when the solicitation for this requirement is issued, and will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Business; or open it up for full and open competition; or justification of single source.  Any interested sources need to respond to this market survey.  The information identified from this market survey may result in a restricted screening process when the RFO is issued.  Decisions will be made based on the information provided by vendors responding to this market survey.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only.

BACKGROUND

The Transmit/Receive Limiter, with Sensitivity Time Control (TRL/STC) is used in the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) system.  The TDWR is a wind-shear detection system used to increase the safety of the National Airspace System (NAS).  Currently, 45 TDWRs are commissioned at the largest airports vulnerable to wind shear.  The TDWR also detects gust fronts, precipitation, and micro-bursts in the terminal aircraft approach.  This contract action will provide refurbishment of existing TRL/STC units. 

The TR limiters must adhere to the configuration baselines as defined in the FAA National Airspace System and Department of Defense documentation.  This contract is needed as a follow on to an existing contract with CPI for TR limiter refurbishment to ensure continued supply support to the field.  

Varian Associates Inc.; now Communications & Power Industries (CPI) originally designed, developed, and manufactured the TRL/STC units, which were procured by the FAA when the TDWR systems were initially fielded.  Raytheon developed the TDWR system and sub-contracted with Varian Associates Inc. to provide the TRL/STC units to be used with the TDWR system.  Varian (CPI) was the original TR limiter equipment manufacturer, and continues to retain all documentation, processes, and procedures necessary to safely accomplish refurbishment of the TRL/STC.  The FAA does not have any specifications or drawings available for release.   

CPI has unlimited access to the proprietary data necessary to accomplish refurbishment and operational testing of the TRL/STC units.  The proprietary data rights exclusively available to CPI include all manufacturing specification data.

The intent of this market survey is to permit companies that may possess the technical capabilities to provide refurbishment of the Reflective Transmit/Receive Limiters (TRL), which incorporate Sensitivity Time Control (STC) an opportunity to provide specific information as to their unique capabilities as specified in this announcement. Qualified vendors will need to show capability to furnish all required labor, plant, materials, fixtures, equipment, tools, test equipment, technical data/expertise and all other facilities necessary to provide refurbishment of the Government-owned items.

NOTE:  THE FAA DOES NOT HAVE ANY SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION TO PROVIDE SOURCES THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN BECOMING A SOURCE OF REFURBISHMENT FOR THE TRANMSIT/RECEIVE LIMITER/STC.

RESPONSE TO THIS MARKET SURVEY:

Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.

Interested sources should provide evidence of qualifications/capabilities available to provide experienced qualified management and technical personnel to conduct the required services.

A draft Statement of Work is attached to this market survey.

Response submittals must include information for the following two (2) requests:

1.  Vendor responses will describe the resources available to meet the description set forth in this market survey and provide documentation that clearly demonstrates that the interested vendor is qualified and capable of providing the required services.  The format of the documentation is at the discretion of the vendor.

2.  Completed and signed Business Declaration Form (attached) for descriptive information regarding the business status of the vendor.

All response submittals (one response per company) are to be provided with a cover letter on company letterhead.  Responses must be received no later than 3:00 P.M, local time October 31, 2014.  Market survey responses received after the time and date specified may be determined to be late and may not be considered.

All response submittals, including attachments, shall be submitted electronically to the following email address:  connie.m.houpt@faa.gov, Reference: TRL/STC Market Survey.  

All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this market survey.  Therefore, any costs associated with vendors market survey submissions will be solely at the interested vendors expense.

All FAA documents are to be downloaded and printed from the FAA Contracting Opportunities web site found at http://faaco.faa.gov (or by access through http://fast.faa.gov).  Please note that documents downloaded from sites other than the FAAs Contracting Opportunities web site may not be the latest documents.  

Only vendors that respond with information packages providing the required information demonstrating that their firm meets the minimum requirements will be added to the Source List for this requirement.

NOTE:  Any contract awarded for the requirements above will contain the AMS Clause 3.3.1-33 System for Award Management (August 2012).  Award cannot be made to a vendor that has not accomplished this registration.  See paragraph (d) of the clause below:

***(d) If the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern Service Area, is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to gain understanding of the current marketplace and to identify responsible, capable sources. Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set this requirement aside for Small Businesses.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1 for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  This survey will be utilized for acquisition planning, as well as to determine if there are any responsible small businesses capable of performing this project.

This Market Survey is for Roof Replacement and an Area of Siding at the Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), Hampton, GA. All responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals at this time. Presently, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  Upon solicitation the FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAs 8(a) Program.  

All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received in response to this Market Survey. Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.

The FAA is seeking responsible contractors interested in providing Offers for the Roof Replacement and an Area of Siding at the Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), Hampton, GA.   The anticipated period of performance is sixty (60) DAYS.

SECTION I:  DESCRIPTION OF WORK TO BE PERFORMS:

Project Description:  
       -	Replace approximately 3800 square feet of an existing roof system with a
Thermoplastic Polyolefin (TPO) membrane roofing system with an R30 insulating value.  Replace four existing roof drains, with new drain bowls and strainers. Adjust the scuppers to the new roofing system height. Remove and install new lighting 	protection for this roof section. Install new fall protection for this section.
-	Replace approximately 2300 square feet of existing roof system with a Thermoplastic Polyolefin membrane roofing system with a R30 insulating value. Replace the two existing roof drains with new drain bowl and strainer. Adjust the scuppers to the new roofing system height. Remove and install new lighting protection for this roof section.. Install new fall protection for this section.

The estimated price range is between $100,000 to $250,000.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238160.

This market survey will serve as a market analysis to assist the FAA in determining which procurement method to use.  The failure to obtain adequate responses from responsible SBA 8(a) firms or other small businesses may result in the determination to conduct this procurement action under full and open competition.

SECTION II  CAPABILITY STATEMENT:  In order to make this determination the FAA requires the submission of the following information from interested vendors: 

All respondents must provide a Capability Statement that addresses the following (in order):

a.   Type of services provided by interested firm that demonstrate its ability to perform the services described in the Project Description.

b.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to The Jackson Laboratory, 600 Main Street, Bar Harbor, ME 04609-1500 to provide mouse quarantine and housing services, embryo rederivation services, and cryopreservation and storage for the Animal Program of the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Animal Program of the NHLBI DIR manages the supply of animals used for research within the DIR. Due to strict national animal care quality standards, and to meet the peculiar needs of medical research, all animals and animal samples must be handled by certified personnel. Similarly, all equipment used in the storage and transportation of animals and animal samples must meet certain specifications. It is extremely expensive to maintain the proper facilities and certified personnel in-house.</p>
<p>The Animal Program requires that all of its animals and animal samples be maintained according to strict industry and NIH standards. Current space limitations cause the Animal Program to store its animals and animal samples offsite. Long term storage of animals and animal samples in offsite locations has also proven to be a secure and cost-effective strategy for the NHLBI.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is for a contractor to provide support for mouse quarantine and housing services, embryo rederivation services, and cryopreservation and storage.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following support services:</p>
<p>-	Mouse quarantine / housing services;<br />-	Embryo rederivation services; and,<br />-	Cryopreservation services.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance will be one (1) year with potential for two (2) option years.</p>
<p>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>Not applicable</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the fact that the NHLBI has worked with The Jackson Laboratory to transport and store animals and animal samples for over five (5) years. Hundreds of animals and animal samples owned by the NHLBI currently reside with The Jackson Laboratory in their facilities. In order to ensure the continued maintenance of the government's samples, the Animal Program must renew its service agreement with The Jackson Laboratory.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 112990, All Other Animal Production, and the Small Business Size Standard is $0.75M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-77 (October 14, 2014).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<CONTACT>Jerl S. Traylor, Contracting Officer, Phone 2024026131, Email JerL.S.Traylor@hud.gov
<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice for an upcoming solicitation. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this synopsis. The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the public that a formal solicitation will be released on or around October 31, 2014. This will be a total small business set-aside under NAICS 541618 and PSC R710.
<p><br />The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Federal Housing Administration (FHA) seeks expert analytical and related services to inform risk management, budget and related policy decisions with respect to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF). The Contractor will inform MMIF decisions through a series of risk management and financial reports to be known as Risk Management and Capital Assessment Projections (RMCAP). RMCAP's purpose is to ensure that the cash flows, net assets and valuations arising from the mortgage insurance and federal credit reform transactions of the MMIF and the level, direction and implications of the risks to the MMIF are made appropriately transparent and comprehensible as a basis for decisions.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring, valuing and reporting on past, present and probable future risks to the accumulated net assets and contractual cash flows and valuations associated with MMIF insurance operations and federal credit reform transactions as described in Exhibit 1 (MMIF Balance Sheet Line Items) and Exhibit 2 (MMIF Cash Activity Line Items). The Contractor will also monitor probable MMIF capital ratios, provide menu-driven and extended policy analyses, information for FHA's annual report, analyses of independent actuarial reports, budget estimates and re-estimates and associated report storage and retrieval.</p>
<p>Transactions associated with the FHA's guarantee programs for single-family mortgages are recorded in an account of the federal government known as the MMIF. FHA has insured 27.4 million mortgages through the MMIF since federal credit reform went into effect in 1992 of which 852,000 are reverse mortgages and roughly 8 million are active and on which aggregate insurance in force was $1.17 trillion as of 9/30/13. Cash flows on these insurance policies result from both FHA's insurance operations and from transactions mandated by federal credit reform. Aggregate MMIF cash flows and balances are reported monthly for the line items shown in the Exhibits below. Underwriting, servicing and property disposition information on FHA-insured loans and the resulting cash flows and accumulated net assets of the insurance operation resides on multiple systems.</p>
<p>The RMCAP will have a monthly operating cycle in which appropriate information is drawn from FHA and other appropriate sources, evaluated, processed, analyzed, reviewed and reported. (Information drawn from FHA is the transfer of data the contractor might need from FHA. This pertains specifically to the FHA data subject to the MMI Fund for which RMCAP is requesting valuation and risk modeling. The data and frequency FHA will execute the transfers to the contractor will depend of what kind of data the contractor will need from FHA. It is anticipated these data will be transferred on a regular basis preferably monthly.) The Contractor will identify differences between previously forecast and subsequent actual values and evaluate them for out-of -tolerance outcomes requiring adjustments to models. New reports and forecasts will be generated after the current accuracy and reliability of the information has been established.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide sound and effective model risk management to RMCAP in accordance with principles and standards such as those established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (AB-2013-07-Model-Risk-Management-Guidance) and The Federal Reserve Board and The Comptroller of the Currency (Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management). The Contractor must also develop, document, operate and manage the RMCAP in accordance with all applicable OMB Circulars (A-11, A-123 and A-129 (OMB Circulars)), and all applicable Federal Accounting and Audit Standards (FASAB Handbook).</p>

The CBID II Statement of Work (SOW) describes the scope of requirements anticipated, while individualized Performance Based Work Statements (PBWSs or PWSs) will specifically define requirements at the delivery or task order level.   <br>  <br> The solicitation number for the CBID II requirement has been updated to reflect the current fiscal year (FY 15) and will be posted as W900KK-15-R-0006.  Solicitation number W900KK-13-R-0017 is obsolete, for the purpose of responding to the CBID II requirement. <br>  <br> The Government intends to solicit this requirement as a competitive total small business set-aside.  CBID II is a supply centric effort (e.g. delivery of interactive multimedia instruction (a.k.a. courseware)) with incidental services.  The selected NAICS code for CBID II is 541519, with a size standard of $27.5M.  <br>

<DESC>The proposed project will involve promoting adult fish passage within the fish ladder by providing cooler water supply using deeper forebay withdrawal structures and a modified discharge release structure. Forebay withdrawal structures include a chimney for diffuser 14 and two extension housings, allowing for an intake depth 66 feet below low forebay elevation. The discharge release for Auxiliary pumps 1 and 2 will be modified to include additional piping and support structure on the face of the dam, allowing the discharge from both pumps to be combined and discharged over the exit of the fish ladder. <br>  <br> The contract will include the following: <br>  <br>  	The fabrication and installation of diffuser 14 chimney with an overall height, width and depth of 76 X 13 X 6 feet respectively. The overall weight of the diffuser 14 painted steel chimney is estimated at 40,000 lbs and will be secured to the face of the dam with mechanical anchorage bolts.  <br>  <br>  	The fabrication and installation of auxiliary pumps 1 and 2 intake extension housings, which are 36 inch diameter fiberglass pipes with a length of 38 feet; both including a 36 to 60 inch transition bell with flange, allowing the use of mechanical anchorage bolts to secure housing extensions to dam.  <br>  <br>  	The rotation of auxiliary pumps 1 and 2 (medium voltage) and the modification of power supply allowing for operation in either the contract or original orientation.  <br>  <br>  	The fabrication and installation of the discharge release structure for auxiliary pumps 1 and 2,  which includes the support and routing of pipe with diameters ranging from 20 to 30 inches and with an overall length of piping estimated at 35 feet mounted to the face of the dam.  <br>  <br>  	The installation and fabrication of an access ladder just south of auxiliary pumps, requiring the modification of handrail and removal of concrete curbing as well as the rerouting of electrical conduit within the immediate vicinity of the access ladder. <br>  <br>  <br> Place of Performance is at the Lower Granite Dam located near Pomeroy, Washington, Garfield County.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine if contractors are capable of meeting the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) requirements for Customer Relationship Management (CRM). This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of the competitive process.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information on capable sources of supply, industry practices, and input specific to the information and questions provided below. The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in furnishing this information. 

Background
The Veteran Relationship Management (VRM) Program was established in response to several key challenges that Veterans, service members, and their dependents experience when seeking information and services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Modernization of our telephony capabilities and our agents' ability to resolve Veterans' issues is a primary focal point of the VRM program.  As such, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) program was established under VRM in response to Secretary Shinseki's interest in having a plan developed that charts a course for transformation of VA call centers.
As a component of the VRM Initiative, the CRM program intends to integrate all of the contact information the VA maintains on its customers.  Also, the CRM program intends to provide VA employees who communicate with VA customers the tools they need to provide every VA customer with consistent and accurate information, as well as rapid and correct issue resolution. 

The Co-Browsing solution under CRM will primarily be used to provide support to the users of VA online portals and electronic claims submission through the eBenefits and Stakeholder Enterprise Portals (SEP) portals. The call center agents will be able to view the browser session of the Veteran when they are assisting the Veteran with their issues.

After reviewing all the information, interested capable contractors are invited to provide responses to the following questions:
?
Functional / General
1.	Can Agents initiate a co-browse session?
2.	Can Users initiate a co-browse session?
3.	Do you offer On Premise Deployment? If so, what are the technical requirements?
4.	Do you offer a Hosted Solution?
5.	Does the solution offer the ability to launch the co-browsing system as a standalone application?
6.	Can the co-browse functionality as a standalone application be integrated with our CRM (Mircosoft Dynamics) for use by contact center agents?   Can you save a transcript of the co-browse session in MS Dynamics?
7.	Does the solution offer the ability to "enable"/launch co-browsing system from a Chat System?

11.	Does the solution offer the ability for an Administrator to restrict/allow access to different co-browsing functionality based on user-specific settings?
12.	Does the solution allow the ability for client and/or agent to disconnect co-browse session at any time?
13.	Does the solution allow the ability to associate an agent to a co-browsing session and to track historical usage based on agent, client, date/time, length of co-browse session, etc.?  What type of pre-defined and ad-hoc reports/analytics are available?
14.	How does the product behave if customer scrolls down to the bottom of the page while agent is at the top of the page?
15.	How does the product behave if the agent gets accidentally dropped from a session? (Can agent can re-connect to the customer's Co-browse session?) 
16.	Does the solution allow business rules that are customizable?  How easy is it to administer the rules?
17.	Are these business rules customizable to specific agent roles?
18.	Does the product support one-to-many co-browsing (supervisor / others that can join co-browse)?
19.	How does your company respond to application changes and new requirements?  How often are new product releases deployed?  What is your innovation strategy?

Co-Browse Technical Requirements
21.	Much of our static content (Style Sheets, CSS files, logos, etc.) resides behind a VA firewall to which neither the agents nor the co-browse application will have access. Can the application pull static content from one location and dynamic content from another? 
22.	Please provide a full list of browsers and their versions that the system supports on both the agent and client side.  Can agents and clients be on different browsers?
23.	Does the solution allow the blocking of certain IP addresses from initiating co-browse sessions dynamically?

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Synopsis</p>
<p>F-16 Program Office<br />Fighter/Bomber Directorate<br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center<br />Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</p>
<p>1. Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Fighter/Bomber Directorate (WW), F-16 Program Contracting Office (WWMK), Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking information on a sustainment upgrade or replacement for the current United States Air Force (USAF) F-16 Blocks 40/42/50/52 Programmable Display Generator (PDG).</p>
<p>1.2 Specifically, the F-16 program office is requesting information on a PDG sustainment upgrade or replacement that can be retrofitted onto the existing USAF F-16 Blocks 40/42/50/52 aircraft without exceeding the current Size Weight and Power Cooling (SWaPC) capabilities. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this potential work is 334511: Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, size standard 750 employees.</p>
<p>2. This Is A Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) Only</p>
<p>2.1 This SSS is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This SSS does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.</p>
<p>2.2 The Air Force is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this SSS. All costs associated with responding to this SSS will be solely at the interested parties' expense.</p>
<p>2.3 Responders shall describe how they meet the requirements listed under the Requirements Description and must fully answer the Contractor Capability Survey portions - Part 1 and Part 2.</p>
<p>2.4 Contractors must be either U.S.-owned or a U.S.-owned subsidiary with valid security infrastructure and clearances to accomplish this effort. Large businesses are encouraged to indicate the extent to which they intend to use small businesses.</p>
<p>2.5 The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>3. If there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a response as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>4. Note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentages.</p>
<p>5. If a company is capable of some, but not all of the consolidated requirements stated in this SSS, please provide a response that explains the requirements for which you are capable.</p>
<p>6. Not responding to this SSS does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website. It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>7. Background</p>
<p>7.1 The PDG provides the ability to drive the displays on the F-16. The Government is investigating the possibility of initiating a USAF F-16 PDG sustainment upgrade or replacement program. The objective would be to develop, produce, and field an upgraded PDG system to address operational requirements and supportability issues, with development beginning in 2015 and production beginning in 2019.</p>
<p>7.2 F-16 combat capabilities have expanded to reach the video processing limits of the current PDG. This PDG upgrade supports future Operational Flight Program (OFP) software sustainment upgrades and will support displaying critical operational information. The current PDG cannot handle the volume of operational information in dynamic mission environments. As a result, it is unable to drive modern cockpit displays or support high definition video; due to memory, throughput, and interface limitations, displays routinely blank critical operational information during high track/data density mission scenarios. Critical components of the PDG are suffering Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, including memory components. Upgraded PDG is required to address the digital display/video processing limitations and support modern high definition displays with sufficient memory and throughput to provide properly functioning displays through the entire dynamic envelope of the aircraft to support future operational capabilities.</p>
<p>7.3 Due to security access, system attributes, and concept of operations, foreign contractor participation is not permitted at the prime contractor level. United States contractors must develop the PDG in the United States of America.</p>
<p>7.4 The planned production is estimated to be 700 PDGs, including spares and trainers.</p>
<p>8. Security requirements will be in accordance with the F-16 Security Classification Guide (SCG) and any other applicable classification guides. Please contact F-16 Program Office if you require a copy of the SCG.</p>
<p>9. Industry Discussions: AFLCMC/WWM representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential respondents. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>10. On the following pages is a description of the PDG upgrade requirements and a Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your company's capability.<br />11. If, after reviewing this information, you desire to respond to the SSS, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability to meet these requirements. Companies may be contacted for further information or clarification; however, failure to provide documentation may result in the U.S. Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how your company would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.). Documentation should be provided in the form of a white paper.</p>
<p>12. Questions related to this market survey should be addressed to the Program Manager, John Weyrick, at 937-713-6515 or the Contracting Officer, Christopher Hampton, at 937-713-6996. Questions regarding classified communications shall be addressed by the Security Officer, Ms. Rachel Garcia at (unclassified) 937-904-7735, for directions to a classified phone line.</p>
<p>13. Please include two complete hard copies of the response, no longer than 25 pages each, along with one softcopy on compact disk-read only. In addition, please send one copy by e-mail no later than close of business 30 calendar days after posting date, to the Contracting Officer, Christopher Hampton, at christophe.hampton@us.af.mil, and to the Contracts Negotiator, Christopher Rittenhouse, at christopher.rittenhouse@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>Type of Notice:
<p>This is a Support Services Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential Support Services requirement.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The mission of the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), National Cancer Institute (NCI), is to define the causal relationships between diet/nutritional status, energy balance, metabolism, lifestyle factors, and cancer. NEB's research encompasses diet, energy balance/obesity/physical activity, specific nutrients and supplements, diet-related additives, contaminants, metabolites, and intermediate biologic markers.</p>
<p>In support of this mission, the Finnish National Institute of Health and Welfare ("NIHW") has and continues to collect health-related data for a large cancer cohort study, the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study, originally conducted in southwestern Finland.  The study population includes all participants (n=29,133 male smokers) from the ATBC Study conducted between 1985 and 1993, originally as a cancer prevention trial testing supplementation with the vitamins beta-carotene and vitamin E.  The ATBC Study has been an integral cohort and scientific resource for the NCI for over two decades.  The originally conducted controlled primary cancer prevention trial of vitamin supplementation collected medical, serial chest x-ray, anthropometric, dietary, smoking, and occupational data, along with highly valuable biospecimens including fasting serum, whole blood, red blood cells, and toenail samples.  Half of the biospecimens are stored by Finnish NIHW in Helsinki.  Post-trial cancer and mortality surveillance of the cohort with essentially complete ascertainment has been maintained through contracts with Finnish government institutions:  first, with the National Public Health Institute, and most recently, the National Institute of Health and Welfare.  The latter institution solely retains personal identifiers, used for all of the cohort's data linkages and medical record access.  The ATBC Study cohort is a valuable biomedical resource for NCI because it:  1) is a relatively large study population; 2) has up to 30 years of follow-up; 3) has complete national registry endpoint and other linkages (having ascertained ~11,000 cancers to date); 4) has stored fasting serum and DNA; and, 5) has high-quality information for other health behavior characteristics such as diet, body weight, smoking, physical activity, and other illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The cohort resources continue to be used by the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Gentics (DCEG)/NCI and other investigators, and the project has been the basis of several hundred high-quality research studies relating to cancer etiology, survival, prevention, and early detection.  The cohort project has also been used to research other health outcomes including cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this acquisition is to provide for the continued health outcome surveillance of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study cohort in Finland.  Access of NCI to cancer patient medical records and blood and tumor tissue biospecimens from the study that are stored in Finland are the other key elements of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:<br />Major tasks of the Contractor include the following:</p>
<p>A.  Identification and Review of Endpoints and Related Data</p>
<p>1. CANCERS</p>
<p>a.   Incident cancers <br />At least annually, identify all incident cancer cases among the ATBC Study participants through linkage with the Finnish Cancer Registry (some may be identified only through Statistics Finland mortality linkage, below).</p>
<p>b.  Cancer case medical record retrieval</p>
<p>Collect, store, and abstract copies of all necessary and relevant medical records from hospitals, clinics, etc. pertaining to a sample of approximately 150 cancer cases identified for targeted cancer sites as selected annually by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) based on timely research priorities. This will include, but not be limited to, discharge summaries, progress notes, surgical and pathology reports, death certificates, reports from clinical examinations and procedures, and relevant laboratory tests.  Provide for review and verification by an oncologist the cancer diagnoses, stage/grade, treatments, and other relevant information for these cases.</p>
<p>2.  DEATHS</p>
<p>a.  At least annually, identify all deaths, including dates and the underlying and contributory causes of death, among members of the ATBC Study cohort through linkage with Statistics Finland and other relevant sources.</p>
<p>3.  OTHER DISEASES AND DATA</p>
<p>a.  As requested by the COR, link the ATBC Study population with the Finnish Hospital Discharge Registry to identify requested diagnoses during hospitalizations up to semi-annually.</p>
<p>b.  As requested by the COR, link the ATBC Study population with the Finnish prescription medication registers to identify type, dosage, calendar years and duration of medication use up to semi-annually.</p>
<p>B.  Biological Specimens</p>
<p>1.  Maintain a system of controlled inventory and storage for the existing baseline toenail samples (room temperature) and the third trial year serum (-70oC to -80oC) from the ATBC Study cohort.</p>
<p>2.  As requested by the COR, and based on ATBC Study participants whose NCI-Frederick serum or whole blood biospecimen samples have been depleted (e.g., case-control sets), package and ship (frozen) to NCI serum or whole blood samples.</p>
<p>3.  As requested by the COR, and based on specific NCI principal investigator needs, collect archived formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumor tissue slides for samples of cancer cases annually based on slide specifications to be provided.</p>
<p>C.  Data Management</p>
<p>1.  Code, key and verify all ATBC Study data acquired under this Contract onto secure computer files maintained at the National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.</p>
<p>2.  Ensure that computerization of these data is conducted in a timely, secure and high-quality manner.</p>
<p>3.  Transmit all these data in secure, computerized formats to the ATBC Study data management center of DCEG, NCI.</p>
<p>D.  Quality Control and Project Coordination</p>
<p>1.  Develop and implement quality control plans to assure high quality in:</p>
<p>a.	Collection, preparation, review and transfer to NCI of registry data and medical records collected under this Contract.</p>
<p>b.	Retrieval, preparation, and shipment of biospecimens collected under this Contract to the NCI.</p>
<p>c.	Storage of all ATBC Study biological specimens maintained in Helsinki by the Contractor.</p>
<p><br />Anticipated Period of Performance:<br />The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is one year, with four one-year options.</p>
<p><br />Other Important Considerations:<br />Only the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (NIHW) holds the personal identifiers for the ATBC Study participants that are required for all the registry data linkages that NCI requires.  Additionaly, only the NIHW:  1) can access the required cancer case medical records from Finnish hospitals and clinics, as well as Finnish death certificates, and, 2) currently stores ATBC Study biospecimens that NCI requires for its research programs.</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information Sought:<br />We encourage all responsible sources, particularly small businesses, to submit a capability statement which will be considered by the agency. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Documented access to this unique cohort population consisting of male Finnish smokers.  This includes holding the personal identifiers for the ATBC Study participants that are required for all the registry data linkages that NCI requires.</p>
<p>2. Documented ability to obtain the necessary IRB approvals for the studies related to the ATBC cohort.</p>
<p>3. Documented infrastructure and training to ascertain cancer cases among members of the ATBC cohort.</p>
<p>4. Documented ability and experience in conducting nation-wide cancer and mortality follow-up through linkage with Finnish national registries and access to medical records from Finnish hospitals and clinics.</p>
<p>Interested qualified organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above.

<DESC>Introduction
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of Intramural Research (DIR) founded the Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV) in 2009 to conduct basic and applied research relevant to malaria immunology and vaccine development, to pursue novel vaccine concepts, to produce prototype malaria vaccines, and to conduct early-phase clinical trials of promising vaccine candidates. The overarching goal is to develop malaria vaccines that will reduce severe disease and death among African children and pregnant women and will eliminate malaria from low-transmission areas of the world.</p>
<p>Malaria is the most prevalent and deadly human parasitic disease, with 220 million cases reported annually resulting in at least 625,000 deaths each year; most cases and deaths are in children under the age of five and pregnant women. Globally, young people constitute a large proportion of new infections and deaths. LMIV fully complies with the regulations of 45 CFR Part 46 Subpart D in the conduct of malaria vaccine trials when considering the inclusion of children. Research studies that involve children will be permitted only if the local IRB finds that the level of risk is no greater than minimal regardless of whether the research offers to prospect of direct benefit to the child. Given the nature of malaria challenge trials and the fact that the risk is more than minimal, evaluation of malaria vaccine candidates in infants and children under 18 is considered too risky in children without first conducting trials on adults. It is therefore the intent of LMIV to perform clinical trials on adults, with the goal of introducing clinical trials in children once the vaccine is proven safe and effective for adults.</p>
<p>LMIV requires clinical trials to investigate initial safety, immunogenicity, and biologic impact of promising vaccine candidates. Clinical studies may also be conducted as part of pathogenesis research to facilitate vaccine development. These may include a Phase 1 Malaria Vaccine Trial, Challenge Studies, and Experimental Infection Studies.</p>
<p>NIAID expects to issue task orders for clinical trials of LMIV's promising vaccine candidates under Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>LMIV requires clinical trials to investigate initial safety, immunogenicity, and biologic impact of promising vaccine candidates. Clinical studies may also be conducted as part of pathogenesis research to facilitate vaccine development. These may include a Phase 1 Malaria Vaccine Trial, Challenge Studies, and Experimental Infection Studies.</p>
<p>Project requirements</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to conduct clinical trials on a task order basis under the guidance of LMIV.</p>
<p>This IDIQ will be administered and used primarily to support NIAID Intramural initiatives. However, other NIAID programs may initiate Task Orders under this IDIQ as necessary to help accomplish their mission.</p>

<DESC>This announcement describes the Solicitation/Request for Offer for the DUATS II acquisition, as well as, provides information regarding other Flight Services acquisitions.  

I.	PURPOSE

The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAAs intent to conduct a limited competition for Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS) II and provide information on Flight Service Station (FSS) and Flight Service Direct (FSD).

II.	FLIGHT SERVICE STATION (FSS)

The FAA intends to conduct a competitive source selection for a new Flight Service Station (FSS) contract that includes the end-state flight service requirements within CONUS, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The anticipated contract award date for a new FSS contract is Q3 FY 17. The end-state requirements will take advantage of existing and developing technologies and result in a more cost effective footprint. It is anticipated the ability for pilots to plan flights, file flight plans, and perform self-briefings via internet -based automated functions will remain as a requirement of the new contract.  The estimated period of performance for the new contract is anticipated to be one (1) three-year base period and seven (7) one-year options. 	

In the interim, the FAA requires current internet-based automated flight service functions provided under DUATS to continue until the functionality is provided solely under the new competitive FSS contract. The competed DUATS II contract will be subsumed by the new FSS contract. 

III.	DIRECT USER ACCESS TERMINAL SERVICE (DUATS) II

The FAA intends to conduct a limited competition between the three incumbent service providers (Computer Science Corporation (CSC), Data Transformation Corporation (DTC), and Lockheed Martin) with operational internet-based automated pre-flight flight service systems that can meet the DUATS II requirements, are compliant with FAA Security requirements, and will be operational on March 17, 2015. The period of performance for the resulting contract(s) will be one (1) one-year base period and four (4) one-year options.

Both of the current DUATS contracts (Contracts DTFAWA-08-C-00119 and DTFAWA-08-00121, with CSC and DTC, respectively) expire on March 16, 2015. No additional option periods are available. The FAA requires a fully operational DUATS II system on March 17, 2015.  

The FAA is considering a limited competition between the three incumbent service providers due to security requirements that must be met for a DUATS II system to be operational in the NAS in accordance FAA Order 1370.82A. The estimated time for a new vendor to achieve FAA Security Certification & Authorization is at least 6-9 months. Time to conduct these security activities is not available.

Only the three current operational systems can meet the DUATS II requirements, are compliant with FAA Security requirements, and will be able to be operational by March 17, 2015. These systems are provided under the current DUATS contracts and the Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) contract (Contract DTFAWA-05-C-00031).

IV.	FLIGHT SERVICE DIRECT (FSD) 

The DUATS II acquisition is being conducted instead of a FSD acquisition

V.	QUESTIONS

This announcement is for informational purposes only and not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal. Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed, in writing, to Patrick Weare, Contracting Officer, via email at patrick.weare@faa.gov by 3:00 PM EST, October 31, 2014.

<DESC>The Department of Energy, Procurement Services Division, Acquisitions Office, extended a Task Order by means other than full and open competition.  An approved Limited Source Justification sets forth the justification and approval for award of a Federal Supply Schedule order on a Limited-Source basis as required by FAR 8.405-6.  Per FAR section FAR8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), in the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order.  The original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures and was not previously issued under sole-source or limited sources procedures.  All Schedule awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.  This justification is in the support of a new follow-on FSS order, for a period of 30-days, to IBM.  The services currently being performed under this contract were previously awarded to TMS, who was later bought  out by IBM.  This task order extension is a logical follow-on, as it will not change the scope of work being performed.  Moreover, the work to be performed during the extension period is a continuation of the services already being provided by IBM.  No new tasks will be added.  FE has initiated competition for the successor contract to the current task order and currently is in the process of discussions to maximize the Government?s ability to obtain best value.  The competitive solicitation for the successor contract was released on December 13, 2013 and five offerors responded. A successful offeror was received and award was made on September 16, 2014. On September 22, 2014 a SBA Size Protest was received, by the Contracting Officer, protesting the size of the successful offeror.  Performance under the successful award will be halted until a resolution to the protest is received.   This extension is necessary to provide the required continuity of services for achievement of FE?s  mission objectives without interruption during the evaluation and award phase of the successor contract.  The dollar value of this action is $318,967.00 and the ceiling value reamins unchanged.  This special notice is not a solicitation for firms to submit proposals.  The above is the summary of the sole source justification.  To receive a pdf copy of the approved Limited Source Justification please contact Carrie N. Brown, carrie.brown@hq.doe.gov.

The contract underwent a re-compete and a new contract was awarded to ADS on September 16, 2014.  On September 22, 2014 a size protest was filed with the Smail Business Administration.  IBM is the only source available to perform the stated requirements of the SOW from October 31, 2014 to end of the protest process, estimated to be 3 to 6 months.  The dollar value of this action (including options) is $1,851,991.00.  This special notice is not a solicitation for firms to submit proposals.  The above is the summary of the sole source justification.  To receive a pdf copy of the approved Limited Source Justification please contact Carrie N. Brown, carrie.brown@hq.doe.gov.

<DESC><p>The following SPECIAL NOTICE is of a REDACTED GSA Justification For Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC)</p>
<p>Limited Source Justification</p>
<p>"Source Selection Information - see FAR 2.101 and 3.104"</p>
<p>1. Identification of the agency and contracting activity. <br /><br />a. Federal agency and contracting activity. HHS/NIH/National Cancer Institute (NCI) <br />b. Sponsoring organization. Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL)/Office of the Director <br />c. Project Officer information. <br /><br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <br />a. Acquisition purpose and objectives. This requirement is to enter into a four-month "bridge" contract to allow time to re-compete, OCPL's transition communication support services, and transition these services to a new awardee, if necessary, as well as to continue to provide the needed communication support services. The new services will be acquired through a competitive GSA solicitation. <br />b. Project background. The current five-year ID/IQ contract (HHSN261200800017I) was awarded to Ogilvy Public Relations on September 25, 2008 as the result of a competitive GSA acquisition to provide communications support services, including media and science writing support to OCPL and to NCI's Divisions, Offices, and Centers. This contract was made available, via task orders, to the entire NCI communications community in an effort to reduce the number of communication support contracts in NCI. The contract expired on September 25, 2013 and the last remaining task orders issued under the contract will expire in October 24, 2014. To date, the total obligated amount for all task orders is $__. <br /><br />3. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). <br /><br />a. Project title. Communications Support Services for the National Cancer Institute <br />b. Project description. The Contractor shall provide communications related support to the NCI in the following two areas: (1) Communications Planning and Implementation; and (2) Public Affairs (including media related support). <br />During the life of the interim contract, the Contractor shall provide basic communication services such as communications guidance and strategic planning, developing media plans, media monitoring, developing and implementing disseminations plans, media outreach and training, technical writing and editing, and stakeholder capacity building.&nbsp;<br /><br />1. Requirement type. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">X&#61553; Support services (non-research &amp; development) <br /></span>&#61553; Supplies/equipment<br />&#61553; Information technology (IT) <br />&#61553;</p>
<p>2. Type of action. &#61553; New requirement <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">X&#61553; Follow-on<br /></span>&#61553;<br />3. Proposed contract/order type. <br />&#61553; Firm-fixed-price <br />&#61553; Time and materials<br />&#61553; Indefinite delivery (specify whether indefinite quantity, definite quantity, or requirements): ___________ <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">X&#61553; Other (specify): labor hour<br /><br /></span>4. Acquisition identification number. Requisition number: 3532263 <br /><br />c. Total estimated dollar value and performance/delivery period. Period of performance shall be for four months from: <br />September 25, 2014 thru January 30, 2015. Estimated dollar amount is $__&nbsp;. <br /><br />4. Identification of the justification rationale [see 8.405-6(a) and (b)] and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.</p>
<p>a. Acquisition authority. <br /><br />X&#61553; This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. Consideration of schedule contractors will be restricted to fewer than the number required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(a)(1) (i.e., fewer than three FSS contractors).</p>
<p>&#61553; This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. Consideration of schedule contractors will be restricted only to the item peculiar to one manufacturer as provided in FAR 8.405-6(a)(2).</p>
<p>b. Demonstration of the proposed contractor(s) unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service. <br /><br />Name and address of the proposed contractor(s). <br />Ogilvy Public Relations<br />111 19th Street, NW <br />10th floor<br />Washington, DC 20036</p>
<p>Nature of the acquisition and proposed contractor(s) unique qualifications. The current contractor, Ogilvy Public Relations, has been providing communications support services to the NCI research and scientific community for the past five years. They are uniquely qualified to continue to provide these services on an interim basis due to their years of research and knowledge regarding the ongoing tasks, their knowledge of the preparation of the annual report, as well as their background knowledge of operations. The need to train staff and ramp up does not exist. However, if a new contractor was retained, the learning curve would be too great to become acclimated to the ongoing tasks and it would be cost prohibitive to train new staff. In addition, communicating important science information would be delayed.</p>
<p>5. Determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d). For the interim order, the use of the incumbent contractor represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs.</p>
<p>6. Description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results, or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted. No market research was conducted because OA intends to sole source this requirement to Oglivy through GSA. <br /><br />7. Any other facts supporting the justification. No other facts.<br /><br />8. Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.<br />&nbsp;<br />a. Removal of barriers to competition. An open GSA Schedule 541 solicitation for communication support services will be held during the life of the interim contract. The interim delivery order is intended to permit time for a full and open competition through the GSA schedule 541, continue to provide the needed communication services to the institute, and ensure a smooth transition.<br />&nbsp;<br />b. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed an interest, in writing, in the acquisition. -Not applicable.</p>

<a href="mailto:LaMaster.Anthony@epa.gov">LaMaster.Anthony@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue an extension of services on a sole source basis. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 7, Superfund Program intends to issue an extension of services on a sole source basis to allow time for implementation of a strategic sourcing opportunity for the next round of Remedial Action Framework Response Action Contracts (RACs). Strategic sourcing is endorsed by the Administrator of EPA and works toward the President mandate on more effective contracting. A modification under the small business Architect and Engineering Services (AES) contract EP-S7-05-05 will be issued to extend services as allowed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 only one responsible source. The extension will be to the original contract placed under competitive Brooks Act procedures. A need for these services exists as waiting for the Agency to finalize the new Superfund Remedial Acquisition Strategy procurements would result in unaccept able delays for on-going projects initiated for the protection of human health and the environment from contaminant hazards.

This extension is only to address the immediate need and upon issuance of the follow on contract, work will be transitioned accordingly. It is anticipated the procurement administrative lead time to place the follow on contract may take up to one year. If however the contract is available within less than one year, the work will be transitioned to the new contracts as appropriate.

Information on the follow on contract is included in the Sources Sought/Request for Information (SSRFI) which has been posted to FedBizOpps at the following link: https://www.fbo.gov/spg/EPA/OAM/3PM10/SOL-R3-13-00006/listing.html

Referenced contract is scheduled to expire on 03/31/2015 which pre-dates new contract awards being made under the Agency's new Superfund Remedial Contracting Framework. As evidenced by the recent posting of the SSRFI, sufficient time does not exist to initiate and complete a Brooks Act competition for Architect and Engineering Services under FAR Part 36. A break in service poses significant risk considering the nature of the services that are currently being performed under the AES contract. In order to avoid such a break in service, EPA Region 7 is issuing an up to twelve month ( 1 year) extension to the current AES contract which will provide sufficient coverage until a competitively awarded replacement contract can be awarded which reflects the EPA's new Remedial Contracting Framework Strategy.

This modification will be to extend services under this non-personal services contract EP-S7-05-05. The contract was awarded competitively on 03/31/2005. The modification to extend services up to an additional twelve months (1 year) performance period will not increase the contract ceiling. The level of service that will be provided is in accordance with the existing contract Statement of Work (SOW), but has been significantly reduced from the original contract amount. Under the existing contract EP-S7-05-05, the contractor provides environmental architect and engineering services and has the experience and capability to continue to provide such services during the extension period, thus preventing any break in service and increased risk to human health and the environment from exposure to environmental contaminant hazards.

THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION FOR FOLLOW-ON WORK UNDER THE REFERENCED CONTRACT. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITATION FOR THE FOLLOW-ON UP TO 12 MONTH EXTENSION WILL BE PROVIDED. The determination not to compete this action is solely within the discretion of the EPA Region 7 as continuance of service under the referenced contract represents the best decision to meet the Government's need without causing significant financial harm, creating unnecessary delays, and damaging going enforcement and community engagement actions. The EPA Region 7 will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. This notice in no way obligates the EPA Region 7 to award the up to 12 month extension of services, sole source modification of subject contract. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than 11/05/2014 by 12:00 p.m. CST to Anthony LaMaster, Contracting Officer v ia email at lamaster.anthony@epa.gov. The current SOW for these services is provided as an attachment to this notice. Responses to this notice must demonstrate evidence that clearly and convincingly that competition of the up to 12 month extension would be advantageous to the Government and would not hamper EPA objectives.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information.

However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error. <BR> <BR>(a) Any system hardware, software, firmware and/or networked component (voice, video or data) developed, procured, or acquired in support and/or performance of this contract shall be capable of transmitting, receiving, processing, forwarding and storing digital information across system boundaries utilizing system packets that are formatted in accordance with commercial standards of Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 (IPv6) as set forth in the IJSGv6 Profile (KIST Special Publication 500-267) and corresponding declarations of conformance defined in the USGv6 Test Program.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical, Past Performance and Price. (b) Options.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair or overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair or overhaul as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair/overhaul of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-15-Q-010011 is assigned for tracking purposes only.

<DESC><p>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information. This solicitation is pursuant to FAR subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. The Government requests quotations and will not issue a separate written solicitation. Solicitation information and amendments will post to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), located at 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134, has a requirement to procure a Scout Sniper Day Scope Improved Mount (SSDS-IM). The SSDS-IM is a one-piece mounting solution that does not require the use of tools for rail attachment for the following weapon platforms: M110 and M107. The SSDS-IM is a commercial item under FAR 2.101 because several offerors offer similar improved mount systems for sale to the general public that can potentially meet the performance specifications for this effort. Per FAR 2.101, a commercial item is any item, other than real property, that is of a type customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes, and has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; or has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public. By conducting market research, the Marine Corps learned that the general public uses a one-piece mounting solution on commercially purchased rifles that have the same rail mechanism for mounting as the Marine Corps M110 &amp; M107 rifles. To offer the one-piece mounting solution to the general public, several vendors who manufacture the one-piece mounting solution list the item for sale via internet websites for mail delivery and offer items in retail sportsman stores.</p>
<p>Based on market research, at least two responsible small businesses, competing independently are capable of fulfilling this requirement at reasonable prices and can meet the delivery schedule. Therefore, this requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses. The Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) and the Associate Director for Small Business Programs concur this requirement is 100% set aside for small business.</p>
<p>The solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ) M67854-14-T-1038. This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-77.

All interested and responsible parties shall refer to www.fbo.gov for all documents pertaining to this RFQ. The award for the SSDS-IM will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Purchase Order.<br /><br />MARCORSYSCOM intends to procure two SSDS-IM variants as specified in the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) below.<br />CLIN 0001-SSDS-IM 1&frac12; inch height, with 20 Minutes of Angle (MOA) Bias for the M110 weapon platform, in accordance with (IAW) Performance Specification (PSPEC) dated 19 December 2013, <br />Quantity: 1,377 <br />Unit of Issue: Each</p>

Each visit to PBA shall be for a 2 hour period from 9:00AM to 11:00AM local time on each date specified in the resultant BPA.    <br>        <br>    Emergency services may be required within 48 hours of request.    <br>        <br>    EVALUATION FOR AWARD:    <br>        <br>    In accordance with FAR 12.602, streamlined evaluation procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  Award will be made to the offeror who provides the lowest total evaluated price, who is deemed responsible, and who is compliant with all the requirements of this solicitation, to include submission requirements listed under  quote mark Quote Submission Requirements quote mark  below.  Award will be made on a Firm Fixed Price basis.  Price evaluation is as follows:    <br>        <br>    1. The offeror will enter unit prices for all shoe styles for the base year and each evaluated option year on the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet's first tab titled Summary of Unit Prices.  All unit prices shall be binding.    <br>        <br>    2. The Government reserves the right to require submission of any data necessary to validate the reasonableness of an offer.    <br>        <br>    3. Based on procurement history, the majority of purchases have been for the 8 shoe styles found on the second tab of the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet titled Pricing Matrix.  The Government will evaluate offers based on unit prices proposed for these 8 shoe styles on the base year and each evaluated option year.  If an offeror fails to propose all of the unit prices for the base and evaluated option years, the Government may reject that offer as unacceptable.    <br>        <br>    4. For each proposal, the Government will calculate a weighted evaluated price by multiplying the proposed unit prices for the 8 shoe styles found on the second tab of the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet titled Pricing Matrix, by their respected weights, and summing their totals.  The weight associated with each unit price, represents the likelihood among the most 8 prevalent shoe styles purchased, that an order, if placed, would be placed for that shoe style at the quoted unit price.    <br>        <br>    5. A Total Evaluated Price will be determined by summing the weighted evaluated prices for the 8 shoe styles found on the second tab of the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet titled Pricing Matrix for the base year and each evaluated option year.    <br>        <br>    6. Price Analysis shall be used to determine price reasonableness.  Additional analysis techniques may be used as determined necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer.  These methods of evaluation may include the use of information/input from sources such as (but not limited to) other Government agencies and personnel.    <br>        <br>    7. As part of the evaluation, proposals may be reviewed to identify any significant unbalanced pricing found between the base year and evaluated option years.  In accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), i.e., Unbalanced Pricing, a proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.    <br>        <br>    CLAUSES:    <br>        <br>    See Attachment 0002 - Contract Clauses for the clauses which are applicable to this solicitation.    <br>        <br>    QUOTE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:    <br>        <br>    Offerors shall submit quotes by completing Attachment 0003 - Price Evaluation Spreadsheet.      <br>        <br>    In the event an offeror is not registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), the offeror shall fill-in and return FAR Clause 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items located in Attachment 0002 - Contract Clauses.

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a federal agency with overseas programming, USAID staff can be the target of foreign intelligence services, building theft and unlawful entry, cyber-attack of sensitive and classified information, and other emergency situations. Effective barriers, both physical and psychological, can reduce the likelihood of these threats and better protect OTI employees and systems in Washington. The Safety and Security Operations Assistant will help to pinpoint high-risk areas of the office where potential problems or emergency situations might occur. The incumbent's primary responsibility is to assist in establishing and maintaining a safe work environment for OTI employees in Washington through an office-wide assessment of security needs, and helping to coordinate and implement administrative systems, guidelines, and trainings to minimize and mitigate risk.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>ANS: F-16 Office has access to the source drawings (Distribution D -for DoD and US DoD contractors only) but does not have access to detailed drawings which are proprietary.</p>
<p>Sources Sought Synopsis</p>
<p>F-16 Program Office<br />Fighter/Bomber Directorate<br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center<br />Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</p>
<p>1. Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Fighter/Bomber Directorate (WW), F-16 Program Contracting Office (WWMK), Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking information on a sustainment upgrade or replacement for the current United States Air Force (USAF) F-16 Blocks 40/42/50/52 Programmable Display Generator (PDG).</p>
<p>1.2 Specifically, the F-16 program office is requesting information on a PDG sustainment upgrade or replacement that can be retrofitted onto the existing USAF F-16 Blocks 40/42/50/52 aircraft without exceeding the current Size Weight and Power Cooling (SWaPC) capabilities. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this potential work is 334511: Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, size standard 750 employees.</p>
<p>2. This Is A Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) Only</p>
<p>2.1 This SSS is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This SSS does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.</p>
<p>2.2 The Air Force is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this SSS. All costs associated with responding to this SSS will be solely at the interested parties' expense.</p>
<p>2.3 Responders shall describe how they meet the requirements listed under the Requirements Description and must fully answer the Contractor Capability Survey portions - Part 1 and Part 2.</p>
<p>2.4 Contractors must be either U.S.-owned or a U.S.-owned subsidiary with valid security infrastructure and clearances to accomplish this effort. Large businesses are encouraged to indicate the extent to which they intend to use small businesses.</p>
<p>2.5 The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>3. If there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a response as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>4. Note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentages.</p>
<p>5. If a company is capable of some, but not all of the consolidated requirements stated in this SSS, please provide a response that explains the requirements for which you are capable.</p>
<p>6. Not responding to this SSS does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website. It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>7. Background</p>
<p>7.1 The PDG provides the ability to drive the displays on the F-16. The Government is investigating the possibility of initiating a USAF F-16 PDG sustainment upgrade or replacement program. The objective would be to develop, produce, and field an upgraded PDG system to address operational requirements and supportability issues, with development beginning in 2015 and production beginning in 2019.</p>
<p>7.2 F-16 combat capabilities have expanded to reach the video processing limits of the current PDG. This PDG upgrade supports future Operational Flight Program (OFP) software sustainment upgrades and will support displaying critical operational information. The current PDG cannot handle the volume of operational information in dynamic mission environments. As a result, it is unable to drive modern cockpit displays or support high definition video; due to memory, throughput, and interface limitations, displays routinely blank critical operational information during high track/data density mission scenarios. Critical components of the PDG are suffering Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, including memory components. Upgraded PDG is required to address the digital display/video processing limitations and support modern high definition displays with sufficient memory and throughput to provide properly functioning displays through the entire dynamic envelope of the aircraft to support future operational capabilities.</p>
<p>7.3 Due to security access, system attributes, and concept of operations, foreign contractor participation is not permitted at the prime contractor level. United States contractors must develop the PDG in the United States of America.</p>
<p>7.4 The planned production is estimated to be 700 PDGs, including spares and trainers.</p>
<p>8. Security requirements will be in accordance with the F-16 Security Classification Guide (SCG) and any other applicable classification guides. Please contact F-16 Program Office if you require a copy of the SCG.</p>
<p>9. Industry Discussions: AFLCMC/WWM representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential respondents. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>10. On the following pages is a description of the PDG upgrade requirements and a Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your company's capability.<br />11. If, after reviewing this information, you desire to respond to the SSS, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability to meet these requirements. Companies may be contacted for further information or clarification; however, failure to provide documentation may result in the U.S. Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how your company would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.). Documentation should be provided in the form of a white paper.</p>
<p>12. Questions related to this market survey should be addressed to the Program Manager, John Weyrick, at 937-713-6515 or the Contracting Officer, Christopher Hampton, at 937-713-6996. Questions regarding classified communications shall be addressed by the Security Officer, Ms. Rachel Garcia at (unclassified) 937-904-7735, for directions to a classified phone line.</p>
<p>13. Please include two complete hard copies of the response, no longer than 25 pages each, along with one softcopy on compact disk-read only. In addition, please send one copy by e-mail no later than close of business 30 calendar days after posting date, to the Contracting Officer, Christopher Hampton, at christophe.hampton@us.af.mil, and to the Contracts Negotiator, Christopher Rittenhouse, at christopher.rittenhouse@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>13.1 AFLCMC / WWMK<br />Attn: Christopher Hampton <br />2725 C Street Bldg. 553<br />Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433</p>

<ARCHDATE>10212015
<CONTACT>Kristen Kachur, 973-724-3217

<a href="mailto:kristen.kachur@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of The Department of Defense (DOD) is releasing this special notice to inform interested parties of an interest in establishing a Section 845 Other Transaction (OTA) agreement with an eligible entity or group of entities to develop and mature technologies and support policy development to enable advanced approaches to electromagnetic spectrum use. This initiative will support possible needs across the government and industry, in alignment with the National Information Technology R&D (NITRD)/Wireless Spectrum R&D (WSRD) Senior Steering Group (SSG) mission to promote collaboration among government, industry and academia.   The purpose of this effort is to identify areas of Research & Development/Prototyping (R&D/PROTOTYPING) of vital importance to the Department's ability to maintain access to the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS).  The Government is seeking to facilitate optimal application of SRF funds in developing technologies that enable both spectrum sharing and more efficient spectrum use.     <br>      <br>   Section 845(a) (2) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law (P.L.) 103-160, as amended (Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 2371 note), authorizes the Secretary of the Army (SA) to carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems. The Government must ensure that, when an agency enters into an Other Transaction Agreement for a prototype project under this authority, nontraditional defense contractor(s) participate to a significant extent in the prototype project; or at least one third of the total cost of the prototype project is paid out of funds provided by parties to the transaction other than the Federal Government.    <br>      <br>   Currently, the Government and industry share a common challenge of satisfying vastly increasing demand for the use of electromagnetic spectrum(s). Multiple efforts are addressing this fundamental issue as it hampers U.S. innovation and economic growth and hinders U.S. military operations both domestically and overseas.    <br>      <br>   The envisioned collaboration between the Government and Industry focuses on (but is not limited to) the following Science and Technology areas for consideration:    <br>      <br>   1.	Investments in Radar-Commercial communications sharing technologies, targeted initially to the 3.5 GHz and 5 GHz bands.  Rationale:  the Department is currently in discussions with both Industry and federal regulators to explore options for sharing portions of these bands with commercial wireless providers.  There is also international interest in sharing these regions of the EMS.  Investments in these technologies will enable the Department to maintain mission effectiveness and operational readiness while supporting our own, and the Nation's, strategic goal of spectrum sharing.   <br>      <br>   2.	Investment in use of Millimeter Wave (MMW) and Free-Space Optical (FSO) technologies for terrestrial and air-ground communications and C2/telemetry applications.  Rationale:  the Department's use of spectrum below 6 GHz for terrestrial and air-ground communications is vital to mission effectiveness; demand for these services is increasing and geographical availability of these spectral regions is static or declining, making sharing with commercial service providers difficult.  This problem is compounded in the case of air-ground communications and C2, where large exclusion zones have been encountered in the AWS-3 auction proceedings due to the nature of the airborne applications.   Investments in MMW and FSO technologies will enable the Department to strategically explore these spectral regions and transition terrestrial and air-ground services into these less congested areas.    <br>      <br>   3.	Development and deployment of the Air/Maritime Training Instrumentation (AMTI) waveform.  Rationale:  The AWS-3 auction proceedings enables commercial access to the lower portion (1755-1780 MHz) while DoD will have access to the upper portion (1780-1850 MHz) indefinitely.  Though this provides commercial access to only a small amount of spectrum, the economic and political situation at the time made this an acceptable solution.  Underlying this solution is the general understanding that industry will be seeking access to the upper portion in the near future.  One of the concepts that has been investigated is modifying the ACTS system to use a much more efficient waveform, the AMTI; using the AMTI will better position the Department to open up additional spectrum access, on a shared basis, with commercial service providers.    <br>      <br>   4.	Investments in Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Frequency Reuse (FR) technologies for communications and radar systems.  Rationale:  As sharing becomes more prevalent, systems will need to adjust dynamically to their current electromagnetic environment (EME) automatically and considering their geospatial and temporal location.  Investments in this area will enable the Department to consider more dynamic sharing scenarios and mechanism and improve reliability and mission effectiveness in spectrally-constrained environments.    <br>      <br>   5.	Investments in algorithms and approaches for improving spectrum situational awareness (SA), spectrum command & control (C2), and management of the electromagnetic environment.  Rationale:  As the Department moves towards sharing, with itself and with commercial service providers, while maintaining our ability to project power globally, it will be vital to improve our ability to maintain positive control of the spectrum resource and solid situation awareness of the spectrum  quote mark terrain quote mark , both from a friendly force and enemy force perspective.  This investment will develop technologies and techniques that can be deployed into land, air, sea, and cyber domain capabilities to achieve spectrum SA and C2 under the auspices of the Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (JEMSO) doctrine.   <br>      <br>   6.	Investments in improvements for modeling and simulation of the Electromagnetic Environment (EME).  Rationale:  Emerging results from the DoD EMS Strategy Roadmap and Near-Term Action plan indicate that the Department must improve our ability to model and simulate the EME, to include assessing sharing approaches and techniques, and addressing attending interference and propagation effects.     <br>      <br>   7.	Investments in Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) and other communication and radar waveform efficiency technologies.  Rationale:  As more regions of the spectrum become open to sharing, the Department will need to be more efficient with our available spectrum access.   Investments now in basic and applied R&D/PROTOTYPING will yield useable technologies for programs in a few years at a time when spectrum sharing will be implemented on a wide scale.   <br>      <br>   8.	Interference tolerance and hardening technologies for communications and radar system.  Rationale:  As the department transforms to a share-first model, it will become increasing important for new communications and radar systems to be tolerant of interference that characterizes sharing environments.  Department R&D/PROTOTYPING investments now will create technologies mature enough to be implemented in programs later when spectrum sharing becomes more widespread, both nationally and internationally.   <br>      <br>   9.	Investments in adaptive RF technologies.  Rationale:  In Quadrennial Defense Review 2014, the Department recognized that the EMS, along with international waters and airspace and the cyber domain were vital to the Military's ability to project the force internationally.  As spectrum sharing increases both domestically and internationally, the Department will face additional barriers to spectrum access as it deploys into regions of the globe that either do not support sharing arrangements in particular bands or deny use of those bands.  It is prudent for the Department to invest in technologies now that will enable communications and radar systems to be able to change the spectrum regions in which they operate in response to either enemy action or the exercise of nation-state sovereign rights.   <br>      <br>   It is anticipated that industry members may propose forming a consortium that would seek to work with the Government through an OTA in this area. DOD and NITRD/WSRD recognize that both Government and industry can benefit from an OTA  with a consortium, in order to achieve more rapid contracting, acceleration of discovery, unparalleled ability to tailor research, policy consideration concurrent with technological advances, a more focused and synergistic research agenda, and relief from excessive  requirements.  Any company, university, or research organization is eligible to join the consortium.  The Government is seeking interested parties that are willing to join and/or establish a consortium with collective expertise in the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS).   <br>      <br>   The Government anticipates responses from this announcement from interested parties, with an eligible entity or group of entities, to include industry, academic, non-profit, and not-for-profit partners, for research and development efforts to support the NITRD/WSRD.  Interested parties shall provide a response no later than 4:00 PM EST on 15 November 2014 by email only.  Responses can be sent to Ms. Kristen Kachur, Contract Specialist, via email at kristen.e.kachur.civ@mail.mil.  NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Responses should contain the interested parties' experience and capability information.  In addition, if any existing consortium wishes to respond as an entity, the response shall include consortium name, vision, mission statement, goals, membership (indicating traditional and nontraditional defense contractors), success criteria, metrics, management framework, articles of collaboration/by-laws, Consortium Member Agreement (CMA), accounting practices, fee structure, and other information which the respondent considers of assistance in developing successful Government/academia/industrial partnerships. In addition, the interested parties shall provide specific experience in technology areas listed in this notice along with a description of their capabilities for the categories under which they have experience.   <br>      <br>   Electronic responses are to be in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word format using a size 12 font with one inch margins.  Adobe PDF format is preferred.  Responses should include a cover letter and at a minimum, provide the following:   <br>      <br>   1.	A cover letter    <br>   2.

<DESC>In 2012, the Army conducted an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the Army Contract Writing System (ACWS).  One portion of that AoA was a self-certification relative to the Army requirements.  Each requirement was identified as either: <br>  <br> A = Functionality is available out of the box <br> B = Functionality is available with software Configuration <br> C = Functionality is available with software Customization <br> D = Functionality is available with a 3rd party tool or plug-in tool <br> E = Functionality is available with Integration <br>  <br> The Army has a need to update that 2012 self-certification. Please find the Excel file attached to this RFI.  The first tab contains the initial 737 ACWS 2012 requirements while the second tab contains projected interface requirements.  These are not the exact 1567 requirements that were issued with the Draft RFP on 08AUG2014, nor will they be the exact 1567 requirements issued with the final RFP.  This is merely to be used as a Market Research tool for the Army as we prepare for release of the final RFP.  At present, we need industry to provide the following: <br>  <br> 1. In the first tab of the Excel file, please identify each row as either A, B, C, D, or E and indicate your  quote mark current quote mark  requirement availability (columns C-G) and complexity level (column L).   <br>  <br> 2. In the second tab of the Excel file is a list of all the planned Army interface requirements for ACWS.  The Army encourages you to comment on any area or possible methods for increased efficiency or cost savings (exists out of the box, existing client production implementation that could be leveraged, alternate means of obtaining data, etc.). Please provide an estimated complexity level (column E, F, and G) and return the spreadsheet to the U.S. Government point(s) of contact no later than 5 PM Central Time on 28OCT2014. <br>  <br> If your company had previously provided a self-certification in 2012 to the 737 ACWS requirements, this will be an  quote mark update quote mark  to that self-certification. <br>  <br> If your company had not previously self-certified, please provide your best estimate by the due date.  This is additional Market Research and any response or non-response will NOT have any bearing on any source selection that may/may not result from the ACWS efforts. <br>  <br> This information is considered Market Research and is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Army for any purpose.  This correspondence does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and no contract will be awarded from this request.  Information will not be used in any source selection.

<DESC>&nbsp; This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain capability statements, regarding: <br /><br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; <br /><br />(2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and <br /><br />(3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition (339112 -- Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing). Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code (339112 -- Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing) should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice has been posted to establish, provide, and maintain a laboratory animal personnel protective equipment (PPE) resource to ensure the accessibility and availability of essential supplies throughout an emergency/disaster, government shutdown, or any other interruption of regular deliveries. These supplies support irreplaceable multidisciplinary animal research, which is critical to the mission of eight institutes at the National Institutes of Health. This requirement for supplies of a specific quality and quantity meets specific specifications.<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The Contract will consist of a base year with four (4) option years. In addition to establishing and maintaining PPE as an emergency and disaster resource, the vendor must provide high quality laboratory PPE that meet the specifications as outlined below. Since PPE products have a definitive shelf life, to maintain the integrity of the stocked items the vendor shall deliver requested items from the reserve to the facility on a routine basis or upon request as outlined below. In addition, the vendor shall reestablish the reserve as directed by the Government on a monthly basis. It is the vendor's responsibility to manage the reserve to ensure the continued rotation of product to protect the integrity of the resource.</p>
<p>Project requirements:</p>
<p>Therefore, the vendor must be able to supply the following goods or services:</p>
<p>1. Provide PPE products identical or equivalent to Life Science SMS Lab Coats, Polypropylene Coveralls, SMS Coveralls, Suntech Microporous Film Coveralls, the Non-Skid/Water Resistant shoe covers, Guardian Nitrile Gloves, and Rhino Shield Latex Medical Grade Gloves. PPE items may be added, subtracted, or otherwise modified at the discretion of the Government to meet evolving program requirements;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Ensure that the lab coats and coveralls meet the sizing specifications, salient characteristics and physical properties as outline below;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Ensure that the gloves meet the salient characteristic as outline below;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Provide a specialized temperature, humidity, and vermin controlled storage/warehouse, as outlined below;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Provide routine deliveries to our research facility. Deliveries will be made Monday through Friday from 7:30 AM to 3:00 PM (excluding Federal Holidays);</p>
<p>6. Provide emergency deliveries and services in the event of an emergency or disaster;</p>
<p>7. Ensure that the integrity of the products is maintained throughout storage and delivery. This includes, but is not limited to, protection from moisture and dust which may carry unwanted pathogens;</p>
<p>8. Ensure that less than five percent (&lt;5%) of boxes/items are torn, ripped, or damaged upon delivery; to include faulty zippers within the coveralls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Provide a credit/replacement, at the contractor's expense, for all broken, torn, ripped, or damaged PPE items;</p>
<p>10. Provide return trips to correct an incorrect product delivery/order or replace damaged items within 24 hours of the original required delivery date and time;&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Unload pallets from the delivery truck and place them on the designated animal facility loading dock;</p>
<p>12. Maintain current and accurate product inventory details and controls to ensure the rotation of stock, timely dating, and delivery;</p>
<p>13. Supply a copy of the current inventory, including inventory numbers of each product by manufacturer and production dates, to the COTR on a monthly basis, at the end of each month, or upon request;</p>
<p>14. Provide an Operations Statement which includes the vendors program for maintaining the integrity of the stored and delivered products, as well as product rotation and inventory programs; and</p>
<p>15. Provide a Disaster Plan to include how the contractor shall ensure the provision of services and transportation of required supplies in the event of an emergency or disaster.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance:</p>
<p>To Be Determined</p>
<br />
<p>Other important considerations:</p>
<p><br />1. Coupled with the potential for prolonged manufacturing times and a definitive product shelf life, underscores the critical need for this contract. It is the goal of this contract to establish a stable, cost effective, mechanism to ensure the immediate accessibility of up to a ninety (90) day supply of material, as well as provide for the availability of material for rotation and replacement throughout the twelve (12) month contract period. The initial emergency/disaster reserve volume of all PPE will be determined at the time of award. The reserve volume for each category and product will be subsequently adjusted on a monthly basis in accordance with available resources and program requirements.</p>
<p>2. The Building 49 Central Animal Facility (CAF) located on the Bethesda campus of the National Institutes of Health contributes to the advancement of biomedical research by providing professional and technical support services related to laboratory animal care and use, and housing laboratory animals in support of eight institute's intramural research program. In order to support our animals and the critical research programs they represent, we must ensure consistent supply PPE materials, even during emergency and disaster situations. Due to the critical nature of these supplies our program requirements have been incorporated into both our Facility and Institute disaster preparedness plans.</p>
<p>3. The value of disaster preparedness to laboratory animal facilities has been highlighted in recent years, because of several large scale disasters that have impacted the U.S. research investment. Disaster preparedness in the workplace seeks to reduce direct and indirect losses resulting from disasters. Losses are smallest when the disruptions to animal care and research are minimized. During emergency/disaster events, the normal supply and distribution channels will most likely be unavailable/or protracted due to the impact of the emergency and the rush of immediate orders. Our program's disaster plan takes these factors into account; it is therefore our intention is to establish an offsite source of critical supplies with an established, laboratory animal PPE vendor with a proven track record of providing quality products and services. As outlined in our emergency plan it is the intention of our program to be able to house up to a one year's supply of PPE products with a local vendor within a 90 mile radius of NIH in Bethesda, Maryland. The ideal vendor will need a strong disaster plan and have arrangements made with the state and federal agencies in the event of an emergency and or disaster to be able to arranged deliveries to the NIH. As a secondary backup, in the event that the vendor is not able to transport the required supplies we will work with the local vendor to directly pick up the required items.</p>
<p>4. The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition) defines animal biosecurity as "all measures taken to identify, contain, prevent and eradicate known or unknown infections that may cause clinical disease or alter physiologic and behavioral responses or otherwise make the animals unsuitable for research". The National Animal Health Emergency Management System Guidelines define biosecurity for animal production facilities similarly as "a series of management practices designed to prevent the introduction of and spread of disease agents." Therefore, as part of our program's "Biosecurity Program" we must ensure the provision of an uninterrupted supply of essential supplies, this plan is a shared responsibility between our program and the selected vendor to ensure the consistent availability of high quality PPE products and services.</p>
<p>5. The Vendor's warehouse is required to have adequate, vermin free, space available for the storage of up to a year's supply of PPE. The supplies will be stored in an area that is protected from the risk of contamination from animal pathogens, toxic and or hazardous substances. Ideally, the product shall also be protected from dust which may carry or harbor pathogens. The warehouse shall have a pest control program designed to prevent, control or eliminate the presence of or infestation by pests. The Vendor must provide the name of the firm that provides vermin and pest control services as well as a description of their pest control program. A regularly scheduled and documented program of control and monitoring should exist. The Vendor also must provide documentation with regard to their quality assurance practices. All products supplied should be free of chemical or pathologic contaminants and the presence of natural toxicants. Areas used for storage should not be subject to elevated temperatures or elevated relative humidity for prolonged periods of time as outlined below. The Vendor must provide information on manufacturing, monitoring, and storage of PPE products, as well as quality assurance results on a monthly basis. As part of our programs' responsibility, we will inspect the site(s) annually to ensure that they are meeting the above requirements.</p>
<p>6. It is our intent to incorporate within the contract the ability to secure space within the suppliers' warehouse(s) that meets the biosecurity requirements listed above. As part of the agreement, we would meet with the vendor prior to award and once a year thereafter for a site visit of the warehouse to ensure that the stated requirements outlined in this statement of work are met or exceeded. This will ensure that the facility is able to maintain up to a year's reserve of PPE products at the respective location, as well as the vendor's ability to meet or exceed the requirement of this SOW. This vendor would be required to provide a detailed inventory list on a monthly basis, or more often if needed, and document that the reserve stock is being rotated to ensure the integrity of all products.</p>
<p>7. All PPE clothing and equipment should be of safe design and construction, and should be maintained in a clean and reliable fashion. The Government has taken the usability and fit of the proposed PPE into consideration with the specifications outlined in this RFP. The specifications are based on the requirements that the PPE fits well and is comfortable to wear. This encourages both our staff and researchers to use the PPE. The PPE specifications are available in multiple sizes and care should be taken to ensure that they meet the specifications so that the proper size for each employee is met. It is not uncommon for several different types of PPE to be worn together; the specifications found within the RFP ensure the compatibility of the different PPE. If PPE does not fit properly, it can make the difference between being safely covered or dangerously exposed. Ill-fitting PPE will fail to provide the required level of protection for the staff and the animals, as well as discouraging appropriate use.</p>
<p>8. The distinction between exam gloves proposed within the RFP and general purpose gloves needs to be clarified. Exam grade gloves are different from general purpose gloves in that they must meet a series of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in order to be marketed as exam grade gloves and are acceptable for use by doctors, dentists, labs or any other application requiring a specific barrier to blood or infectious agents. Exam gloves are regulated by stringent FDA requirements requiring specific production and quality control standards. General purpose gloves are for use in food service, industrial or any other application that does not require a specific barrier to blood or infectious agents. This is the most common glove found in the marketplace and popular uses include food service, packaging, automotive, painting and health &amp; beauty. For this RFP only Medical-Grade gloves will be used and must meet the FDA Acceptable Quality level. This is a quality specification that manufacturers, as well as the FDA use to specify the pinhole rate in medical examination gloves. FDA standards specify an AQL of 2.5 for the medical examination gloves. This means that the defect level from a large number of gloves will not exceed 2.5%. The tensile strength of a glove is the measurement of the amount of force or pull required to break any glove. The length and thickness (Mil) is defined within the salient characteristic of each glove listed in the RFP.</p>
<p>9. Samples of each item will be specifically requested as part of any future proposal. Samples are to be furnished free of charge. Samples can be returned at an prospective vendor's request, provided that the vendor pay for the transportation costs.</p>
<p>Standards:<br />&bull; National Research Council (2011). Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition. Pages 21, 22, 141. Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission on Life Sciences</p>
<p><br />&bull; National Institute of Health, Animal Research Advisory Committee Guidelines for Personnel Protection in Animal Facilities</p>
<p><br />&bull; OSHA requires that many categories of PPE meet or be equivalent to standards developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The proposed PPE must meet the cited ANSI standard. PPE stocks must meet the ANSI standard in effect at the time of its manufacture or provide protection equivalent to PPE manufactured to the ANSI criteria. OSHA requires PPE to meet the following ANSI standards:</p>
<p>o Eye and Face Protection: ANSI Z87.1-1989 (USA Standard for Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection).<br />o Head Protection: ANSI Z89.1-1986.<br />o Foot Protection: ANSI Z41.1-1991.<br />o For hand protection, there is no ANSI standard for gloves but OSHA recommends that selection be based upon the tasks to be performed and the performance and construction characteristics of the glove material. For protection against chemicals, glove selection must be based on the chemicals encountered, the chemical resistance and the physical properties of the glove material.</p>

N62470-14-R-6024: MARKET RESEARCH/ REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION/PRODUCTION TO SUPPLY LOCATIONS IN ROTA, SPAIN.

NAVFAC EURAFSWA is performing research to determine whether renewable electric power generation opportunities in off base locations are available to transmit power across the existing local grid to Naval Station Rota.
  NAVFAC EURAFSWA is particularly interested in renewable energy systems that have been newly constructed. Power purchase costs would need to be within normal market prices (rates) for the duration of the contract. NAVFAC EURAFSWA seeks to identify responsible sources and obtain information regarding opportunities and risks associated with renewable energy production.  The results of this Sources Sought/Request for Information (SS/RFI) will assist in developing a potential RFP that may be issued at a later date.

As permitted by FAR Part 10, NAVFAC EURAFSWA is requesting responses, comments, recommendations and suggestions as Market Research and Request for Information to assist in the development of an acquisition strategy.
 The intent is to identify potential proposers and collect information on any conventional or renewable energy generation that is economically attractive and feasible. NAVFAC EURAFSWA desires to solicit maximum industry participation allowing formulation of a concise acquisition process in a timely manner.

This Request for Information shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does not intend to finance any effort associated with this SS/RFI nor guarantee award of a contract on the basis of this RFI.


Synopsis of Relevant Conditions at Naval Station Rota

Naval Station Rota currently operates with an average electrical load of approximately 6 MW in winter and 12 MW in summer, with a peak load of roughly 12 MW.
 The highest load occurs in the summer months due to the HVAC demand driven by the warm weather conditions.  The response should address electrical integration with the existing power supply e.g. the varying capacity of the potential renewable plant relative to the purchase of brown power to supply the required load.

NAVFAC EURAFSWA will not provide land for this project.  The project is required to be newly constructed, any renewable energy credits would be sold exclusively to the Navy. 

Currently, all electrical power is purchased via competitive procurement. Power is distributed across the site via Navy maintained and operated distribution systems.

The responses should address electrical integration with the existing power supply e.g.
 the varying capacity of the potential renewable plant relative to the purchase of brown power to supply the required load.

<p>Phase I covering preliminary design, R&amp;D and final design is planned to be performed under a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Subcontract (Cost, No-Fee if with an educational institution) during the period 2015 through 2017.</p>
<p>Phase II covering fabrication, testing, and delivery of the components is currently planned to be performed under a Subcontract type not yet defined during the period 2018 through 2021.</p>
<p>Phases I and II deliverables are specified in the SOW.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Expressions of Interest is to determine the availability of qualified parties interested in performing the tasks described in the SOW and to determine the projected cost range for the work. This information will be used for planning and budgetary purposes. No order will be placed at this time against any response received hereunder.</p>
<p>Expression of Interest responses should include a) the identify of team members, a brief description of the major role of each and the member that will lead, if teaming is proposed; brief descriptions of the b) technical approach; c) Relevant previous institutional experience; capabilities and facilities d) key personnel including previous experience on similar projects; e) comments on the reasonableness of the project schedule in Appendix VI of the SOW; and f) and the ITER UP IR Sensors - DAQ - Analysis Software Cost Estimate Sheet for Phases I and II completed in conformance with the guidance in the Spreadsheet "Instructions" tab. (The Phase II estimate should include labor required to write and validate the software and to test the complete sensor/data acquisition system but not include the cost of the visible and IR sensors, associated electronics and the fast processors).</p>
<p>A copy of the Statement of Work and the ITER UP IR Sensors - DAQ - Analysis Software Cost Estimate Sheet for Phases I and II may be found at http://procurement.pppl.gov/Procurement%20Opportunities.HTM. Interested organizations should respond with a complete EOI package no later than 5:00 PM (EDT) on&nbsp;21 &nbsp;November 2014. If you cannot get access to the EOI package on the Procurement Opportunities website contact Larry Sutton (<a href="mailto:lsutton@pppl.gov">lsutton@pppl.gov</a>) and a copy of the package will be e-mailed to you.&nbsp; Responses, and any questions regarding this request for Expressions of Interest&nbsp;should also&nbsp;be directed to Larry Sutton.</p>

<DESC>Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)<br />Indian Health Services<br />Sources Sought<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is ONLY to invite qualified socio-economic firms to submit capability statements demonstrating the ability to provide the services listed below. &nbsp;To be included in the capability statement, firms shall include information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />
<p>Background<br />Federal government agencies, in conjunction with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), have the responsibility to prohibit discrimination within the civil service on the basis of race, color, religion or religious accommodation, sex, national origin, age, disability or disability accommodation, genetic information, reprisal for opposition to discrimination or participation in the complaint process, and sexual orientation.<br />Commissioned Corps Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service are not covered under the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws or subject to the provisions of Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) &sect;1614. However, Commissioned Corps Personnel Manual, INSTRUCTION 6, Subchapter CC26.1, "Equal Opportunity: Discrimination Complaints Processing" establishes the rights of Commissioned Corps Officers to be free from discrimination and retaliation.<br />Complaints of EEO discrimination alleged by employees of federal agencies or applicants for federal employment covered by Title 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1614 and any subsequent law, statute, regulation, or directive are included within the scope of this Statement of Work (SOW). Commissioned Corps Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service covered by the Commissioned Corps Personnel Manual, INSTRUCTION 6, Subchapter CC26.1, "Equal Opportunity: Discrimination Complaints Processing" are also included within the scope of this Statement of Work. <br />Objectives</p>
<p>Title 29 CFR Part 1614 requires federal agencies to develop and implement equal employment opportunity programs and complaint processing procedures. EEOC Management Directive EEO MD-110 implements the requirements of 29 CFR Part 1614. Federal agencies perform a portion of the required EEO services in house. This statement of work will outline the roles and responsibilities of each party when the Ordering Agency (Agency) needs to contract out investigative, EEO counseling, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), and drafting Final Agency Decision (FAD) functions.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>Investigations of Formal EEO Complaints<br />The Agency will issue the case assignment to the Contractor. Three types of discrimination complaints may be investigated; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints. Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the investigation is usually performed in four major phases: (a) preparing for the investigation; (b) securing testimony; (c) obtaining documentary evidence and developing statistical information; and (d) preparing the investigative file. The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor. <br />Counseling of EEO Informal Complaints<br />The Agency will issue the case assignment to the Contractor. Three types of discrimination complaints may be counseled; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints. Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the EEO Counseling is usually performed in four major phases: (a) Interviewing the Counselee, Responsible Management Official(s) (RMO), and witnesses; (b) framing the claims and drafting management's and witnesses' responses to the claims; (c) obtaining documentary evidence and statistical information; and (d) preparing the counseling report and related documents. The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor. The Contractor will also use, unless otherwise indicated by the COR, documents and forms provided by the Agency.<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)<br />The Agency will determine when an aggrieved person or complainant is to be referred to the Contractor for ADR services. Three types of discrimination complaints may be referred; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints. Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is usually performed in six major phases: (a) Reviewing the Agency dispute file; (b) Developing an ADR Action Plan; (c) Setting up Meetings/Caucuses between the Parties; (d) Reviewing the ADR process with the Parties; (e) Identifying the issues; and either (f) Assisting the Parties in putting a proposed settlement agreement in writing and develop a draft settlement agreement or notifying the Parties if efforts to settle the dispute have been unsuccessful. The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor. The Contractor will also use, unless otherwise indicated by the COR, documents and forms provided by the Agency.</p>
<p>Drafting a Final Agency Decision <br />The Agency will issue the case assignment to the Contractor. Three types of discrimination complaints may require written FADs; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints. Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the FAD is usually performed in four major phases: (a) reviewing the Report of Investigation (ROI); (b) Drafting a presentation of facts; (c) conducting and drafting a legal analysis of the claims based on the information and evidence in the ROI; and (d) drafting recommended findings, conclusions, and, if applicable, appropriate remedies. The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor. The Contractor will also use, unless otherwise indicated by the COR, documents and forms provided by the Agency.<br />Investigation of Discrimination Complaints and Preparation of Reports of Investigation<br />The purpose of this subsection is to obtain Reports of Investigation in conformance with the standards established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Investigations shall be performed to identify and obtain evidence from all relevant sources and gather sufficient information, relevant to the accepted issues in the complaint, to determine the validity of the allegations. If the Agency determines a violation of the applicable laws occurred, the Report of Investigation must provide the Agency with a sufficient factual basis from which to fashion an appropriate remedy.<br />Investigations shall include a thorough review of the circumstances under which the alleged discrimination occurred and the treatment of others not of the complainant's class in the organizational segment. Additionally, the investigation shall require a review of any policies and practices related to the alleged discrimination. <br />1.1 Agency and Agency Contact Person <br />The Contractor will be provided an Agency Contact Person (ACP) at the Indian Health Service (IHS), Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity Staff (DM &amp; EEO). The ACP is to be determined when the service is ordered and specified on the case assignment by the Agency. The ACP will make the determination of the category of the complaint and the number of issues contained in each complaint. Disagreements between the Agency and the Contractor should be resolved by discussion between the ACP and the Contractor. If a modification to the original case assignment is required as a result of discussions between the ACP and the Contractor, the ACP shall revise the case assignment to reflect the agreed upon category of complaint and/or number of issues, and send the revised case assignment to the Contractor. If disagreements cannot be resolved, the Agency reserves the right to terminate the case assignment.<br />2. EEO Counseling of Discrimination Complaints and Preparation of Counseling Reports<br />2.1 Purpose<br />The purpose of the EEO Counseling inquiry is to obtain information regarding the claim(s), address jurisdictional questions, and attempt to facilitate a resolution to the Counselee's requested remedy. The EEO Counselor should interview persons who can provide information that is relevant to the claim(s), settlement, and jurisdictional questions. The EEO counseling inquiry is not an "investigation" nor is it intended to resolve disputed facts; rather, it is simply gathering information necessary for the EEO Counselor to assist the parties in resolving the matter. The EEO Counselor must control the inquiry at all times and seek guidance and assistance from the Agency. Documents generated through EEO Counseling should adhere to Agency formats, style guide requirements, and unless approved in writing, use Agency-provided forms and materials.<br />2.2 Agency and Agency Contact Person <br />The Contractor will be provided an Agency Contact Person (ACP) at the Indian Health Service (IHS) Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity Staff (DM &amp; EEO). The ACP is to be determined when the service is ordered and specified on the case assignment by the Agency. The ACP will make the determination of the category of the complaint. Disagreements between the Agency and the Contractor should be resolved by discussion between the ACP and the Contractor. If a modification to the original case assignment is required as a result of discussions between the ACP and the Contractor, the ACP shall revise the case assignment to reflect the agreed upon category of complaint, and send the revised case assignment to the Contractor. If disagreements cannot be resolved, the Agency reserves the right to terminate the case assignment.<br />2.3 Requirements of the Contractor<br />To perform EEO counseling, the Contractor shall:<br />Provide to the ACP within 2 business days from receipt of case assignment the name, contact information, and, if not previously provided, documentation of current counseling certification. <br />Furnish all essential equipment, materials, personnel, and supplies necessary to perform all of the work detailed herein, including conducting EEO counseling and preparing the Counselor's Report.<br />The EEO Counselor will immediately notify the ACP in writing providing details sufficient for the ACP to advise Agency leadership if any of the following occurs:<br />Any individual involved in the EEO Counseling process advises that he/she needs a reasonable accommodation or is unable to perform work duties due to a disability.<br />Any individual involved in the EEO counseling process advises that he/she is a threat to himself or others, or words to that effect, or that any other employee or contractor is a threat to self or others or words to that effect.<br />Conduct EEO Counseling via telephonic interviews, unless otherwise impracticable, at which point in-person interviews are permitted with prior written authorization from the COR. Any alternate method for conducting EEO Counseling must be approved in writing and in advance, of the EEO counseling, by the COR.<br />The EEO Counselor shall contact the Counselee within three (3) days of assignment to schedule the Initial interview.<br />The Initial interview with the Counselee should be conducted as soon as possible after receiving assignment, but no later than eight (8) days of assignment. If the Counselee has provided documentation of representation using the Agency-provided form, the EEO Counselor must include the representative in all correspondence, email, telephone conversations, interviews, and any other contact with the Counselee. Unusual circumstances that may prevent conducting the interview immediately; e.g., illness, emergency leave, priority assignments, must be brought to the attention of the ACP.<br />The EEO Counselor should request , within two (2) business days of the initial interview with Counselee, any documents from the ACP and/or the COR that the EEO Counselor believes are relevant to the limited inquiry. <br />The EEO Counselor must request all relevant documentation regarding the matters raised in counseling from the ACP and the Counselee only (all requests for documents, except for requests to the Counselee, must be made to the ACP or COR). <br />The EEO Counselor must instruct the Counselee to submit all requested/offered documents to the ACP and instruct all witnesses to submit any documents they offer in support of their interviews to the ACP EEO Counselor. The EEO Counselor will review the documents and determine they are to be included in the EEO Counselor's Report within three (3) business days of receipt from the Counselee/witnesses. If the EEO Counselor has any questions regarding the inclusion of the submitted documents with the EEO Counselor's Report, then the EEO Counselor shall check with the ACP for guidance on the matter. <br />The EEO Counselor shall interview all witnesses, including the RMO, within twenty (20) days of the Counselee's Initial contact with the Agency. Prior to contacting anyone other than the Counselee, and if applicable, the Counselee's representative, the EEO Counselor must obtain written authorization from the ACP or COR.<br />The Contractor must notify the ACP immediately if a Counselee or witness refuses to cooperate with the limited inquiry. The ACP will take appropriate steps to secure the witness' cooperation and remind the witness of his/her duty to cooperate with the inquiry. If the Counselee and/or witness ultimately fail to cooperate with the EEO Counselor, the EEO Counselor must document all attempts to secure the cooperation of that uncooperative witness or Counselee in the Counseling Report and attach any documentation, such as emails, to the Report. <br />The EEO Counselor must control the inquiry at all times and seek guidance and assistance from the Agency. <br />The EEO Counselor shall write-up each interview after completion, and incorporate the information into the Counselor's Report.<br />The EEO Counselor shall review and summarize all documents relevant to the claim(s) and incorporate the information into the Counselor's Report.<br />If the EEO Counselor believes the inquiry is deficient procedurally, or in content or scope, he/she shall immediately notify the COR.<br />By the 26th day after the Counselee's Initial contact with the Agency, if the EEO Counselor has not completed the counseling process, the EEO Counselor should contact the Counselee regarding obtaining an extension.<br />A Counselee may agree, in writing, to postpone the Final Interview and extend the period for pre-complaint counseling for up to or less than sixty (60) additional calendar days from the date of the Initial contact.<br />Any extension of counseling must be requested by the EEO Counselor to the ACP and/or COR prior to the expiration of the initial thirty (30) day period.<br />Because timely completion of Pre-complaint counseling increases the probability of informal resolution and minimizes the negative impact that protracted inquiries have on the work environment, requests for extensions of EEO Counseling should be requested from the COR and/or ACP only in the following instances:</p>
<p>With the written consent of the Counselee; or<br />Requested by the Counselee; or<br />Unusual circumstances which prevented completion of the counseling inquiry during the initial thirty (30) day period, i.e., illness, travel, or emergency leave of the Counselee, a primary witness; or<br />When the Agency believes that informal resolution is likely or imminent, and a short additional counseling period is necessary to consummate an agreement.</p>
<p>The EEO Counselor should attempt to facilitate a resolution of the pre-complaint. If the Counselee and the Agency agree to an informal resolution of the dispute during the course of the EEO counseling inquiry, the terms of the informal resolution should be reduced to writing, and provided to the ACP or COR, and sent to the EEO Office for final review and approval by the EEO Office for form and compliance purposes. The EEO Counselor may not provide said document to anyone other than the ACP or COR.</p>
<p>If the Counselee elects to withdraw the Pre-complaint, the withdrawal must be obtained in writing using Agency-provided forms.</p>
<p>The EEO Counselor is responsible for submitting a final Counselor's Report, regardless of whether the Pre-complaint is withdrawn, settled, resolved, went to ADR or is completed in any other manner, along with all paperwork gathered during the counseling process to the EEO office within three (3) days of conducting the Final Interview, within three (3) days of the conclusion of EEO Counseling, whether by final interview or otherwise, but no later than the 29th day from the Counselor's Initial contact with the Agency, unless the Counselee has authorized an extension using Agency-provided forms. If such an extension was granted, the Counseling materials are due no later than seven (7) days before the end of the extension period.</p>
<p><br />Submit a weekly status report of all open EEO Counseling cases to the COR; or submit a status report of any and all open EEO Counseling cases upon the request of the COR in a format acceptable to the COR.</p>
<p>Perform EEO Counseling and have access to data related to any complaint only after providing a signed Nondisclosure Agreement for all personnel assigned under this Statement of Work.<br />Review all relevant personnel records and statistical data and make copies as needed for inclusion in the Counselor's Report.<br />3. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)</p>
<p>At a minimum, the Contractor shall include the following steps in the ADR process:<br />Review of Agency Dispute File: The Contractor shall review the Agency dispute file to determine the specific action(s) that caused the Aggrieved Person to believe that he/she is a victim of discrimination.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop an ADR Action Plan, including milestone dates. The ADR Action Plan shall be made available to the Agency Contact Person (ACP) in accordance with the timeframes of this Statement of Work (SOW). The ADR Action Plan shall identify the name of the proposed dispute resolution professional and include a copy of the dispute resolution professional's resume detailing his/her ADR experience.</p>
<p>Meetings/Caucuses: The Contractor shall advise the principal parties of the time and place for the ADR meeting(s).

<p>Agreement: If the allegation(s) is resolved and full or partial agreement is reached on the substance of the dispute, the Contractor shall assist the parties in putting the proposed Settlement Agreement in writing and develop a draft Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p>Closure: When it becomes apparent to the Contractor that resolution will not be reached, the Contractor shall inform the parties that their efforts to settle the dispute have been unsuccessful and shall close the ADR process. The Contractor shall maintain confidentiality in the process unless required to by law.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to adhere to the Model Standards of Conduct for Mediators promulgated by the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution, the American Arbitration Association, and the American Bar Association.</p>
<p>The Agency shall:</p>
<p>Determine when an aggrieved person or complainant is to be referred to the Contractor for ADR.<br />1. Obtain written consent agreement from the parties to participate in the ADR process. <br />2. Forward the case to the Contractor. <br />3. Provide private meeting space for the on-site visit and/or authorize other method(s) of ADR to accomplish resolution. <br />4. Provide other accommodation(s)/aid(s) that may be requested by persons with disabilities. <br />5.

<p>The Contractor is required to adhere to the Model Standards of Conduct for Mediators promulgated by the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution, the American Arbitration Association, and the American Bar Association.</p>
<p>1. Confidentiality: All information revealed during the ADR process is confidential. The Contractor shall advise the parties to the resolution attempt of their obligation to resist disclosures of information about the contents and outcomes of the ADR process. The Contractor in connection with the ADR function shall not utilize electronic devices used for recordings or transcripts of ADR proceedings or conferences.</p>
<p>2. Additional Services: Upon request of the Agency, the Contractor and the COR may negotiate terms and conditions for additional ADR services, e.g. neutral evaluations, conciliation, mini-trials, etc. <br />4. Preparation of Final Agency Decisions<br />4.1 Agency and Agency Contact Person <br />The Contractor will be provided an Agency Contact Person (ACP) at the Indian Health Service (IHS) Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity Staff (DM &amp; EEO). The ACP is to be determined when the service is ordered and specified on the case assignment by the Agency. The ACP will make the determination of the category of the complaint. Disagreements between the Agency and the Contractor should be resolved by discussion between the ACP and the Contractor. If a modification to the original case assignment is required as a result of discussions between the ACP and the Contractor, the ACP shall revise the case assignment to reflect the agreed upon category of complaint, and send the revised case assignment to the Contractor. If disagreements cannot be resolved, the Agency reserves the right to terminate the case assignment.<br />4.2 Case Assignment<br />The COR will electronically forward the case assignment; the ACP will, depending on the size of the document files, electronically or via a nationally recognized mail service, forward the Report of Investigation (ROI) and the case file. The Contractor shall assign a FAD Writer to a matter within two (2) business days of receipt of the assignment.<br />4.3 Requirements of the Contractor<br />The Contractor shall prepare FADs and have access to information related to any complaint only after providing a signed Nondisclosure Agreement for all personnel assigned under this Statement of Work.<br />The Contractor shall prepare a FAD which discusses and analyzes all claims presented in the formal complaint(s).

Generally, where compensatory damages are appropriate, an award amount will not be given in the original FAD, unless sufficient information was provided in the ROI to make that determination. Instead, the complainant will be advised that compensatory damages may be available and will be provided with guidance on the procedure used for requesting, proving, and determining compensatory damage awards.</p>
<p>The analysis of each claim must follow established rules, regulations and legal principles and precedents. The FAD must clearly identify which theory of discrimination is being applied, i.e., disparate treatment, hostile work environment harassment, and/or adverse impact.<br />Case law precedents relied on in the FAD will be cited and will be in accordance with the EEOCG Style Guide. Matters from the ROI referenced in the FAD will be accordance with the EEOCG Style Guide and include Exhibit and page number.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification (12) to the Medical Appointment Scheduling System (MASS) FedBizOpps announcement, VA118-14-I-0352, is to provide answers to general questions that have been received.  The questions and answers pertaining to the draft PWS/related documents are being finalized and will be provided at a later date.

General Questions and Answers

1)	Provide an example of utilization of a service model (context: VA previously mentioned that there are potential vendors who may offer a service model vs. product model; question is does VA have any other IT work contracted as a service as opposed to having bought software). 

Response:    
Concur Government Edition (CGE) is a COTS example where VA is paying for a service to use the software (Software as a Service (SAAS)) model.  The Financial Service Center serves as VA's liaison to the servicing provider.  

2)	Provide the guidelines/requirements/timelines that will be on the company that wins the contract to do maintenance on the service/product they provide (i.e. patches or other software updates) 

Response:  The direction to the Contractor will be contained within the contract upon award and within related Task Orders that will be awarded.  

As of this writing, below is notional guidance to prospective offerors, which is an excerpt from the DRAFT PWS that was released on FedBizOpps on 9/17/2014.  (This is subject to change upon release of final solicitation):
  
The Contractor shall operate, repair, and maintain systems, applications, and IT environments in support of MASS and/or system components for production environments.  This includes but is not limited to, preventive maintenance and scheduled maintenance, activities to retain or restore systems (such as testing, measurements, replacements, and adjustments), and other routine work required to maintain and/or enhance IT systems.  Environments requiring O&M tasks may include pre-production, production, test, training, disaster recovery/fail over, hosting, or any other combination of IT accounts.  The Contractor may also be required to provide software, platform, telecommunications and storage as a service through a subscription or other means.  The Contractor may also be required to recommend best practice for requirements analysis, planning, design, deployment and ongoing operations management and technical support.  The Contractor shall also maintain a current and up-to-date library of all operational documentation, logs of operational events, maintenance of operational monitoring and management tools, operational scripts and operational procedures. 

Software maintenance includes all activities starting once an initial capability has been developed through the life cycle of that capability.  Software maintenance includes all adaptive, perfective, and defect maintenance.   Adaptive maintenance activities are those required to adapt software and systems to support changing externally initiated changes in requirements.   Examples could include, but are not limited to, regulatory changes, congressional actions, VA mandates, and changes required to maintain interoperability with key systems (internal or external to the VA).  Perfective maintenance activities are those required to increase deployed software and systems efficiency to improve performance and/or lower cost of operation.  Defect maintenance includes those activities required to identify and repair defective coding or systems post production deployment.

3)	For MASS, provide VA's current Implementation Plan for this software (no brief requested, just the documentation)

Response:  This material is acquisition sensitive and cannot be released at this time.  If this document is released to FedBizOpps as a draft for industry comment, then it will be provided within an updated response to this request.  If not, it will be provided once the information may be made public pursuant to federal acquisition laws and regulations.    

4)	For MASS, provide a detailed description of "core capabilities"   

Response:  This material is acquisition sensitive and cannot be released at this time.  If this document is released to FedBizOpps as a draft for industry comment, then it will be provided within an updated response to this request.  If not, it will be provided once the information may be made public pursuant to federal acquisition laws and regulations.    

5)	Details regarding the 70+ and 40+ input/outputs referenced

Response:  Embedded below are two documents that help explain the complexity of system dependencies related to the scheduling module within VistA.
   

6)	Details regarding the use of a Reference Implementation Model so that vendors can "show" their product meets the necessary standards expected (and as should be identified in the procurement process). 

Response:   Details are contained within the Source Selection Evaluation Plan (SSEP) which is acquisition sensitive.  If this document is released to FedBizOpps as a draft for industry comment, then it will be provided within an updated response to this request.  If not, it will be provided once the information may be made public pursuant to federal acquisition laws and regulations.
