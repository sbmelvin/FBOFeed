Geological Survey, Geologic Division, has a requirement for a database with extensive worldwide coverage that contains organic geochemical data on oil and gas samples from exploratory wells and producing fields.  The database must be in digital form with precise location information such that data can be plotted on maps using Geographic Information System computer software.  The database shall include information on over 4,000 oils and 3,000 gases from exploratory wells and producing fields from around the world.  Access to such database is critical to the identification and mapping of petroleum systems for the World Energy and National Oil and Gas Assessments, and is required by the USGS to provide adequate coverage of geochemical data worldwide.

<CONTACT>TANGEE BROOKIE PURCHASING AGENT 3032369322     tbrookie@usgs.gov;
<DESC>POC:  Tangee Brookie, U. S. Geological Survey, Box 25046, MS-204A, Denver, CO 80225, e-mail:  tbrookie@usgs.gov  The U. S. Geological Survey, National Training Center, Leadership Development Program, has a requirement for evaluating the effectiveness of its program and understand how a leadership-centered culture is diffusing through the organization.  The USGS Strategic Plan sets a goal to foster visionary leadership and outlines an implementation plan to establish a bureau-wide Leadership Development Program and to measure its success.  The Plan focuses on some traditional measurement tools used in evaluation theory; however, organization capabilities and adoption questions that can help the USGS improve the overall leadership program in the future are not fully addressed.  The combination of evaluation and diffusion theory is necessary to provide an outstanding basis for measuring the leadership program's impact and potential in reaching that goal.  The combined power of evaluation theory and diffusion theory are needed to address the role of knowledge, learning, and cultural inculcation to enhance the capabilities of individual people and the organization they inhabit.  A Dillman-style survey design methodology will be used to get before-and-after parallel samples, treatment-and-control comparisons, 360-degree panel studies, and paired samples to investigate the efficacy of mentoring activities.  Working knowledge of the USGS Leadership Development Program and the USGS measurement approach for strategic change issues is required along with knowledge, experience, and published reports applying diffusion theory in social sciences.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Walden Consulting, 843 Burg St., Grantville, OH, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.

ITEM 4. 8 EA. NOVELTEX BILLETS, PARTIALLY DENSIFIED, 4"X2"X1". This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from T.E.A.M. Inc., 147 Industrial Drive, P.O.Box 927, Slatersville, RI 02876-000, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The lack of competition is justified due to their unique capabilities to develop a prototype truss core fiber preform, their ability to meet NASA's aggressive testing schedule and prior history of delivering high quality woven 3-D structures. The ability to weave 3-D SiC fiber structures represents a unique capability in the textile industry. Weaving of the high modulus ceramic fibers requires adaptation of weaving equipment to limit fiber breakage and maintain uniformity of the fiber weave. T.E.A.M., Inc. has both the necessary equipment and experience to produce high quality woven 3-D ceramic fiber preforms. They are able to give NASA's task the highest priority which will allow completion of the woven fiber preforms within 10 weeks which will allow NASA to adhere to an accelerated development program.  They have also displayed the flexibility in design and manufacturing capabilities whch are necessary to adapt their unique capabilities to the production of a prototype part such as the one requested by NASA. The Government intends to acquire commercial items using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 13, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Interested HBCUs and MIs should  provide the contracting office as early as possible, but not later than  15 days after this notice, evidence of their capability to perform the  contract, and a positive statement of their eligibility as an HBCU or MI. If adequate response is not received from HBCUs and MIs, the solicitation  will instead be issued, without further notice, as: unrestricted. Therefore,  replies to this notice are also requested from all interested parties.  The solicitation, once released will clearly indicate if the action is set-aside  for HBCU/MI or unrestricted.  The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments  Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, 07806-5000, will be seeking qualified Bidders with the capability to conduct research to better address corrosion issues  for the U.S. Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO). It is  assembling a Pacific Rim Corrosion Research Program (PRCRP) whose mission is three fold:  First, to study corrosion effects on several materials such as  metal-matrix composites, ceramic film coatings and Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS).  Secondly is to study them in climates found in the PTO  such as temperate, frozen alpine, rain forest, and desert as well as  marine and volcanic environments. Third, is to correlate the data found  in the laboratory tests to tests made in the actual climate conditions  found in the PTO.  Specific details include corrosion mapping of unique climates and in addition, identification of corrosion mechanisms, methods  of corrosion protection and inhibition and the development of corrosion  test protocols relevant to the PTO will be conducted.  The research will  entail laboratory corrosion studies, field studies in the natural  environments, and the correlation between the laboratory and field studies.

OBJECTIVE: Purchase a shredder system that  is capable of shredding rolled (sheeted) cotton linters to a specific geometry  to support the manufacture of Nitrocellulose at Radford Army Ammunition Plant  (AAP). BACKGROUND: Sheeted cotton linters are currently shredded using a  conventional shear shredding system.  The shredded material is of irregular  shapes with frayed edges, and the shredding operation generates a significant  amount of dust and fines.  The resultant shredded product is difficult to  efficiently nitrate impacting the nitrocellulose manufacturing process. A new  shredder system is required that is able to produce cotton slivers to a  specific, controlled geometry with sharp, defined edges and minimal generation  of dust and fines.  BID DOCUMENTATION: When submitting bids, the following  supporting documentation, either in drawing form or as separate data, is  required: (1) Assembly and Subassembly:  Assembly and subassembly drawings  sufficient to fully describe, in principle and detail, the operation of and  the installation requirements of the proposed equipment.

<DESC>SUBJECT: ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLE PROGRAM IN DELHI, INDIA DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy"s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA  site intends to award a fixed priced purchase order West Virginia University and The National Alernative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC) to purchase the following: STATEMENT OF WORK Based on information included in Attachment 2, Background, the NAFTC proposes a multiple-step approach to help the Delhi government, industry and others implement natural gas vehicles through awareness and technical training. The NAFTC will work with the US DOE Clean Cities program and the Clean Cities model to assist with meeting the public outreach needs for Delhi government officials, Delhi Transport Corporation, bureaucrats and others and meet the AFV training needs of the people and industry (like the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) of Delhi, India.  This approach will allow for development of a more successful program. Tasks will involve NAFTC members traveling to Delhi, India for the following: Determine General Needs in the Area of AFV Training, Conduct AFV Orientation Workshop, and Provide Technical Assistance and training and Assist with the Validation of Training in Delhi and other AFV training or presentations deemed appropriate by the NAFTC and US DOE on light-duty and medium/heavy-duty vehicles.   The NAFTC is especially suited to provide the training required due to the successful programs it has implemented in the US and it's knowledge of the Indian AFV situation obtained on the previous trip by the Executive Director.   The training will involve areas of natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vehicle operation, equipment, safety and repair and compressed natural gas (CNG) cylinder inspection and training.  Training will be weighted heavily on conversion technology. The NAFTC proposes to conduct the following process in providing AFV training in Delhi, India:   1) Determine General Needs in Area of AFV Training  Project participants will visit with key Indians involved with the alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) industry in Delhi.  These individuals and organizations will be identified based on previous visits to Delhi by NAFTC, US EPA and US DOE representatives and by US DOE team members working on similar Delhi projects.  Meetings will be scheduled with these groups initially to discuss training and project objectives.  Prior to these meetings, the following will be identified and utilized by NAFTC participants and/or other US DOE team members:   a. Key organizers of AFVs in Delhi   b. Key partners in Delhi   c. Key automotive trainers in Delhi   d. Available training facilities/equipment in Delhi   e. Technician training needs in Delhi   f. Technician technical skills in Delhi   g. Vehicles in operation in Delhi (medium/heavy-duty and light-duty)   h. Conversion kits, tanks, and equipment being utilized in Delhi   i. Available infrastructure in Delhi, including maintenance facilities and equipment   j. Training materials in use in Delhi, if any   k. Possible International Training Center Partnership of NAFTC in Delhi  Information from these meetings will be used to determine the training materials needed during the conduct of training in India.  In addition, information for the conduct of the AFV Overview Workshop will be determined during these meetings.  The following items must be identified during these meetings, so that existing NAFTC materials, presentations, etc. can be utilized:   a.  Curricula needs   b.  Training materials needs   c.  Training aids needs   d.  Training materials that can be utilized or modified from the NAFTC   e.  Suggested training agendas  *NOTE:  It is suggested that US DOE (and possibly US EPA) participate in determining the AFV training needs for Delhi, India.   2) Conduct AFV Orientation Workshop  A general overview workshop on alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) will be developed and adapted from the existing NAFTC AFV Overview Workshop materials. This workshop will be developed based on the identified AFV training needs. The workshop will be developed for AFVs in general with a heavy concentration on compressed natural gas (CNG) for light-duty vehicles and medium-to-heavy-duty vehicles.  In addition, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG or propane) will be discussed. This AFV/CNG workshop will include an overview of the alternative fuels the US DOE suggests the NAFTC to cover, current Delhi legislation (as provided and researched by US DOE team members and the NAFTC with Indian officials and industry representatives), glossary of AFV terms, and AFV contacts (websites and other appropriate available information).   The workshop will be 4 to 8 hours in length.  The NAFTC will work with the US DOE and Indian host partners to determine location, time and cost (if any) of the workshop.  The NAFTC will also work with the US DOE and other Indian partners to secure local speakers as needed to present the Delhi AFV situation or other appropriate subjects.  The US DOE and US EPA will also participate as speakers, should they desire.  The workshop will be designed to educate the attendees on the AFV/CNG (and LPG will be discussed) subject at hand, the importance of correct and safe installation guidelines, safety in general, CNG specific conversions and emissions.  The AFV workshop will contain a CNG (and LPG will be discussed) emphasis. The following workshop sections will be included as well as other topics determined by the training needs:   a. Natural Gas Vehicles (NGVs) (and LPG vehicles will be discussed)   b. Driver Orientation   c. NGV Safety   d. CNG Fueling Stations   e. CNG Cylinders   f. Various Training aides   g. General Emissions Testing/Training  3) Provide Technical Assistance and Training  The NAFTC will use existing NAFTC Curriculum (Natural Gas Vehicles: System Integration and Service and Natural Gas Vehicles: CNG Cylinder Inspection and Certification) and materials to conduct a Train-the-Trainer class for 12-15 instructors.  These instructors will be determined by working with the US DOE, US EPA and Indian industry and educational organizations.  Information gathered during the initial days of the visit will be used to modify the training to meet the needs of the participants.  Training aids will be purchased and modified during this portion of the process or prior to instructors arriving in Delhi.  Specific items relevant to AFV technology being used in Delhi India will be included as time permits in the training.  The training will include technical material from the curriculum as well as instructional techniques that are used during the conduct of training technicians.  Instructors will be given Instructor Manuals and a list of the training aids required for the training. (Qualified instructors from National Training Centers of the NAFTC will be contracted to conduct the training.)  4) Assist with the Validation of Training in Delhi  The NAFTC will assist the Indian instructors in the methods used to establish validation processes for the training that is conducted.  This will include assistance with the development of evaluation instruments for the actual conduct of the instruction as well as measurement instruments for the skills/knowledge of the technicians that participate in the training.  The NAFTC will explain how the instructors use these results to modify their training methods and presentations.  The following will be provided:   a.  Student Evaluation Forms   b.  Pre-Tests   c.  Post-Tests  5) Travel for Participants  Travel will be required to and from Delhi, India from the US.  Travel requirements for each participant are as follows:   a.  To India   b.  From India   c.  In US (for preparation) ATTACHMENT 4 TIMELINE* *Due to the world situation and the attacks of September 11, 2001, the work listed in this statement of work will be accomplished using a timeline agreed upon by the U.S. Department of Energy and the NAFTC.  The NAFTC will make every effort to coduct the work contained in this statement of work within one year of the date of award of a purchase order. This purchase order is being issued to The National Research Center for Coal and Energy., because this vendor is uniquely qualified to provide the work required by the government.  Also, for the following reasons;  Soul-Source Justification India Training Proposal West Virginia University and the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC) are prime organizations to prepare and conduct the training necessary to complete the requirements for conducting training for technicians in India. The NAFTC is the only comprehensive provider of training for Alternative Fuels Vehicle technicians in the United States. The NAFTC has conducted meetings and visits with personnel from the US DOE, the Indian Government and Indian educational officials in preparation for the training to be conducted.  It has been instrumental in determining the training requirements and needs of the target audience.  The US DOE, US EPA and Indian officials have requested the NAFTC by name to participate in the training effort to enhance the AFV use in India. The NAFTC develops and delivers standard, competency-based training to automotive trainers, in-service technicians and others in the AFV field, and educates consumers about AFVs.  Current training modules include: Overview of AFVs, Forklift and Material Handling AFV Applications, Propane Vehicle Training, Transient Emissions Testing, Natural Gas Vehicles: System Integration and Service, Heavy-Duty Gaseous Fuel Applications, CNG Cylinder Inspection and Certification, Electric and Hybrid Vehicles: Technician's and Fleet Manager's Guides (under development), Overview of Ethanol Training (under development), On-Board Diagnostics II (under development), Overview of Liquefied Natural Gas Vehicles (LNG) and an Alternative Fuel Stationary Equipment Training (under development). By using and updating existing curricula available through the NAFTC, lead-time for conducting the training will be significantly reduced.  The development of the training will be greatly simplified and the proven training currently available will enhance the learning experience of the technicians and/or other participants.  The NAFTC programs also tap the capability of its member National Training Centers and Colleges and Departments at West Virginia University, including the expertise of WVU's Technology Education program, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering departments, the land-grant university Extension Service, and the National Research Center for Coal and Energy. This request is considered to be sole source to West Virginia University and the National Alernative Fuels Training Consortium.  Therefor, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  This award shall be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.  The Technical Representative for the above purchase is Mr. Eric Bell phone 412-386-5802

<DESC>SUBJECT:  PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMITTEE ON EARTH RESOURCES (CER) FOR THE NATINAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES/NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (NAS/NRC) DESC:  The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Petroleum Technology Office (NPTO), Tulsa, OK site intends to award a fixed priced purchase order to the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council to purchase the following: STATEMENT OF WORK Committee on Earth Resources The National Academies National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources Board on Earth Sciences and Resources The Committee on Earth Resources (CER) serves as the focal point for development of new activities relevant to mineral and energy resource affairs in the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources (BESR) and the National Research Council (NRC).  Committee members include experts in energy- and mineral-resource science and engineering, resource economics, and environmental policy and law.  Many of the Committee?s activities are in response to requests from the federal government for information on specific technical or policy issues.  The activities of CER and its ad hoc committees are subject to NRC review procedures to ensure balance and impartiality. The CER is responsible for providing analysis and recommendations relevant to the supply, delivery, and associated impacts of and issues related to energy, metallic, and nonmetallic mineral resources.  The committee (1) monitors the status of mineral and energy resource affairs; (2) identifies study opportunities and responds to requests from federal agencies; and (3) provides unique avenues for professional contributions from the scientific and technical community to government.  The CER accomplishes this through two mechanisms: (1) NRC reports, and (2) meetings, workshops, and symposia. NRC Reports The CER produces reports on: h Energy Resources Traditional (oil, gas, coal) and non-traditional (hydrates, He) h Mineral Resources Metallic and non-metallic including materials as diverse as aggregate and industrial minerals h Related Topics Program reviews Environmental impacts, particularly regulatory issues Sustainability Material flows Reports resulting from the work of the CER shall be prepared in sufficient quantity to ensure their distribution to the sponsors, committees, and to other relevant parties.  In addition, 6 copies will be submitted to Purna Halders at the National Petroleum Technology Office (NPTO) a part of National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) (phone 918-699-2084; FAX 918-699-2005; e-mail purna.halder@npto.doe.gov ; mailing address US DOE NPTO/NETL, One West Third St. Tulsa, OK  74103).  Reports may be made available to the public without restrictions. Meetings, Workshops, and Symposia Annual funding for CER will suppport: h approximately two meetings of the CER; h strategic planning and project development through discussions with agency representatives, policy makers, and leading scientists and engineers in industry, government, and academia; h oversight of studies to assure timely completion; h the initiation of workshops and symposia on topics of interest to the earth resources community; h systematically examine the expectations of outside constituents; and h consult with policymakers and other constituents. Current proposed studies for these meetings, workshops, and symposia include: Committee on Technologies for the Mining Industries; Preservation of Geoscience Data and Collections, and Material Flows. Committee on Technologies for the Mining Industries  This is a joint study by the CER and the National Materials Advisory Board.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center has a requirement to procure supporting hardware and software to upgrade the Main Propulsion Control and Monitoring System (MPCMS) Console used to train Electricians stationed onboard the 378? WHEC Coast Guard cutters.  The upgrade will consist of adding parameters to Woodward Industrial?s MicroNet? software to simulate various troubleshooting exercises during training sessions.  Woodward Industrial is the Original Equipment Manufacturer of the MicroNet? system, therefore it is the Government?s belief that only Woodward Governor can accomplish the required upgrades.  All technical and engineering data required to successfully upgrade this system is proprietary information to Woodward Governor, therefore it is believed that this nonavailability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition.  It is intended to award a sole-source purchase order to Woodward Industrial no later than 15 August 2002.  However, other sources may submit information detailing their capabilities to provide the required upgrades.  This information must include (1) complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the referenced control system was successfully manufactured and/or upgraded (i.e., salient physical, functional, and serviceability characteristics of all components involved), or (2) data that the offered system has been satisfactorily manufactured and/or upgraded for the Government or the OEM.   This information MUST BE RECEIVED IN THIS OFFICE WITHIN 15 CALENDAR DAYS FROM THE DATE THIS NOTICE IS PUBLISHED.  Information received after this deadline shall not be considered for this acquisition.  The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this purchase order, but will qualify the prosper for follow in acquisitions.  The Government does NOT intend to pay for information solicited.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.203-1 and TAM 1206.302.  The following statement is for information purposes only: ATTENTION: Minority, Women-Owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE's)!

<DESC>The United States Department of Education seeks capability statements from small businesses, as well as comments from all interested parties, on the proposed acquisition synopsized below and fully outlined in the attached draft SOW (follow the "Draft Statement of Work 01" link above).  

The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) in the U.S. Department of Education expects to request proposals for the development and maintenance of the What Works Clearinghouse.  The Clearinghouse will document what works in education in multiple topic areas, providing a national registry of educational interventions.   More specifically, it will be an easily accessible and searchable, web-based online database of products, programs, and practices that are claimed to enhance student academic outcomes.  Claims of effectiveness will be assessed with respect to the quality, quantity, and relevance of evidence, as well as the magnitude of effects of interventions--as determined through reviews of research.  It will also include a registry of evaluators who are prepared to conduct evaluation studies that will meet high quality standards as determined by the Clearinghouse.  

A core expectation of the Department is that the interventions in the  registry can be successfully adopted by a significant number of educational practitioners throughout the nation.  Therefore the system designed under the contract must ensure that listings in the registry have high potential for transportability to many other settings.  

The Department anticipates that major tasks will include:  1) developing and implementing a communication and collaboration strategy; 2) creating and supporting an expert technical advisory group to give feedback to the contractor; 3) developing standards and criteria for conducting study reviews and preparing evidence reports; 4) creating and maintaining a registry of evaluators committed to the Clearinghouse standards and criteria; 5)
identifying topic areas for broader evidence-based research reviews, and for test instrument reviews (optional); 6)  
conducting reviews of effectiveness studies and preparing evidence reports; 7) conducting special "fast track" reviews and syntheses (optional); 8) developing and supporting a web-based online system and databases.  

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  The Department is placing this notice to solicit questions and comments and begin an exchange of information with the public in order to release the best possible solicitation.  All interested parties should read the draft SOW by following the "Draft Statement of Work 01" link above.  

Capability statements from small businesses, as well as comments from all interested parties, should be submitted to Nicole Ragno, Contract Specialist, at Nicole.Ragno@ed.gov by 12:00 pm on Thursday, February 7, 2002.

Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror / quoter INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD.  Please ensure compliance with this regulation when submitting your quote.

This announcement constitu tes the ONLY solicitation; quotes are being requested and A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  Solicitation number / RFQ N00244-02-T-1069 applies; an electronic copy of the RFQ can be accessed at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-01 and DFAR Change Notices effective through 12/06/01.  The standard industrial code is 7382, NAICs #561621 And the business size standard is	$10.5 million. The agency need is for replacement of the current security system with an up-to-date, state-of-the-art automated access and alarm system. This requirement is for a firm fixed priced contract . The following salient characteristics are CRITICAL / ESSENTIAL to the Government:  1. SCOPE: The Naval School of Health Sciences San Diego (NSHSSD) has a req uirement to replace its' current Security System with an up-to-date, state of the art automated access and alarm system.   2. BACKGROUND:  The current system is 10 years old and does not provide adequate security (i.e. Security personnel cannot positively verify that all exterior doors are secure without constant physical rounds of the building and conducting a physical check of each door handle/lock) and is not capable of upgrade as it is incompatible with current automated technology.   3. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  Optimally the new system will replace the alarm and access control systems that currently exist combining the two into one comprehensive system.  Access to the NSHS San Diego needs to be controlled via an automated system. The new system should automate the security procedures of the NSHSSD by monitoring and providing computerized reporting.  At a minimum  the system should provide: a. Identification of personnel accessing the building; including who entered the building and when, where they entered, and additionally, provide details on those attempting to gain access and what entrance did they attempt to gain access to.   b. All information should be accessible from one central computer terminal (i.e. located at the watch stander's post on the quarterdeck of the command) so that security personnel will be able to view status of the doors being monitored.   c. 24 Hour/around the clock Alarm capability that will send an alarm signal to a 24 hour manned security post on the compound so that Naval Medical Center San Diego Security personnel can respond from a  to  mile away in the event that an alarm is triggered.    d. System must have the capability of being upgraded in the future to include security cameras,  motion detection devices, and other security/access system related upgrades in addition to potential integration with fire/smoke detection system/s in the future.   e. Employees should be able to access/enter any one of the 69 exterior entrances by utilizing a card swipe or proximity type scanning device (i.e. reader to scan a magnetic strip located                on an employee's personal identification badge/card). The optimal system will be configured                                                                                                                to read the current Military Identification Cards (which now contain a magnetic strip on the back of the card).  System should have the capability to permit personnel access to specific zones/areas       at specified times where their duties require them to be/but also have the capability to be programmed to rest rict or permit access to other areas/and at times when personnel should not be accessing those same areas/zones (i.e. Individual works in Area "A" from 0800 to 1600 and should have access to Area "A" during those hours, but not after/or before those hours.  Yet at the same time the individual can access common areas until 1800 when the organization entirely shuts       down/locks up for the evening). f. Security personnel should be able to request reports (viewable via computer screen or printed version) from the system that will report on who entered via which door and at what time, or who tried to gain entrance via what door and when.  g. The system should consist of control panels capable of controlling access and/or alarm for all exterior doors and some interior doors of the schoolhouse (approx. 80 doors in total). Optimally each door will have a monitoring (or acce ss control) device.  There needs to be a manual key punch code entry type device as well for instances when an individual       forgets their/loses their badge.  4. OTHER REQUIREMENTS: a. NSHS San Diego desires a "turn-key" system.  Vendor is solely responsible for the purchase of all parts and materials, transport of, storage of, and security of all parts, tools, and materials required and utilized during the installation process, and for the complete installation of the entire access/alarm system. b. NSHS San Diego desires at a minimum a one year warranty on parts, materials, and installation work.  Warranty should clearly specify that vendor is accountable for all defects    discovered in materials and/or installation for 1 year from the date of acceptance. NSHS San Diego will not accept the system until the system has been satisfactorily    demonstrated/tested w ith both vendor representatives and government representatives on hand/in attendance.  c. NSHS San Diego desires a quote for an optional preventive maintenance contract (billed on a monthly basis) for all equipment to be maintained as per manufacturer's specifications which will commence upon completion of the manufacturer's warranty plan. d. Current door locking hardware can be reutilized if possible/as necessary, but is not mandatory that it be a part of the new system.  e. The command contains 9 double doors that will require monitoring also.   f. The command desires on sight, hands on "user" training on the system after the system installation is complete for up to 20 personnel.  g. System installation should cause minimal to no disruption to the mission of the command (i.e. Training Institution with classes continuously being taught on 3 different floors fr om    0645 to 1600 five days per week - Monday through Friday). h. Contractor will be responsible to repair/replace any and all damages caused by/incurred during the installation of the Alarm/Access Control System. i. The government (NSHS San Diego) will furnish utilities required to complete this installation, and will dedicate one dual 110V wall plug for the Security System power    requirements. Contractor may utilize the facilities (bathrooms, vending, and outdoor lunch tables) while in the process of completing the contracted job. j. NSHS San Diego desires to review and have approval authority on the projected completion timeline before the commencement of any work and desires periodic (weekly) status updates    while the project is in progress.  NSHS San Diego desires a vendor's Quality Assurance point of contact be established  prior to commencement of any  work so that if/when liaison    becomes necessary this can be accomplished with minimal effort. 5. GENERIC LISTING OF MATERIALS REQUIRED:  Not by any means deemed to be "all inclusive". 9 Each Master Control Panels; 9 each Power Supply Units;38 Dual Port Interface units; 1 each Server Software w/plug; 1 each Programmed and Installed Personal Computer; 1 each 128B Power Pak; 69 each Proximity Readers; 69 each Door contacts; 69 each Door Lip Extensions; 500 each Magnetic Strip/Proxim.

DFARS 252.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items, applies with the following clauses applicable for paragraph (b): DFARS 252.225-7001, Buy American Act and Balance of Payment Program; and DFARS 252.225-7012, Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities; and FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal. OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications -  Commercial Items. The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. 52.212-2  EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS--OCT 1995 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT (ii)   PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)  PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet  the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is approximately equal  to Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.    (b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or tec hnical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.  (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance histor y and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has a sserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may  determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The purpose of this program is the standardization and validation of pre-clinical assays used in the development of topical microbicides.   The project will not include clinical validation of the assays.  The offeror must make contact with various investigators working in the field on cell/tissue-based and animal models for the pre-clinical assays and develop collaborations for participation in a MQAP.  Those contacts will initially include, but not be limited to, NIH-funded program projects.  The offeror will be required to coordinate and participate with the investigators in the design and implementation of the quality assurance program.  The program will include implementation of the standards of performance for existing and newly developed pre-clinical assays.  Independently, and in cooperation with the outside investigators, the offeror will facilitate the development, standardization and application of pre-clinical and analytical methodologies.  Therein, the offeror will be expected to acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents.  The offeror will disseminate the pre-clinical assessment technical and scientific data through multiple mechanisms, including publication in peer-reviewed journals.  To support the MQAP, the offeror will be required to maintain a computerized system and ensure a strong statistical component.  The qualified respondent must be able to demonstrate prior experience with laboratory quality assurance programs and methodologies and have the ability to coordinate multiple investigators at both a national and international level.  The required service is defined as code 541990 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The contract is anticipated to have an initial period of 9 months for setting up the collaborations, followed by a 51 month option period if the project organization is considered to be successful.   The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or before August 23, 2002 through the http://FedBizOpps.gov web site.  All responses must be submitted on or before October 8, 2002, to:  Virginia A. DeSeau, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Building, Suite 7A07, 6100 EXECUTIVE BLVD MSC 7510, BETHESDA MD 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A07, Rockville, MD 20892).

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for purchase of a Boeing Flight Deck System, which includes dual side-by-side, open cockpit with dual controls (modeled after the Boeing-777.)  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC intends to purchase the Boeing Flight Deck from Flight Link Inc, 275 Fairchild Ave, Suite 100B, Chico, CA 95973.  Flight Link has proprietary rudder pedals design that accurately presents pressure gradient and travel forces found in the B-777 aircraft.  Flight Link created the simulator flight controls (hardware and electronics) that are used by Boeing to develop the software for their B-777 full motion simulators.   This sole source is made under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b), for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Flight Link is the only known supplier for the Boeing Flight Deck System that will potentially meet the very challenging requirements in high-resolution display technology that is critical to our research and development goals.    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on 8/12/02. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer that shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for the fabrication/manufacture of one (1) Custom Vacuum System.  The system will form a part of the vacuum force balance being built at NIST under the Microforce Realization and Measurement Competence Project.*****The vacuum portion of the system (for which this solicitation is being written) comprises a large (approximately 3 ft diameter) custom base plate, collar, and bell jar with an appropriately sized pumping station that is intended to provide a stable, isolated environment in which to perform calibrations of small force measuring instruments.  The system is unique in that it must accommodate a variety of optical, electrical, and mechanical feed-throughs, be free-standing, and incorporate its own, clean-room-compatible lift for removing the bell jar to obtain access to the experiment located within.***** The custom vacuum system will need to interface with existing equipment at NIST.   Thus, vendors will need to view the laboratory space that is to house the completed system.  A Site Visit will be held on Wednesday, August 14, 2002, at 1:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST), to allow vendors to examine the laboratory area and required interfacing.  Prospective quoters are strongly encouraged to attend the Site Visit.  Failure to attend the Site Visit shall in no way constitute grounds for protest and/or claims by vendors.  Attendees will first assemble in Building 301, in the room adjacent to the Cafeteria, and will later continue on to Building 225.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  Due to increased security at NIST, Gaithersburg, vendors planning to attend the Site Visit must e-mail their intention to attend no later than close of business Monday, August 12, 2002, to Tamara Grinspon, at tamara.grinspon@nist.gov, providing name of company, name of each person attending, and country of citizenship.  For non-U.S. citizens, the following additional information will be required: Title, Employer/Sponsor, Address, and Subject of Visit (I'll fill in the last one), so that security personnel at the gate may be informed.  Vendors should come to the Visitor Registration Center at the NIST main gate (Gate A, off Bureau Drive) to pick up their Visitor's Badge.  Photo Identification will be requested at the NIST entrance gate.  No one will be permitted to enter the NIST campus without prior registration.*****Delivery is required within fourteen (14) weeks or less after receipt of order (ARO).*****The Government intends to award one purchase order to the vendor whose quotation will provide the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors included.*****A Request for Quotation (RFQ) document, along with Specifications/Drawings, is expected to be posted to Federal Business Opportunities (www.fedbizops.gov ) by August 12, 2002, although this date is subject to change.  Interested vendors should submit a quotation package in accordance with instructions provided in the solicitation document.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<ARCHDATE>09182002
<CONTACT>Jeanie Kampschroeder, Contracting Officer, GovWorks (703) 787-1352
<DESC>The combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services previously released is revised as follows. This modification is to provide additional information material to the preparation of proposals and clarification of solicitation requirements. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service and GovWorks Federal Acquisition Center (a Franchise Fund operation) seeks to solicit current GSA, Federal Supply Schedule contract holders for a competitive source selection for a business process review study of the Procurement Operations Branch (POB). Reference Request for Proposal Nr. 1435-04-02-86894. POB will conduct this acquisition under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 8.4. Offerors will be permitted the flexibility of proposing labor categories that cross over and combine any GSA schedule contract held by the Offeror, and applicable to this effort. Project objectives are to identify and baseline existing operational processes related to the POB functional responsibilities; internal MMS and GovWorks franchise operations are co-located and co-mingled. Additional information and understanding of the GovWorks Federal Acquisition Center can be viewed at  <http://www.govworks.gov/> www.govworks.gov. Scope of this project will be limited to the POB office in Herndon, VA. Functional responsibilities include, but are not limited to, acquisition strategy planning; customer requisition document review; pre-award, award, and post-award contract administration; source selection procedures; acquisition compliance review; invoicing; contract finance and accounting; close-out; and related business functions. POB current staffing consists of 45 permanent full-time employees and three temporary full-time employees throughout at least six distinct functional areas requiring review. Based on projected growth in franchise operations, future plans indicate a potential for a two to three-fold increase in personnel to keep pace with growing need for acquisition support services. Final deliverables will be an operational and functional process and procedures manual detailing current processes/procedures "as-is", at the flow step/task level; a new employee orientation and guidebook intended to assist new employees in transitioning into the POB environment and allow new employees to achieve productivity more rapidly; and an overall program strategic plan summarizing this project review and outlining the future of the POB to include recommendations to be used in determining the need for future initiatives for POB business process engineering. The Offeror must be prepared to relate the information collected at this stage to future organizational growth and process engineering. The successful offeror will be expected to perform the majority of this effort at contractor site; limited government site space may be available for interviews, IPT working groups, etc. Responses to this notice must include the following proposal contents: (1) Qualification Statement summarizing the Offeror's experience and capability to perform this type of effort. Identify proposed key personnel and project team to include background, education, work experience, accomplishments, and knowledge individual's have gained through efforts similar in nature. Describe organizational experience, facilities, and major logistical considerations. List references, to include description of the project, project title, contract number, period of performance, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official, address, and telephone number for similar contracts performed by proposed key personnel or the organization within the last two years. (2) Technical Proposal shall address general elements to include (a) Offeror's understanding of the background, objectives and work requirements; (b) proposed methods and techniques for completing proposed tasks; (c) discussion of how each task will be evaluated for full performance and acceptability from the Offeror's viewpoint; (d) potential difficulties and problem areas, and recommended approaches for resolution; major logistical considerations. Specific elements include (e) technical approach to include work breakdown structure; (f) approach to scheduling; (g) risk identification and mitigation; (h) knowledge and skills in business process review; and (i) experience and ability to work in an integrated team approach with POB staff. Technical proposal should include a discussion of lessons learned in previous projects of this nature and description of alternative and/or novel approaches to meeting the stated objectives. (3) Program Management Plan must describe proposed project tasks, responsibilities, and personnel; any proposed subcontracting arrangements; communication and coordination; scheduling of all tasks and subtasks, meetings, and deliverables. A program scheduling plan portraying critical areas of effort, significant milestones, and the schedule for completion of each milestone must be provided. (4) Cost Proposal reflecting appropriate labor categories, rates, and hours by proposed task, and any discounts offered. Focus on all the above proposal contents should be on clarity and conciseness in presenting this information in a meaningful way. The technical proposal and program management plan must be no more than 20 pages each. There is no page limitation on the qualification statement or cost proposal. The use of bullet statements to highlight items is encouraged. Any documentation in excess of stated page limits may not be evaluated. Technical questions regarding this solicitation must be received no later than August 2, 2002. Those Offerors determined to be within a competitive range based on evaluation of the above proposal contents and criteria stated below will be invited to make oral presentations. The Government reserves the right to limit the competitive range to the greatest number of offerors that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals, and permit a best value determination based on oral presentations. Oral presentations will be used to evaluate the Offeror's knowledge and understanding of the effort, reasoning ability and approach to solving the objectives of this project, and ability to work in an integrated team approach. Additional information concerning oral presentations will be provided to invitees. Evaluation criteria, weighted equally, are: (1) Technical Approach with subfactors (a) assessment and understanding of the work scope, including creativity and thoroughness shown in planned execution of the project; (b) discussion of specific methods and techniques for completing each task, (c) potential problem areas, creativity and feasibility of solutions to problems; (c) discussion of logistics, schedule, and any other issues the Government should be aware of; and (d) risk identification and mitigation strategies. (2) Past Performance with subfactors (a) organization history of successfully completing projects, producing high-quality reports and other deliverables, staying on schedule and within budget; (b) quality of cooperation amongst key individuals in the organization, and quality of cooperation between your organization and its clients; and (c) organizations' demonstrated reliability in the completion of past projects of this nature; and (d) achievement of client (Federal or corporate) formal certification level three assessment or higher using an industry-accepted business process maturity model. (3) Key Personnel qualifications with subfactors (a) currency, quality and depth of experience of individual personnel in working on similar projects; (b) quality and depth of education and experience on other projects relevant to this effort, and publication history. (4) Organizational Experience with subfactors (a) degree of comparability of past projects to the current project, including number of projects, complexity, and dollar amount. Supporting subcontractors, consultants and partners will be considered. (b) Appropriate mix and balance of education and training of team members. (c) Experience and ability to approach the effort alongside the Government as an integrated team. Future process engineering requirements such as process, metrix and tool development, implementation, maintenance and sustainment may arise as a result of this project. For informational purposes, the applicable North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611, applicable size standard is $5.0 million. This is not a small business or other set-aside. A time and materials type task order is anticipated. The anticipated performance period will not exceed six months. To be considered, proposals must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Time on August 19, 2002, at Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170, Attn: Jeanie Kampschroeder. NOTE THIS IS A PROPOSAL DUE DATE EXTENSION.

<DESC>1.  Under Section C-1, item 5 (provide data on individual patients by diagnosis and site of infection) and item 6 (correlate resistance with drug utilization), should an offeror's proposal include methods and costs to provide these services? 
If an offeror is capable of providing the services, then the methods and costs associated with those services should be provided.
2.  Under Section C-1, item 7 (provide data from all major census tract regions in the U.S.), if an offeror submits a proposal that covers a city, for example, inclusive of 6-10 healthcare facilities, that geographically span the city, is that sufficient for this proposal?  How does the FDA envision a contractor that can provide data from all major census tract regions in the US?  
Item 7 is reworded to read: Provide data from major census tract regions in the U.S. or from a variety of sites serving a range of patient populations in one geographical area.  Section M-2, Technical Evaluation Criteria, sub-criterion Extent of Geographic Coverage within the U.S. is further defined to include: Collecting information from a variety of sites serving a range of patient populations in one geographical area would be an alternative to geographical diversity.  Although the extent of geographical coverage is a factor that is considered in the overall evaluation, it is not essential that the contractor be able to provide data from all major geographic census tract regions.  A proposal that covers a smaller region (e.g., one large city) could be acceptable, especially if the quality and specificity of the data are high.  All factors contributing to the quality of the data, as defined in the RFP, will be considered in awarding the contract.
3.  The response date for proposals is August 19, 2002 at 2:00pm local time.

<DESC>Computer Resource Specialist Service For The Family Support Center Located At Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland.  Solicitation number FA4416-02-T-0025.  The following has been changed:      (A)   Date for quotes has been extended until 11 Jun 2002, 4:30 p.m. eastern time.  	

(B)  The contractor is required to submit resumes for the people they anticipate will fill the position.  These resumes are required to be submitted with the contractor's quote.  

(C)  The contractor is required to submit present and past performance information for same or similar work, Government or commercial, which has been performed in the past three years.  Three to Five will be sufficient.  This information shall consist of the following:  Contractor Number, Type of Work Performed, Dollar Amount, Location, Valid Point of Contact and phone number.  

(D)  The following additions/changes are made to FAR 52.212-2, which is incorporated by reference (http://farsite.hill.af.mil/): 

The ?blank in paragraph (a) of this provision is completed as follows:


BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in which the offeror?s past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations.  By submission of its? offer in accordance with the instructions provided in this RFQ, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records.  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:

	i.  Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price, including any option prices.  The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated under the following subparagraph B, the completeness, and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.

	ii.  Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek performance information on the lowest priced offerors (usually the lowest four to five quotes) based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Generally, the contracting officer shall not seek information on the evaluated higher priced offers unless it is determined none of the lower priced offers are acceptable for award.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror?s ability to perform the effort described in this quote, based on the offeror?s demonstrated present and past performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, none, marginal, or unsatisfactory.   Offeror with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating of ?none,? meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.   

	iii.  If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have an exceptional performance risk rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.   Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.
         
        iv.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of ?very good? or lower.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.

     	v.  Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in this quote.  Offeror?s may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposals (e.g., the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical error will not constitute discussion and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award without the opportunity for proposal revisions. 

      vi. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussion if deemed it?s best interest.

(E) All prospective offerors interested in submitting a proposal must have a commercial and government entity code (CAGE Code) and be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) at www.ccr2000.com

(F)  Quotes must be received no later than 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on 11 Jun 2002.  Quotes may be mailed to: 89th Contracting Squadron, 1419 Menoher Drive, Andrews AFB, MD 20762 (ATTN: Stacy MacKay).  E-mail quotes will also be acceptable.  E-mail quotes must be sent to Stacy.MacKay@andrews.af.mil .   If quotes are forwarded via facsimile than the offeror must notify Stacy MacKay at (301) 981-2308 or email. 

(G)  Clarifications, questions and answer from the site visit held on 30 May 02 will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunity webpage at www.eps.gov.

<DESC>The work under this procurement consists of the contractor providing all labor, material, equipment, transportation, administration, and supervision to conduct surveys of threatened, endangered, or rare plants at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar, California.  Work may include surveying approximately 7,000 acres for 17 rare plants that potentially occur on MCAS Miramar, collecting and mounting plant species, mapping the location and extent of each plant species, and drafting various reports as may be required.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541620.  This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.  The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract.  Firms responding to this solicitation must show experience consistent with the following evaluation factors:  (1) past performance information; (2) technical experience/key personnel qualifications/requirements; (2A) Bachelor?s degree with an emphasis in botany, ecology, or a related science; (2B) three years of local experience in identifying and surveying for rare plants within The Jepson Manual?s floristic province entitled ?Southwestern California, South Coast (SW SCo);? (2C) a familiarity with rare plants found within coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian, vernal pools, and oak woodland flora and ecology, autecology, and soils experience); (3) price.  When the proposal is evaluated, Factors 1 and 2 are equal in importance.  Within Factor 2, Subfactor 2B is considered more important than Subfactors 2A and 2C.  Notwithstanding the relative importance of Subfactors, the influence of the Subfactors will depend in large measure upon the nature and range of actual variation in differences among the proposals received.  In general, the greater the range of quality of the proposals received for any technical Subfactor, the more influential that Subfactor will be.  [For example, if the difference between the best and worst proposals on Subfactor 2A is great, while the difference between the best and worst proposals on Subfactor 2C is small, then Subfactor 2A will be more influential than Subfactor 2C when the Government determines which offer represents the best value.]  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1 and 2 combined are approximately equal in importance to Factor 3.  The source selection process will identify whether offerors meet the evaluation criteria specified, and select the responsive, responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  The award will consist of a base year and four one-year option periods.  The minimum guarantee for the contract is $2,000.00.  Work will be ordered on individual Task Orders placed against the contract.  The availability of the solicitation will be limited to electronic media; the solicitation will be available for viewing and downloading, free of charge, via the electronic solicitation website:  http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  The official planholder?s list will be maintained on, and may be printed from, the website.  All prospective offerors and planrooms are required to register as planholders on the website.  Notification of any updates or amendments to the solicitation will be posted on the website only.  IT IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OFFEROR TO CONTINUALLY VIEW THE WEBSITE FOR CHANGES.  The solicitation will be made available approximately August 16, 2002.

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR PART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO EXTEND THE CLOSING DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS TO CLOSE OF BUSINESS (3:30 P.M.) ON AUGUST 21, 2002 AND TO INCORPORATE THE RESPONSES TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE SOLICITATION:1)  QUESTION: Is there an incumbent for this work?  If so, who is the incumbent and what is the current contract number?

RESPONSE: No, there is not an incumbent contractor for this effort.  The work is currently being performed in-house.

2) QUESTION:   What are the requirements for turnaround time for technical editing projects?

RESPONSE: As specified in Section B.8, "Service Levels," the required productivity rates for editing are as follows:

Level 1 - 8 to 12 double-spaced pages/hour
Level 2 - 6 to 8 double-spaced pages/hour
Level 3 - 3 to 6 double-spaced pages/hour
Level 4 - 1 single-spaced page in 1.5 to 2 hours

In addition to the times listed above, the NRC will allow a total of 8 hours for pickup and delivery of each manuscript.

3) QUESTION: Does the Government expect to have more than one technical editing project or more than one manuscript editing project assigned simultaneously?  Is so, approximately what percentage of the projects in each category might occur simultaneously?

RESPONSE: It is entirely possible that the NRC will issue multiple, overlapping delivery orders for technical editing and/or pre-print manuscript review services.  However, given that the various manuscripts may have vastly different turnaround times, it is highly unlikely that two concurrent manuscripts would have identical pickup and delivery times, and it is impossible to project the percentage of delivery orders that might occur simultaneously.  The contractor should be assured, however, that the NRC will work with him, within the constraints of the agency's priorities, to negotiate a reasonable deadline for each delivery order.

4) QUESTION: What is the anticipated date of award?

RESPONSE: We intend to award the contract by September 30, 2002.

5) QUESTION:  Do you have an estimate of the page per hour required to complete the Manuscript Review tasks?

RESPONSE:   The NRC defines productivity rates and service levels for pre-print manuscript review services in working days, rather than pages/hour, because each manuscript submitted for review has its own unique characteristics.  However, for planning purposes, offerors should estimate an average of approximately 25 pages per hour.

6) QUESTION: Under Section B.3, SCHEDULE OF ITEMS AND PRICES, third paragraph, it is  stated that "the NRC estimates that pickup and delivery or technical editing and manuscript review orders will require 120 round-trips per year between the Contractor's facility and the NRC Headquarters located in Rockville, Maryland.  What is meant by this?

RESPONSE: This means that the contractor has to physically come to the NRC facility to pickup and deliver the orders.  Due to the nature of the work and the short turnaround times, there is insufficient time to allow for other delivery methods, i.e., Federal Express or Airborne Express.  Since the contractor is required to pickup the delivery order within four hours of receipt of order, the contractor will have to be located within four hours of Rockville, Maryland, in order to satisfy this requirement.  However, couriers may be used provided the documents are picked up with the required timeframe.

7) QUESTION: What is your estimate for completing NRC Form 379 or NRC Form 20?

RESPONSE: The time required to complete NRC Form 379 is negligible, since the form is completed in the process of reviewing the given manuscript.  NRC Form 20 requires approximately ten (10) minutes to complete, and the NRC will provide all of the required data as part of the manuscript review package provided to the contractor.

8) QUESTION:  We have the total estimated quantities given as the total number of pages.  However, it would be helpful for us to know an estimate for the volume of Brochures, Staff Reports, Conference Proceedings, International Agreement Reports and Contractor Reports.  Can you provide the estimates for each of these areas?

RESPONSE: The estimated distribution of manuscripts submitted for review is as follows:

Brochures			 4 percent
Staff Reports			30 percent
Conference Proceedings		 4 percent
International Agreement Reports	 2 percent
Contractor Reports		60 percent

NRC cautions offerors that they should not use this information in preparing their cost proposal for this solicitation.  The service level for manuscript reviews reflect a variety of factors in addition to the expected productivity rates.  For planning purposes, offerors should use the average productivity rate of 25 pages per hour.

9) QUESTION:  Under Section B.8, Service Levels, Sub-section (a) Manuscript Review, does the "Turnaround Time (work days)" equate to the estimated effort required for each type of manuscript?  For instance, can we assume that it would take 2 days (16 hours) to perform all the tasks required for Brochures, 4 days (32 hours) for all the tasks required for Staff Reports, etc.?

RESPONSE: The service levels for manuscript reviews reflect a variety of factors in addition to the expected productivity rates.  For planning purposes, offerors should use the average productivity rate of 25 pages per hour.

10) QUESTION:  Under Section B.3, Schedule of Items and Prices, Option Year 4 is missing an entry for Item No. 5a "Technical Editing (Weekday)."  Is this a typographical error?  What is the estimated quantity for this entry?

RESPONSE: Yes it is an error.  The estimated quantity for Technical Editing (Weekday) is 7,390 pages for Option Year 4.

11) For the Manuscript Reviews, is the vendor expected to attend the Conferences, Seminars, etc, to successfully meet the expectations of the Conference Proceedings deliverables?

RESPONSE: No.  The NRC will provide the contractor with the completed conference proceedings, in the same manner used for all other manuscript review categories.

<DESC>NA The Government intends to raise the dollar threshold and combine contract periods under contract DACA31-99-D-0007. The contract is an Indefinite Delivery-type multi-discipline contract advertised in the Commerce Business Daily June 8, 1998, for the Baltimo re District Army Corps of Engineers. The contract was awarded to Baker and Associates, Airport Office Park, 410 Rouser Road, Corapolis, MD 15108, for one base period of $1,000,000 and two option periods of $1,000,000 each. Under this contract, Baker and As sociates designed the Renovations of Building 39, Fort McNair, Military District of Washington. Due to insufficient funding, a construction contract could not be solicited at the time the design was completed. Since that time, the customers, the Fort Myer Military Community and the Military District of Washington, have requested changes to the design due to revised requirements. The value of this modification, approximately $200,000, will cause the total value of the orders to exceed the $3,000,000 limit of  this contract. Since a rigid schedule for design must be maintained, issuance of a modification to the contract is in the best interest of the Government. Therefore, the Baltimore District is intending to issue a modification to the contract to increase t he contract values from $3,000,000 and combine the periods into one period for a total value of $3,500,000.  The contractor completing this work will have to assume full liability for the complete the project within budget and schedule; and satisfy the des ign effort of this project, the Installation, and the User.  Interested parties should submit requests not later than 9 August 2002. Contact is Susan Sonenthal, susan.j.sonenthal@nab02.usace.army.mil This is not a request for proposal.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

The Forest Inventory and Analysis program (FIA) of the USDA Forest Service is seeking information on technologies for field data collection, quality assurance/control and submittal to a central data processing facility and the corporate database which is currently Oracle 8i.  THIS IS NOT A COMMITMENT FOR SERVICE.  After an initial information-gathering period, if FIA then decides to contract vendors who have expertise in this area and an interest in working with us to develop the necessary tools, a separate bid process will be initiated.

The system will include support of 450+ data recorders that operate in an occasionally connected environment.  The system must support collection of all national core variables, as well as provide easy customization to include regional variables specific to each of its five stations (geographic areas).  In some cases, specific variables need to be added by state.  National core variables include data on trees, soils, vegetation, ozone content, down woody debris, etc.  Regional variables typically expand on these core variables and provide information on items of regional interest, such as regional tree damages (e.g., disease, insects) or tree grading.  The data collection process needs to include verification of legal ranges for each value as well as extensive cross-checking between variables within tables and between tables.  

A Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) system must also be incorporated that allows plot data verification to log and compare QA/QC crew values with original field crew values.  Final edited data will integrate with the corporate Oracle database at national level.  The prospective system must allow the Forest Service full access to any custom code.  This will allow modification of the system as needed throughout its life cycle to meet our changing needs.  Other requirements, such as geographic information systems and/or GPS integration, are very desirable to be included at some point in the system design, but are not a top priority in the initial implementation.    


PROOF-OF-CONCEPT (POC) PROCESS

Technology is changing at a very rapid pace.  There are many system development options available for the mobile computing environment.  The Proof-of-Concept process that we are conducting will be to gain knowledge on available solutions and evaluate usability, maintainability, and integration capabilities with our corporate database (currently residing within Oracle 8i).  The goal of the POC is to determine the specific ?architecture? that is most appropriate for FIA.  The POC results will be reviewed by the entire field data recorder community of the Forest Service, as a part of our internal information sharing.  

We are inviting you to prepare a POC system to demonstrate to the FIA PDR (Portable Data Recorder) Team.  This is in no way intended to be a complete prototype, but rather to provide one or two examples of each requirement listed.  Although we would prefer to see a system that is based on the included Oracle export database (FIAField.dmp), we will view systems that have a similar background database structure and can demonstrate the items we have specifically identified under ?Items to Include in Demonstration?.  The presentation will include an overview of the proposed system architecture, demonstration of the items requested, and an overview and demonstration (where possible) of the specific concepts found under ?Main Concepts?.  A number of handhelds will be provided for testing and interactive demos.  You may choose to bring your own handhelds, but we also request that sample software can be installed on two of the handhelds that we provide.  Specific handhelds are posted  under ?Items Provided?.   

The meeting will take place the last two weeks in August at the Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) in Ogden, UT.  We expect the presentation and interactive demo to be approximately 90 minutes in length with a 30 minute question/answer period to follow.  This time may have to be adjusted depending on the number of respondents to this POC.  If you would like to participate in this process, please respond by July 19, 2002.  Details of the August POC Demo Schedule will be sent after confirmation of vendor interest.  A second confirmation will be required on or before August 9, 2002 after being assigned a time slot to verify you will have a system to demonstrate.  


FIA OBJECTIVES

To determine an appropriate architecture for our system and verify the need for pursuing a Request For Proposals to develop our system.  Our overall timeframe for this system includes system development winter/spring 2003, extensive field testing throughout the development process beginning summer (field season) 2003, and implementation beginning nationwide for the 2004 field season.  Full implementation must be completed by the 2005 field season.  


MAIN CONCEPTS (Requested Written Responses, Demos if Possible)

Please respond to the following concepts in writing, and where possible include in your recommended system architecture design.  If not included in your system design, please provide a detailed explanation describing why you are not recommending the use of that particular ?concept?.  If included in your system design, please include in your demonstration.

1.	What would be the best way to manage a national data collection program that would allow maintenance of national core variables separate from regional variables?  This would basically be the equivalent of maintaining five individual systems that share a common national core.  In some cases, customization may need to go beyond even this to the state level.

2.	We are interested in the concept of an ?application generator?.  This program would recreate applications for data recorders based on the database fields specified (e.g., National core variables plus  North Central variables) and the data recorder specified.  Once an application was generated for the specified region, then it could be customized to allow for specific crew preferences (e.g., order of variables, pick lists, ?).  Please explain whether this would be a viable option for the FIA system or outline your suggestion for a better approach.  Could further customization be made available to the user on the data recorder?  Could multiple configurations be saved for easy-to-select settings?

3.	Is it possible to maintain one program, possibly using an application or forms generator, for use on multiple data recorders with different screen orientations and sizes?  How difficult and/or easy would this be and what would be the related opportunity cost on maintenance of each different screen size and orientation?

4.	The feasibility of using a development environment that would ?generate? a program that would run on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Palm) and its subsequent effect on performance and field usability.  If this is not feasible for your system, please explain.

5.	The feasibility of using a database as a source for data validation criteria.  The database would be used for organizing and maintaining these validation rules, and would be fully searchable and updateable.  It would include range checks, cross checks between fields within a table and cross checks between fields in different tables.  It could contain specific SQL or PL/SQL code that would define the edits and be referenced by the data recorder and desktop edit programs to perform data validation.  (Please see ValidationExamples.zip, especially the Example_SQL_edit_database.doc within.)

6.	The feasibility of utilizing a mobile GIS solution to access coverages and landscape information on the handheld computer to help navigate to a plot.  Once on the plot, the feasibility of collecting our data spatially with our comprehensive validation checks.  Would performance delays slow our crews down working with spatial information and coverages?  How would we manage providing coverages for each plot?  This will include GPS units and may also include technology such as the laser rangefinder for gathering spatial information (heights, distances) on individual trees.  How would your system implement this initially or plan for future integration with these technologies?

7.	The feasibility of having multiple data collection devices on a single plot networked using a wireless technology such as Bluetooth to keep the data sync-ed between the multiple devices.  In addition to networking multiple devices running the data collection forms/software, what are the possibilities for utilizing wireless connections between peripheral devices such as GPS units (just starting to be released with Bluetooth), laser range finders, digital cameras, etc.

8.	After seeing the scope of the project, please provide ballpark cost and time estimates for project completion.  This is not expected to be ?the estimate? for the project, but will allow us to plan for our budget needs and approval for this project.  


ITEMS TO INCLUDE IN DEMONSTRATION
To provide comparable testing for vendors who will not use our database:  Minimum 12 tables with total of 160 fields.

Please document and provide an overview of the proposed system during the presentation.  
State your demo system specifications (Laptop and handheld: speed, memory, processor, ?) and any system development software (e.g., Visual Studio) and database software (e.g., Oracle Standard Edition 9i on laptop, SQL Server CE on the handheld) and include in written overview.

Plan to demonstrate your handheld software on a minimum of two of the machines listed under ?Items Provided?.

System development and maintenance:
1.	Drop a variable and corresponding edits from the national core.
2.	Add a tree variable that only appears when the tree status is recorded as ?1? or ?live?.  Include the corresponding edits to the NC regional variable list.
3.	Change the order of the variables on the handheld form
4.	Change the datatype of a field.
5.	Add a range/value edit showing each step.  Also demonstrate validating from a list of values instead of a range.
6.	Add a cross-field validation rule showing each step.
7.	Add a cross-table validation rule showing each step.
8.	Replication system: demonstrate available settings.
9.	Initiate/setup auto-handheld software update and demonstrate.
10.	Print files directly from recorder, from laptop.

ATTACHMENTS

FIA_POC_Introduction.doc
This document in Word format.

FIA_System_Requirements_7_2_02.doc  
This document contains software requirements that FIA is planning to incorporate into the final system design.  (Hardware requirements are not included in this POC.  At this point, FIA is planning on making hardware selections on a station by station basis once a system is developed. 

NCCoreManual_ver1_6.pdf
The North Central Research Station (NCRS) Field Manual v1.6.  This will match a good portion of the data in the Oracle export file.  Please Note:  Phase 2 (P2) Inventory variables are defined in Sections 1-8.  They typically consist of ?tree data? that are collected on all forested plots.  Phase 3 (P3) Inventory variables are described in Sections 9-14 and are only collected on a subset of the forested plots.  The sample database FIAField only includes the P3 variables that make up additional tree data (Section 12).  The new national system will include all of the variables found in Sections 9-14; but they are not intended to be included in the POC other than to plan for P3 modules.
 
FIAField_Oracle_dmp.zip
-	Sample FIA Field Database (FIAField.dmp).  This is a portion of a field database being used by the North Central Research Station provided in Oracle export format.  It includes North Central regional variables in addition to the national core variables for all P2 data and P3 tree data only.  Regional variable names are preceded with an "NC" in the column names.  
-	Import Instructions for FIAField.dmp (FIAField_Import_Instructions.doc).  These instructions must be followed carefully to install to your trial copy of Oracle Standard Edition and import the FIAField schema.
-	Crosswalk between columns of the sample database and the NCRS Field Manual v1.6 (FIAField_Columns_to_Manual_v1_6.xls).  This will provide a detailed crosswalk between the FIAField sample database columns and the NCRS Field Manual.  The second worksheet also lists the state-cycle-subcycle combinations that are manual v1.6 compliant.

Set of regional variables from the Southern Research Station (SRS_Regional_Variables.doc).  This word document outlines the variable names and types from the Southern as an additional example to NCRS?s to maintain one national and 5 station-level modules of within the system.  It is intended that the vendor demonstrate a few variables from each of these stations to adequately describe the suggested ?maintenance? of these multiple modules.

ValidationExamples.zip
Here are examples of systems used in FIA to track validation checks.  The validations need to be automated as much as possible to avoid maintenance in multiple locations.  There is a strong possibility of using a database to maintain these edits and their SQL code in a single location that will automatically update both handheld editing software and laptop/desktop editing software.  We are very interested in new ideas and suggestions.
-	National Programming Requirements for National Manual v1.6 (P2-3_programming_requirements_v1.6.doc).  This document lists programming requirements for variables from manual version 1.6 including name, phase, width, business rules, range and list checks, ...
-	National Logic Checks for National Manual v1.6 
(P2-3_logic_checks_v1.6_highlighted.rtf).   This file provides examples of the extensive checking that occurs between data fields and tables.  A few examples have been highlighted to focus on, possibly for inclusion in POC system or something similar.
-	Example of an edits database (Example_SQL_edit_database.doc) currently used for cross-field validation checks of P3 data from the national P3 database.  This is not necessarily the design we are interested, but may provide an idea for an "Edits Database".

<SUBJECT>J -- A-10 Market Inquiry Day Announcement
<DESC>OO-ALC will be conducting a Market Research Inquiry Day on 20 Aug 02 in the POE Conference Room, Building 1295, at 0730-1600 hrs, Hill AFB, Utah.  The A-10 System Program Office and OO-ALC Depot are currently in the process of a major overhaul/inspection/refurbishment program with the objective to extend the A-10 aircraft's lifecycle from a projected 8,000 flying hours to 16,000 hours. The purpose of the forum is to bring together leading authorities from the Department of Defense, education, and industry in an effort to learn about the latest alternative engineering techniques and repair applications to the A-10 aircraft structural and wing surface areas as well as techniques for removing/replacing wing fuel sealant and Non Destructive Inspections. We invite leading authorities from education and industry for an information sharing forum, which will include a tour of the A-10 wing repair facility and the Hog Up production hangar.

The Government is not soliciting offers at this time and there is no funding available.
This is a market research inquiry which will include a briefing and site tour.

<SUBJECT>59 -- CCA RADIO FREQUENCY MONITOR
<DESC>F-16 Circuit Card Assembly

This announcement constitutes the fulfillment of Public Law 2319 and is the periodic announcement of a Qualification Requirement, which is available for the manufacture of the Circuit Card Assembly Radio Frequency Monitor, P/N 785R537G01, NSN 5998-01-303-5871WF.  The Circuit Card Assembly Radio Frequency Monitor is a component of the RF Monitor Board Assembly located in the Dual Mode Transmitter of the APG-68 Radar used on the F-16 C/D.  The Monitor Board receives a peak detected voltage from the Dual Mode Traveling Wave Tube (DMTWT) and converts an analog voltage to an 8 bit digital word, which is sent to the Controller Board. The Monitor Board monitors the status of the Traveling Wave Tube (both Driver TWT and DMTWT).  This status includes cathode voltage, collector voltage, and DMTWT body current.  Additionally, the Monitor Board Assembly incorporates a multi-hybrid package (MHP) that contains the RF fault circuitry.  The circuitry monitors for arc detection and excessive reflected power.  Upon an RF fault, the Monitor notifies the PSP via the DIGIBUS.  Although the F-16 Logistics Operation Division does not have an immediate requirement, this notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  Interested parties may request a source qualification statement from 2Lt Michael P. Weinheimer at 801-775-4613 or michael.weinheimer@hill.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>--New Generation Army Targetry System Request for Information
<DESC>NA It should be explicitly noted that the U.S. Government makes no official commitment nor obligation to procure any systems or services at this time by the release of this information. BACKGROUND:   The Army Targets Management Office (TMO) intends to develop a New Generation Army Target System (NGATS) to replace existing target systems on live fire ranges. This NGATS target system will be made up of families of targetry components that are interchange able and provide the required performance at a low life cycle cost.  Compatible NGATS components will be deployed on Army training ranges in a sequential or blocked program where each block represents increases in performance, reductions in cost, or both. The NGATS program is scheduled to begin fielding ranges in late FY06 with a Block I NGATS system. The schedule for fielding Block II or subsequent blocks will be set at a later date. In order to implement Block I, the Government has begun requirement definition and system design activities with a design integration contractor, Computer Sciences Corporation, Inc. of Huntsville, AL.  As a part of this design activity, the Government, alo ng with the design integration contractor, will develop and provide system requirements and interfaces that target system components must meet.   During the remainder of FY02, FY03, and most of FY04, the Government intends to sponsor a series of Industry Days including the design integration contractor and interested target industry companies to present the progress of the design and interface defin itions. Technical input from industry is strongly desired at these meetings. Industry comment on the progress and direction of the Government's activities will impact the content of the interfaces that NGATS Block I targetry components must meet. The Gover nment's intent is to have a family of each type of system component that will meet the interface requirements and provide a spectrum of price/performance to satisfy the large spectrum of Army range types and requirements. Beginning in late FY03 and continuing through FY04, the Government plans to operate a facility at the Redstone Arsenal where targetry component manufacturers can have their products tested for conformance to the requirements/interfaces. In late FY04, the G overnment will contract on a competitive basis, with a Production Integration Contractor to integrate and test a range system consisting of components that have been shown to meet the requirements/interfaces. Following the successful tests/demonstrations o f the  prototype targetry system, the Production Integration  Contractor will  install targetry systems on Army live fire ranges. Options for post warranty support of the installed ranges will be included in this contract for the use of range operators. In stallation of NGATS Block I ranges is expected to continue for several years. NGATS Block II and any subsequent releases will be produced as a result of future procurement actions to introduce technology advancement and satisfy new training requirements. Such releases will be integrated and tested by a competitively selected product ion integration contractor who upon successful test/demonstration will be directed to install targetry systems on Army live fire ranges. The Production Integration contract will include a Hardware, Software and Services Exclusionary provision that will impose a restraint upon future business. This is necessary to preclude potential conflicts of interest and prevent the existence of a confli cting interest that might bias the Production Integration Contractor's judgment.  Please see subpart 9.5, Federal Acquisition Regulation, 'Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest'. REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION: To identify the requirements for NGATS we have developed a Program Requirements Guidance Document (PRGD) that incorporates the NGATS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), Weapons Systems Field Manuals and ORDs from related range and targetry developments.   In order to make the PRGD easier to read and understand, ascertain that all true requirements for training targetry are contained in the document, and ensure that requirements statements do not unnecessarily exclude solution by any particular technology we  are providing the document for review and comment by training related organizations. Government offices associated with training/test ranges; targetry component manufacturers; and range installation, operation, and maintenance contract organizations are i nvited to download the documents available at ngats.redstone.army.mil and provide comments to Ms. Tanya Davis electronically, by the close of business on 15 August 2002, at tanya.davis@redstone.army.mil. A response form for use in providing multiple commen ts is available from Ms Davis. Receipt of the information (comments, or suggestions about the PRGD) that is supplied by an organization does not imply that the Government will incorporate any suggestion or take any action recommended. Information supplied by organizations will not be pr ovided to any office or organization outside of the TMO, the Aviation & Missile Command-Research, Development & Engineering Center, and their support contractors.  Any information considered to be proprietary must be identified with appropriate markings. N o information or documents should be mailed to the Government and nothing will be returned. No follow-up meetings will be held with individual submitters. The support contractor personnel indicated above are employees of Analytical Services Inc., SPARTA, C omputer Sciences Corporation, Ohio Technologies Corporation (OTC), and Kottman Inc., all of Huntsville, Alabama. These businesses have signed non-disclosure agreements with the Government with respect to NGATS related information. The results of this RFI will be presented at the next NGATS Industry Day which is tentatively scheduled for 27 August 2002 in Huntsville Alabama. Detailed information about the Industry Day will be announced in this forum at a later date. Any information p rovided in response to this RFI that is mentioned or discussed at the Industry Day meeting will not be attributed to any specific source but may be associated with a generic Government or contractor origin.
