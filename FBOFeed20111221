<DESC><p>Description<br /><br />Department of the Air Force, Air Force Material Command, Air Force Research Laboratory - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514. Point of Contact: Robert Scott, Contract Specialist, Phone (315) 330-4753, FAX (315) 330-7179.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Information Directorate has a requirement for software development and system support to satisfy the requirements of the Information Processing for Data to Decision Making (IPDDM) Program. IPDDM supports the missions and functional requirements of the 35th Intelligence Squadron (35IS) (AF ISR Agency/70th ISR Wing) and the Air Force Command and Control Integration Center (AFC2IC) through research, development, integration, implementation, enhancement, and sustainment of new and existing capabilities in the areas of data and information processing capabilities to improve data for decision making at all echelons across Air Force, Intelligence Community (IC), Joint, and Coalition air, space, and cyberspace components, systems, and architectures. Functional areas include: Intelligence; Network Analysis; integrated air, space and cyberspace Command and Control (integrated C2); airborne networking; C2 Information Warfare (C2IW); Command, Control, Communications Countermeasures (C3CM); Information Operations (IO); Cyber Network Operations (CNO); Information Warfare (IW); Electronic Warfare (EW); Command and Control, Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Network Centric Warfare (NCW); General Military Intelligence (GMI); Modernized Integrated Data Base (MIDB); Cyber Network Operations Database (CNODB); non-kinetic/kinetic targeting; strategy development; operational assessment; and standardization, integration and interoperability. Systems processing integration across Capability Users' functional and mission areas in support of improved integrated operations and intelligence will be a major IPDDM activity and focus area.</p>
<p>Successful performance under this effort will require the ability to support the full technology development and lifecycle process, from intelligence and operational requirements refinement, analysis of alternatives, prototyping, experimentation, and development, to successful transition to the operational environment for warfighter use. The successful approach will involve research, development, integration, implementation, and sustainment of data and information processing capabilities to: (1) improve data for decision making at all echelons across Capability Users' air, space, and cyberspace components, systems, and architectures pertaining to the functional areas; (2) improve relevant technologies, software, systems, information operations, and data handling performance and capabilities; (3) advance the current functional and mission capabilities by leveraging these improvements; (4) be highly responsive to evolving and volatile operational and user needs and operating environments; and (5) incorporate new versions of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and newly developed (Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS)) software wherever it makes sound technical, financial, and mission sense and is in the best interest of the government.</p>
<p>Successful performance will require the successful offeror to: (1) participate in development, exercises and demonstrations, integration testing, and sustainment activities with various operating environments within the AF, Intel, Joint and Coalition communities.</p>
<p>Anticipated deliverables include a variety of products as specified by the IPDDM Capability Users. Examples include: final technical reports, exploratory models, CONOPS, technical and planning documentation and reports, experimental and operational computer software, databases and associated documentation, updates to existing Government documents.</p>
<p>The successful offeror must be able to provide: (1) approximately 140 Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) cleared personnel, including some with NATO and Higher Access; (2) capability to provide on-site support at certain Capability User locations, including government SCI Facilities (SCIFs); (3) an in-house SCIF to emulate evolving Partner sites and relevant mission systems to support development, testing, integration and sustainment; and (4) all facets of working with Export Controlled information and activities. Interested parties are advised that to perform this acquisition the successful respondent will be required to have at the time of award 100 personnel with TS/SCI clearances and within 60 days of contract award the contractor must have a total of 140 personnel with TS/SCI clearances.</p>
<p><br />Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level. The successful contractor may receive and/or generate technical data subject to export control in the performance of the contract. Therefore, offerors must provide a completed and approved DD Form 2345 with their proposal which certifies the offeror is on the Certified Contractors Access List (CCAL) or that the offeror is seeking application to CCAL. The successful offeror must have a completed and approved DD Form 2345 prior to award. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Information Service at 1-877-352-2255 or on the web at <strong><a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a></strong>. It is solely the responsibility of the contractor to obtain an export license from the U. S. Department of State and to comply with the federal laws and regulations. Questions concerning the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export licensing must be directed to the U.S. Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and not the AFRL Program Manager, Contracting Office, or Air Force Foreign Disclosure Office.</p>
<p>An Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) - Research and Development type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of forty-nine (49) months. The acquiring agency anticipates that approximately $49.6 million will be sufficient to cover orders for the duration of the ordering period.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard for small business is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the small business capability packages received in response to the previous Sources Sought notice resulted in a determination that a small business set-aside was not appropriate. The successful offeror will be selected as a result of full and open competition.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal in response to the RFP which shall be considered.</p>
<p>The Draft Request for Proposal is expected to be posted for review and comment by potential offerors in late January or early February 2012. The formal solicitation is expected to be released in early March 2012. Refer to the web link in this notice for any milestone changes.</p>
<p>THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES (FEDBIZOPPS) WEB SITE AT <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/"><strong>http://www.fbo.gov/</strong></a>. FedBizOpps offers a registration service that will send an e-mail notification when a change is made to this announcement.

Include your company's name, address, telephone number and point of contact, fax number, e-mail address and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. The Contract Specialist will post this list on the FedBizOpps along with the solicitation to facilitate subcontracting and teaming opportunities only. Offerors registering their name either on the FedBizOpps or with the Contract Specialist should not conclude that they will receive a paper copy of the solicitation in the mail. Paper copies will not be available. The solicitation and any amendments thereto will only be available by downloading the documents from FedBizOpps. All prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of amendments (if any) or other information pertaining to this solicitation.</p>
<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from respondents, potential respondents, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Brian Shepard at 315-330-4533, Brian.Shepard@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (APR 2010) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Barbara G. Gehrs, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-904-4407. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the AFRL level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force Ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number 703-588-7004, facsimile number 703 -588-1067. The Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contract Specialist.</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Government New/Unused Surplus may be considered.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:
<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Space Command, Space and Missiles System Center Space Superiority &amp; Development Planning Directorates (SMC/SYK), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA, 90245</p>
<p>I. Description / Purpose:</p>
<p>1. The SMC Development Planning Directorate (XR) is issuing this presolicitation notice to provide the industrial base with information about XR's CHIRP+ WFOV payload acquisition and upcoming market research plans.</p>
<p>2. XR and the Infrared Systems Directorate (IS) are planning to hold an industry day in the second half of January 2012 to communicate to industry SMC's plan to procure up to three wide-field-of-view (WFOV), overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) sensors to be launched as hosted payloads or free-flier rideshares. XR and IS will also present to industry how these sensors will fit into IS's OPIR architecture and discuss future plans for integrating, launching and operating these sensors. In addition, XR and IS will be accepting Statements of Capability (SOCs) from companies interested in building the sensors and offering them the opportunity to have one-on-one meetings with program office representatives. The market research for the CHIRP+ procurement will be based mainly on the SOCs received at industry day; no sources sought synopsis will be posted on FBO either before or after the industry day.</p>
<p>3. The only procurement currently being actively coordinated is for the development and delivery of high TRL (Technology Readiness Level), flight-capable sensors. The sensors will be either 6-degree or 9-degree WFOV IR sensors intended for use primarily for battlespace awareness and secondarily for other OPIR missions. Cost will be a very important consideration, due to funding limitations. Currently, the Government is limited to spending $40 million or less per sensor. The Government intends to award three contracts for sensors to be developed and delivered within a 36-month schedule.</p>
<p>4. Two weeks prior to industry day, the Government will release the following documents and information: A draft Statement of Work (SOW); a draft Technical Requirements Document (TRD); SOC content and format requirements; and logistical specifics of the industry day. Currently, the industry day is planned to be held at SMC in El Segundo, California. The SOW and TRD are currently being drafted, and no drafts have been released to industry yet. The first draft releases will be for the formal industry day notice, which the Government plans to post to FBO in the first half of January.</p>
<p>5. The Government is building a bidder's library where finalized draft documents will be posted. The draft SOW and TRD for Industry Day will be posted to this site as soon as they are ready. The process for gaining access to this site can take up to two weeks, so contractors are highly encouraged to apply immediately. The following information is relevant to gaining access:</p>
<p>a. The LAAFB Contractor Livelink Site Guide will inform your organization of your responsibilities.</p>
<p>b. All contractors need to fill out the Livelink User Agreement and the SAAR Form DD2875.<br /><br />c. Every contractor needs to have an Information Assurance Certificate which can be attained from the link. The link to the IA CBT: http://iase.disa.mil/eta/iaav9/iaa_v9/index.htm</p>
<p>d. Every contractor must have an External Certification Authority (ECA) or a Common Access Card (CAC) to use the Livelink environment. The ECA's are available at http://www.verisign.com/dod-interoperability/index.html. Contractors should purchase from this website.</p>
<p>The LAAFB Contractor Livelink Site Guide, Livelink User Agreement and the SAAR Form DD2875 have been attached to this pre-notice. The Livelink User Agreement, SAAR Form DD2875, and a copy of the IA CBT Certificate should be submitted to the points of contact listed in Section II of this notice NLT 3 January, 2012 to allow sufficient time to process and approve access to the bidder's library.</p>
<p>6. The Government encourages participation from the small, disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p>II. Point of Contact: All communication associated with this presolicitation notice and the upcoming industry day shall be submitted via email to the contracting POC for this procurement, Mr. George Sullivan, at George.Sullivan@losangeles.af.mil. The alternate POC is Mr. Andrew Mitchell, at Andrew.mitchell.ctr@losangeles.af.mil.<br /><br />III.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intend to release RFQ R12PS13120 on or before December 29, 2011 for the purchase of synthetic belting material to be used in a traveling belt style fish screening device.
Basic information and supporting facts:Fish screening devices are used to prevent fish from being flushed into and through irrigation diversions, suction pumps and hydropower turbines. National Marines Fisheries sets the criteria as to how these systems are to be engineered, constructed and maintained. State Programs (Idaho, Oregon, California, and Washington) as well as Federal Agencies throughout the Pacific Northwest are held to these criteria when impact is apparent on anadromous and salmonid species within a stream that is listed as endangered or threatened.
Reclamation maintains three different types of fish screens. They are:Rotary drumFixed Plate Traveling Belt
Although rotary type screens are most prevalent throughout the Northwest, there are situations where the performance of fixed plate and traveling belt screens are used. When pumps are installed for 'pumping plant' situations the most often used screening device is the traveling belt screen.
A traveling belt screen is similar to the conveyer belt type operation used in shipping plants, warehouses and food processing plants. In these applications the conveyor belt operates on a horizontal plane whereas, a traveling belt screen operates on a vertical plane. The screen travels around a frame, therefore blocking the path of fish that may be sucked into the pumping equipment.
Criteria for the material can be found at www.nwr.noaa.gov / Anadromous Salmonid Passage Facility Design. Specifically Chapter 11 / Fish Screen And Bypass Facilities. This document can e-mailed by request to Connie Morgan: cmorgan@usbr.gov

<DESC><p>This is a presolicitation notice for the following:The Combustion and Kinetics Group within the Chemical and Biochemical Reference Data Division (CBRDD) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops, models, and applies spectroscopic methods and disseminates reference data for measuring trace gas concentration in relevant environments. The culmination of these efforts supports the development and deployment of sensor technology. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate is developing a conformity assessment program for commercial chemical sensors used in homeland security. NIST is funded by DHS to review and develop ASTM International (ASTM) voluntary consensus standards, test methods, reference data, and standards to validate the performance of commercial chemical detectors using challenge vapor streams containing toxic industrial chemicals and background chemicals that potentially affect detector performance.</p>
<p>The work to be conducted addresses important gaps in the existing capability for chemical detector evaluation and calibration. The contract deliverable is to improve public health and safety through more effective chemical threat detection achieved by accurate and reliable identification of chemical contaminants and the contamination level. To meet this goal, the CBRDD requires expertise to develop and document draft reference measurement methods. These methods will be used by testing laboratories, government agencies, and practitioners to assist in the independent evaluation of chemical detection equipment procurement and program planning for the development of next generation capabilities.</p>
<p>Contractor support is required to provide support to develop and disseminate measurement tools to improve the accuracy and reliability of chemical measurements related to homeland security and defense, e.g. measurements of toxic industrial chemicals. To address these needs, the Contractor shall conduct research to develop new reference methods and reference data to support the evaluation of commercial chemical detectors. Deliverables shall include a method to mathematically evaluate complex infrared spectra for the sample's chemical constituents and chemical concentrations. Deliverables shall also include the development of real-time analytical methods for verifying relevant challenge streams and draft documentary standards to be submitted to ASTM.</p>
<p>The specific tasks pursuant to this effort are described in the Performance Work Statement to be included in the solicitation when issued. It is anticipated that the solicitation for this work will be issued on or about January 21, 2012, using FAR Part 12, Commercial Item Acquisitions utilizing FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The Government anticipates the award of a fixed price Order with a base period of 12-months and two 12-mo. option years. The competitive solicitation, all amendments, and any questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The solicitation will only be available via the internet at the above website. Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the website. Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant Purchase Order. There is no written solicitation document available, telephone requests will not be honored, and no bidders list will be maintained.

<DESC>     This procurement will result in the award of up to four Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design-Build contracts to successful 8(a) contractors. The work will primarily consist of Design-Build, Construction Contracts for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) roofing, demolition, repair of facilities and infrastructure including but not limited to: 1) barracks and personnel housing facilities, 2) administrative facilities, 3) warehouses and supply facilities, 4) medical and dental facilities, 5) abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including but not limited to asbestos, lead paint and PCBs), 6) the civil, sanitary, storm water, mechanical and electrical systems for the Area of Responsibility (AOR) of PWD Mid-South Contracting Office, NSA Mid-South, Millington, TN.
 This Area Includes But is Not Limited To: Naval Support Activity Mid-South, Millington, TN and Large Cavitation Channel, Presidents Island, Memphis TN.

     The estimated value for all contracts is $10 million. Each contract will be for one base year and two option years. The anticipated range for each task order is between $25,000 to $2,000,000. This range is for information only and may vary. Proposers will be evaluated using the Two Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other non-price factors considered.
Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase of up to 4 offerors (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include: Relevant Experience and Capability of Key Personnel, Past Performance, and Safety.
 Phase I design-build factors relate three year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including new construction, roofing, demolition, routine renovation and repair of facilities and infrastructure, not just the seed project to be identified in Phase II RFP. Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed to Phase II.

     In Phase II, the selected Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals for the seed project. Offerors who fail to submit their Phase II technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the seed project, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality requirements of construction.
 Price proposals may include total price evaluation or evaluation of scope/design options, with the Governments published budget for award. The best value offeror will receive a contract for the seed project and the best value offerors will receive minimum guarantees. Up to four IDIQ design-build contracts will be awarded for a maximum three year term. If there is more than one seed project, the offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Size Standard is $33.5 M.

     After award of the initial contracts, the successful offerors will compete for task orders based on either Trade Off or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.
 The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. The task order statement of work may be written based on a Government/Contractor Team cooperative scope of the work. Tasks orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.
 Projects may require incorporation of sustainable design features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract. All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the trade off or low price, technically acceptable. If the Government decides to issue the task order as a trade off, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one or more of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.

     The solicitation for this contract will be posted on NECO on or around January 6, 2012

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

First, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to release the solicitation for the follow-on competitive contract to the Special Operations Forces Deployable Node-Medium (SDN-Medium) Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) requirement in January 2012. Second, and solely as a bridge to complete the competitive follow-on effort, it is necessary to increase the current SDN-M contract H92222-06-D-0007 with L-3 Global Communications Solutions of Victor, New York, by $50M. This increase is also needed due to an accelerated pace of contract requirements in response to USSOCOM's operational tempo as it prosecutes the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Justification for this bridge increase and pursuit of non-competition is that there is no other approved or available contract vehicle for SOF SDN-M systems available. Moreover, it is expected that there would be substantial duplication cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</span>

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Product Group (PG) -12, Program Manager (PM) Tactical Communication Systems (TCS), Platform Integration has a requirement for handsfree communications inside the Medium Crawler Tractor (MCT).  The headset system offered must be commercial off the shelf.  Headset manufacturers will be invited to demonstrate their headset capabilities, which must include hands-free" operation.  Handset Manufacturers that meet the requirements of the solicitation will have their pricing proposal evaluated.  NOTE:  Competition will be limited to the Handset Manufacturers.  Offers from dealers will not be considered.

A solicitation will be issued on or about 06 January 2012.

BACKGROUND: 
An Urgent User Need Statement (U-UNS) was received by MCSC from the operating forces requesting the ability to communicate from within the armored cab of the Medium Crawler Tractor (MCT) in a "hands-free" mode while equipped with hearing protection.
 
Platform Integration (PI) Team, PM TCS, worked with the platform PM and has devised a solution to allow the operator to communicate while operating the MCT. With some modifications, the PI Team was able to integrate the AN/VRC-113 into the MCT (see pages 21-22 of the attached Thales Product Catalog). After the AN/VRC-113 integration, Initial tests were performed using current inventory Active Noise Reduction headsets with Push-To-Talk (PTT) and Voice Operated Transmitter (VOX). 
MCT operation is controlled through the use of two joy sticks. The operator uses both hands to control MCT blade motion (up, down, tilt, roll) and travel (engine rpm, vehicle speed, vehicle turning), etc. With both hands utilized to operate the MCT, the operator cannot activate a PTT switch on the headset when he needs to communicate; hence, the issuance of this notification.

Performance Specifications
- Headset system must be commercial off the shelf.
 No development costs will be borne by the Government.
- Headset system must provide some form of Active or Passive Noise Reduction. 
- Headset system must be Hands-Free. The Platform Integration Team has designed a bracket to house a foot PTT which will be at the operators left foot. The PI Team has also procured a finger PTT which attaches to the right joystick (Blade up/down, tilt and roll). 
 	> If vendor is offering their own finger PTT, the device must be of a design that allows for uninterrupted keying and fit the contour of the joystick while remaining in place. 
 	> If vendor is providing a system that primarily uses voice activation (VOX) to key the radio, it cannot be the only method of keying radio.
 As the operating environment will normally be quite noisy, there are questions as to the effectiveness of VOX in the MCT while in operation in a combat environment. 
- Headset system must be compatible with USMC current inventory headsets which come standard with a Nexus connector. The Vendor shall have the ability to provide their proprietary headsets provided this requirement is met.
- Headset system must be able to draw power from pin #6 of the handset connector on the AN/VRC-113 AMP. This power should be the primary source of power. If battery power is required by Vendors headset system, it must be of such a design to allow effortless replacement of batteries and where possible, cut over to vehicular power once connected.
 
	> Vendors will also be required to notify the Platform Integration Team of the expected lifetime of the batteries in their system under normal use.
- Headset system must have an auxiliary input connector where the MCT operator can connect either a pre-recorded briefing or input media from another device.
	> The headset system must work in such a way that when either incoming or outgoing traffic is sensed, the input to the auxiliary port will be muted.  Once radio transmission is complete, auxiliary input returns to previous level.
- Vendor shall make provisions to mount the headset system in a semi-permanent manner. Headset systems control box shall be mountable on the right side of operators seat with cables of sufficient length to connect to the AN/VRC-113 AMP, auxiliary input, foot and/or finger PTT, and headset.
- Vendors must demonstrate a complete system.
 The system and components demonstrated must be of a readiness level high enough where the testers can install the system as if for fielding. 

Source Selection
- Selection will be made on best value to the Government. The best system need not have the lowest price to be selected.
- A Technical evaluation will be conducted hands-on. Vendors are required to install their headset system into the MCT and an MCT operator and Program Manager will evaluate the headset system based on the Performance Specifications listed above. 
- Any offeror whose product does not meet the specifications will not be selected.
- Offerors that meet the qualifications will be evaluated for delivery schedule (1st 65 units and following 150 units), past performance, and price.
- On the day of the event, vendors will be given one hour and forty five minutes to set up and demonstrate their system.
 Time slots will be set by MCSC Program Office based on vendor interest. 
- Pricing must be submitted by separate correspondence to MCSC contracting officer listed on solicitation.
Cost Breakdown
- Vendors must include the following price breakdown in the proposals:
	> Cost per headset and peripherals (1) each
	>Total cost for quantities listed below.
	> Total cost for spares listed below.
	> Step-Ladder pricing if applicable.

QUANTITIES:
- Current Urgent User Need Statement is for 209 systems, with a request from the PM, MCT for 60 to fill the U-UNS of those in theatre, and 149 installs (3 in CONUS used for training and83 for future principle end item rotations). Each MCT will need one Headset with hands-free peripherals.
- Initial contract will be for a maximum of 215 installation kits, a minimum of 63 complete Installation Kits that include Headsets, 146 Installation Kits excluding Headsets, and 6 sparesInstallation Kits with Headsets (see Sparing below).
	>Vendor must state estimated delivery time after receipt of purchase order.

SPARING:
There is no historical data to indicate what percentage spares are needed.
 Platform Integration is estimating that since headsets are not as robust as the vehicles they are in and are easily lost or stolen, we would need to spare at 10%.  Offerors are encouraged to provide recommended sparing quantities.  MCSC estimates a quantity of 13 units would serve as spares. However, due to the approved funding for the U-UNS, an initial purchase of 6 spare systems would be purchased for the 63 systems used for training and ISO OEF operations.  Numbers of systems initially purchased will vary based upon the unit prices and the available funding.

The offeror should include the individual components (i.e. cables, and line replaceable units) needed as spare parts to support the system being offered.
  Pricing should be provided to reflect economical price breaks with a minimum order quantity of one (1) each.

WARRANTY:
- Vendors will specify the type of standard commercial warranty they provide with the headset solution:
	> What is the length of warranty period
	> What is the process for operators to have warranty items repaired
	> What is the turnaround time for warranty repairs
	> What is the cost of extending the warranty, if needed

 SET-ASIDE STATUS:   N/A
SUMMARY:
The Construction and Valuation Section (C&V) of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)'s Loan Guaranty Service (LGY) is responsible for the quality of appraisal reports on properties offered as security for VA guaranteed loans.  Historically, lenders submitted appraisal requests by telephone to a local VA Regional Office (RO).  Each RO managed a fee appraiser panel for its jurisdiction.  The fee appraiser panel is comprised of VA-approved independent appraisers.  VA assigned the appraisal to an approved fee appraiser located in or near the area where the subject property was located.  The completed appraisal report was mailed or hand-delivered to the RO for review and subsequent issuance of a Certificate of Reasonable Value (CRV) by a VA Staff Appraiser.
The CRV forms were later replaced by Notifications of Value (NOV).  As automation advanced, lenders started requesting appraisals electronically and an automated VA system provided the name and contact information for the assigned appraiser.
Shortly thereafter, VA began authorizing lenders to perform reviews of completed appraisal reports and issue NOVs through the Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP).  The lender's Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR), usually an underwriter employed by the lender, received training by VA staff on the review process and issuance of the NOV.  This procedure currently remains in effect.  Although LAPP is a voluntary program, at this time approximately 96% of the total volume is processed under this program.
In 2002, VA completed a nationwide initiative that consolidated 46 ROs with loan guaranty operations to nine (9) Regional Loan Centers (RLCs).  This allowed some efficiency; however, as VA moves forward, it is essential that proven technological advances be taken advantage of in order to improve resource management and to continue providing quality benefits to our nation's veterans, in a more cost efficient manner.  This requirement will support the procurement of Automated Appraisal Management Services (AMS) and Automated Valuation Model (AVM) services to further enhance the appraisal review process, thereby improving the oversight functions of C&V.
Veterans Benefits Administration's (VBA) objectives are listed below:
1.	Improve the credibility and quality of individual appraisal reports.
a.	Create quality benchmarks and standardized scoring method and metrics for appraisals.
b.	Identify systemic quality issues.
2.	Improve the quality of individual appraiser performance.
a.	Create quality benchmarks and standardized metrics for individual appraisers.
b.	Identify appraiser-specific quality issues and deficiencies.
c.	Contribute to appraiser-specific remediation plans, including identifying competency gaps requiring training.
d.	Contribute to the development and refinement of role-specific training curriculum.
3.	Automate, streamline, standardize, and improve the appraisal review process.
a.	Continuously enhance the collection, reporting and accuracy of data, product features, integration, process/service design, and usability. 
b.	Leverage existing resources to perform targeted and more detailed oversight. 
c.	Improve the quality and consistency of the appraisal review process.
d.	Reduce the time and cost associated with processing an individual appraisal review.
4.	Decrease risk to Loan Guarantee (LGY).
a.	Reduce risk of fraudulent/non-credible valuations.

The scope of work will include project management, AMS and AVM services, associated training, customer service, operational data reporting, IT and Online Accessibility of Information (to provide system security, establish protocols, schedule and conduct maintenance, provide search/sort/and retrieval options, QAP and recovery plan), audit, and oversight.  A proven and previously fielded Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product is required which must be capable of integration with VA systems.  The COTS product must be available at the time of award and the initial implementation of AMS and AVM services shall encompass the design and integration of these services into the C& V environment within six (6) months of contract award and ensure future enhancements align with the Change Management Action Plan.  This will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. 
The Government intends to make one award as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contract (ID/IQ) will have a five (5) year period of performance. The solicitation will be issued during the 1st Quarter of 2012.  Proposals are anticipated in approximately 30 days from the RFP distribution date.

<p>The E-4B serves as the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) for the National Command Authorities (NCA) and provides a worldwide-deployable, enduring node of the National Military Command System (NMCS) to fulfill national security requirements throughout the full spectrum of conflict. It is a modern, highly survivable, command, control and communications center to direct U.S. forces, execute emergency war orders and coordinate civil authorities' activities, including national contingency plans. <br />The E-4B sustainment program will involve logistical support and sustainment of aircraft, engines, avionics, and mission systems; with the potential for modifications including structural and avionics (racks, equipment and wiring); and both recurring and non-recurring engineering services.

Additional requirements include: training, electrical/power load, environmental Control Systems, stress and structural, physical configuration, wiring and other reference designators, systems engineering support, detailed design engineering, design change analyses, system and subsystem integration, technical analyses, drawing and technical data maintenance, software development, maintenance, and support; technical order development, maintenance, and updates; Government Furnished Property maintenance, Engineering Change Proposal preparation and submission, flight safety analyses, reliability and maintainability analyses, ground and flight test support, program analyses, design study preparation, cost estimation, schedule development, accident investigation, engineering feasibility studies, material deficiency report analyses, field problem investigation, failure analyses, configuration management, and in-flight emergency response.</p>
<p>Qualified contractors and/or subcontractors should have knowledge of Boeing 747-200 design, structures, and propulsion, along with access to E-4B specific engineering, configuration, sustainment, aerodynamics, electronics, hardware, software, support equipment, training devices, system integration, and communication systems. Contractors must have access to suitable facilities, tools, equipment, and personnel to provide all E-4B services and have the ability to certify or get certification to Military, commercial, or FAA airworthiness standards as required.<br />. <br />Contractors responding to this Sources Sought Synopsis shall submit the following information electronically no later than July 6, 2011, 4:30 PM EST to michael.moore@tinker.af.mil.</p>

This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.

The Government reserves the right to contact the submitting parties, on an as required basis, for further clarification on material provided. The Government will evaluate the information provided, use it to document our market research and develop the RFP. In addition, the Government will use its evaluation of the information and other research to determine the sources that appear qualified to perform the work required by the Government. The Government intends to release the RFP only to those respondents who are deemed qualified for this requirement based on their initial response. <br />Point of Contact <br />Steve Moore, Contracting Officer, Phone (405) 739-4451, Email: michael.moore@tinker.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>Irrigation, Planting, and Maintenance Requirements for Laguna Division Conservation Area
This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.  
The purpose of the project is to restore, enhance, and protect native riparian, wetland, and aquatic habitats within The Laguna Division Conservation Area Project (LDCA) for the benefit of LCR MSCP covered species and other plants and wildlife.  The project will create a mosaic of marsh and riparian areas.  Multiple meandering channels will be constructed and the hydrology of the site will be managed to create and sustain three specific land cover types: cottonwood-willow, honey mesquite, and marsh that meet LCR MSCP conservation criteria for target species of mammals and birds.  The LDCA is located on Bureau of Reclamation land along the lower Colorado River downstream of Imperial Dam and upstream of Laguna Dam.  The project area encompasses approximately 1,250 acres of tamarisk shrub land and wetlands along the abandoned river channel between the Laguna Settling basin and Mittry Lake Wildlife Area.  To maximize the benefits of a limited amount of water, the project area will be managed as a levied wetland system.  Water for irrigation and habitat creation will be supplied via pipeline from the fore bay of the Gila Settling basin spillway.  A constant 100 cubic feet per second will be provided to the project area and will be controlled through a 48" pinch valve located north of the project area. Water surface elevations in the wetlands will be controlled by a series of water control structures between wetland cells that will help to flood irrigate woody species.  Timing of water delivery between cells is critical since the downstream cell is dependent on flows from the upstream cell.  The following tasks are required under this project; 
1.	Management of the irrigation systems o	The irrigation system will initially be operated manually and then be operated remotely.  Reclamation will be responsible for the remote operation; however the contractor should be familiar with software and also how to operate the system manually.o	The contractor will be responsible for the operation of the two overshot gates and a turnout gate.  The schedule for the operation of the overshot gates will be given to the operator.  Initially the overshot gates will be operated on 8-day intervals during the plant establishment, once the hydrology cycle is established a permanent schedule will be established according to the season.o	Daily logs of operation, maintenance and problems encountered will be provided to the project manager on a monthly basis.  The need for major repairs or replacement of irrigation system components will be coordinated with the project manager on a timely basis to prevent interruption in irrigation service to the plants.2.	Invasive weed species management o	The contractor will provide weed management and vegetation maintenance services from initiation of clearing and excavation to the time the native vegetation is established and self maintaining (estimated 5 years).  The contractor will be responsible for day-to-day decisions affecting weed management.  The scope of work focuses on control and removal of nonnative plant species, primarily salt cedar / tamarisk, phragmites and/or arundo.  This vegetation can quickly spread and dominate riparian and marsh areas.  o	Personnel handling herbicide must have an applicator license for the states of Arizona and California.
3.	Hand planting of upland vegetationo	The scope of work focuses on planting of deep pot mesquite that will be planted in holes approximately 6 feet deep or moist soil depth, whichever is encountered first.  Since these mesquites will not receive any irrigation it is important to plant in or near the water table. Marsh plantings will require personnel to be in water depths of approximately 1 foot.  o	Some areas of the marsh site will require willow pole planting.  The willow poles will be harvested from one of the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) sites in Blythe, California or Cibola, Arizona.  The contractor must possess knowledge of pole collection, storage and planting.4.	Reporting of pertinent data for the Laguna Division Conservation Area (LDCA) to the project manager to support Lower Colorado River Multi Species Conservation Program (LCR MSCP) goals for marsh and riparian habitats along the LCR.  
The contractor must provide all personnel, equipment, tools and materials supervision and other items and services necessary to perform irrigation management services, herbicide application, invasive plant removal, and hand planting.  These tasks will commence with ongoing ground clearing activities for excavation of the site and continue through five years post planting to ensure that the vegetation is well established and self maintenance of the vegetation community is achieved. 
Construction of the water delivery system, removal of non-native vegetation and excavation of the channels began in the fall of 2011.  Once established the LDCA project should be essentially self-sustaining, requiring only flood irrigation controlled by the water control structures.  However, frequent irrigation and weed management will be required until the plantings have become established and reached a density that can resist invasion by non-native species.The project area is divided into three management cells.  The cells are divided by levees with maintenance roads and water control between the cells is provided by overshot gates capable of regulating the elevation of the water surface in each cell.  Reaches 1 and 2 cover the majority of the site and will be operated as flood pulse systems.  Flow into Reach 2 is dependent on outflow from Reach 1 and irrigation management must coordinate water needs of the two cells.  Reach 3 is a short outfall reach that is designed to mediate the irregular pulse flows from the Reach 2 outfall and pass them into the Laguna Project Area above Laguna Dam.  The fourth reach, the historic river channel, will be operated as a steady flow system.  This habitat is designed to take advantage of high ground water tables in the reach and will provide important habitat for California black rail and other shore birds that are intolerant of water level fluctuations.   NOTE: There are 2 maps available that show the project area.  Please contact the Contract Specialist, Liz Bailey at eebailey@usbr.gov if you would like the maps emailed to you. The project period of performance (5 years) is anticipated to begin August 1, 2012 with an anticipated completion date in 2017. 
Responsible sources are welcome to submit a capability statement on or before 12:00 PM on January 20, 2012.  Submittals will be reviewed and considered by Reclamation during the solicitation planning process. Send your capability package by email to Liz Bailey at eebailey@usbr.gov or mail them to Liz's attention at P.O. Box 61470 (Bldg 1400 / 160-A), Boulder City, NV 89006-1470. Your package should include the following information:

The Sherman Building was constructed in three major phases beginning in 1851 and is composed of at least three types of timber and masonry load-bearing structure. The building is located within the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Historic Landmark and is designated a Key contributing resource to the Armed Forces Retirement Home Historic District in the National Register of Historic Places. The following services are required for this project: <br /><br />1. Restoration of the Building Exterior: This work is divided into two parts.<br /><br />a. Part 1 is the restoration of damaged areas of the building's parapet, chimneys, and exterior walls. Restoration will include reconstruction of areas of masonry structure by hoisting and placing back onto the building a minimum of 380 stones of different sizes and profiles that either fell during the earthquake event or were removed from the building during emergency stabilization efforts following the earthquake. Some of the fallen stones were broken or otherwise damaged; hence, repair or in-kind replication of those stones will be required prior to reconstruction. AFRH created an inventory of the fallen/removed stones that will be available as baseline documentation for the restoration effort. The contractor must determine what method(s) of reconstruction to employ to both restore the appearance of the building's exterior and ensure long-term preservation and stabilization of the building. <br /><br />b. Part 2 is to restore the building's clock tower. Restoration will include removal the existing stones of the clock tower of the building and reconstruction of the tower using the same stones. During the earthquake, these stones shifted, destabilizing the structure of the clock tower; the upper portion of the tower is currently stabilized by a system of temporary straps that will remain in place until work commences on Part 2 of this project. Restoration of the tower also includes work similar to that described in Part 1 for stones that fell or were removed from the tower during and after the earthquake. <br /><br />2. Restoration of Select Building Interiors: A comprehensive report is available indicating all areas of work required in the restoration of the interior of the Sherman Building where damage occurred during the earthquake and during subsequent exposure of the interior of the building to the elements. The damage will necessitate repairs to plaster (flat and ornamental), doors, windows, skylights, painting, flooring, etc. <br /><br />3. Repair of Building Structure: Some of the wood roof rafters and floor joists supported by masonry bearing walls were damaged during the earthquake; some masonry bearing walls were also compromised due to falling stone though the roof and floor structures of the building. This part of the project includes repairs to or in-kind replacement of, where necessary, the damaged roof rafters, floor joists, masonry bearing walls, etc. <br /><br />4. Historic Preservation Compliance and Approval: Design and construction work shall comply with historic preservation standards and guidelines, including but not limited to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, NPS Preservation Briefs, and treatment recommendations in the AFRH-W Historic Preservation Plan. The Offeror is also responsible for obtaining all necessary approvals from the District of Columbia State Historic Preservation Office (DCSHPO) and National Park Service (NPS) associated with the agency's compliance with federal historic preservation laws, namely the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and associated regulations. <br /><br />Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list.

<DESC>TITLE: Research and Analyses of Clinical Pharmacology of Tobacco Products <br />OPDIV : FDA, Center for Tobacco Products (CTP)
<p>Background: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) in accordance with FAR 7.104(d). The potential small business will need to demonstrate the capability to perform all facets of a clinical pharmacology study from initiation and conduct of the study through the data analyses phase and preparation of the final reports.</p>
<p>History: The primary function of the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA" hereinafter) is to promote public health associated with the use of foods, dietary supplements, cosmetics, drugs tobacco, and other products under its jurisdiction. FDA's Center for Tobacco Products ("CTP" hereinafter), implements PL 111-31 and H.R. 1256, Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which was signed into law on June 22, 2009. The Contractor will provide scientific support necessary to assist in the implementation of this law under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Specifically, the contractor will assist FDA by evaluating the pharmacologic properties and safety of tobacco products. The manufacturers of some of the emerging tobacco products (dissolvable tobacco products, e-cigarettes, little cigars, hookahs, etc.) have direct or implied claims that their health risks are less than those of traditional cigarettes. These potentially modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) have been on the market for too short a time for assessment of the validity of these claims. Since the tobacco products are not regulated as drugs, their pharmacologic and harmful effects have not been evaluated by FDA.</p>
<p>An in-house literature review of the clinical and clinical pharmacology information for a one of the new tobacco products (dissolvable in the mouth) revealed that this information is very sparse. In fact, none of the clinical studies of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the dissolvable tobacco products was prospectively designed (i.e. used an appropriate population of people; adequate sample size; assessed several meaningful biomarkers of exposure and response during the adequate length of time post-dose). There is no clear picture of the absorption, distribution and elimination of nicotine, its pharmacologically active derivatives after the administration of the dissolvable tobacco lozenges, pellets, and/or strips. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics and harmful effect of toxic compounds found in tobacco, such as nitrosamines, polyunsaturated and/or fluorinated hydrocarbons, heavy metals and volatile compounds in human biologic fluids, are not properly characterized for DTPs. The relationship between the biomarkers of exposure and response are not established for DTPs.</p>
<p>The dissolvable tobacco lozenges are composed from the milled tobacco leafs and several ingredients with the functions of binding, protection of degradation, coating, taste making and flavoring. Together with the other flavors (cinnamon, vanilla, etc.) some products contain menthol as a direct addition as well as a part of the natural products (i.e. peppermint) extracts. Since it is well known that menthol in general influences the buccal absorption, it is important to evaluate the effect of menthol on absorption of nicotine and other components of the dissolvable tobacco products, including nitrosamines.</p>
<p>The Office of Science Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), therefore, plans to initiate a series of clinical pharmacology studies of the tobacco products. The first pilot study will be performed with the dissolvable tobacco products (DTPs), followed by full size studies of DTPs, e-cigarettes, little cigars, and hookahs. The information acquired in these studies will fill the gap of knowledge of clinical pharmacology of these products.</p>
<p>The primary objectives of this IDIQ contract are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nicotine, its metabolites, as well as tobacco specific toxic compounds after the administration of the tobacco products (dissolvable tobacco products, e-cigarettes, little cigars, hookahs) and to compare the bioavailability of nicotine after administration of these tobacco products with the conventional cigarettes and to evaluate effect of menthol additive in some of these products on the nicotine pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill these tasks, the Government is proposing to perform a series of clinical pharmacology studies.</p>
<p>For each task, the constractor shall screen and select participants, administer the tobacco products, collect data and perform data analyses, which includes but is not limited to, subject evaluation, laboratory tests, computer-assisted-self-administered interviewing, specimen collection, assay of the specified compounds in human blood and urine, non-compartmental pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data analyses. Data collected under this mechanism will inform FDA on the nature and the impact of the use of dissolvable tobacco products on the public health which will have an impact on policies and regulations with respect to the dissolvable tobacco products, as well as risk communications regarding the use of tobacco products.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>Contractor tasks shall include, but not be limited to:</p>

<SUBJECT>Experimental Study on the Subjective, Physiological and Puff Topography Measures of Little Cigars
<SOLNBR>SSNDecember212011
<RESPDATE>010512
<CONTACT>Ann G. Argaman, Phone 3018276758, Email Ann.Argaman@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>TITLE: Experimental Study on the Subjective, Physiological and Puff Topography Measures of Little Cigars<br />OPDIV : FDA, Center for Tobacco Products (CTP)
<p>Background: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) in accordance with FAR 7.104(d). The potential small business will need to demonstrate the capability to perform all facets of the experimental study on the subjective, physiological and puff topography measures from initiation and conduct of the study through the data analyses phase and preparation of the final reports.</p>
<p>History: Tobacco products are responsible for more than 440,000 deaths each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that every day in the United States, approximately 3,900 young people between these ages of 12 and 17 smoke their first cigarette and approximately 1,000 adolescents become daily smokers. Flavored cigars are a novel class of tobacco products, which resemble cigarettes in size, packing and nicotine levels. Because some of these products taste like candy and are highly flavored, public health officials have raised concerns that flavored cigar tobacco products may be particularly appealing to children and adolescents. On June 22, 2009, the President signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (the Tobacco Control Act) into law. The Tobacco Control Act granted FDA important new authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health generally and to reduce tobacco use by minors.</p>
<p>FDA is specifically interested in understanding information relating to section 907(a)(3)(B)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, &amp; Cosmetic Act the following topics:</p>
<p>I. the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of tobacco products, of the proposed standard;</p>
<p>II. the increased or decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products;</p>
<p>III. the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using such products.</p>
<p>Data on flavored cigars will be critical to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee in studying and reporting on their public health impact. FDA is interested in this data for understanding the risks to children and adolescents, how the risks of using these products are perceived by smokers and non-smokers, and how use of these products affects health. Such research may include, but is not limited to the following topics:</p>
<p>&bull; puff topography<br />&bull; physiological measures<br />&bull; subjective measures<br />&bull; exploring perceptions</p>
<p><br />The tobacco industry has been charged with introducing flavored cigarettes in an attempt to appeal to new smokers (Connolly, 2004; Lews &amp; Wackowski, 2006). Younger smokers are more open to unique and exotic flavors than their older counterparts (Carpenter et al., 2005). The work of Klein et al. (2008) supports this with data supporting overall use of any of flavored brands in the past 30 days being 11.9% among smokers aged 17-26 years and 6.7% among smokers aged &gt; or =25 years. In addition, high sensation-seeking adolescents have more favorable attitudes and greater intentions of trial for brands with flavor versus more traditional brands (Manning et al., 2009).<br />On September 22, 2009 a ban on cigarettes containing certain characterizing flavors went into effect. The ban, authorized by the new Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, is part of a national effort by FDA to reduce smoking in America. FDA's ban on certain characterizing flavored cigarettes highlighted the importance of reducing the number of children who started to smoke, and who became addicted to dangerous tobacco products. FDA is also examining options for flavored tobacco products other than cigarettes.<br />According to section 907(a)(1)(A) of the Act: <br />...a cigarette or any of its component parts (including the tobacco, filter, or paper) shall not contain, as a constituent (including a smoke constituent) or additive, an artificial or natural flavor (other than tobacco or menthol) or an herb or spice, including strawberry, grape, orange, clove, cinnamon, pineapple, vanilla, coconut, licorice, cocoa, chocolate, cherry, or coffee, that is a characterizing flavor of the tobacco product or tobacco smoke.<br />In addition, section 900(3) defines cigarettes as:<br />(3) CIGARETTE.-The term &lsquo;cigarette'-<br />(A) means a product that-<br />(i) is a tobacco product; and<br />(ii) meets the definition of the term &lsquo;cigarette' in section 3(1) of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act; and<br />(B) includes tobacco, in any form, that is functional in the product, which, because of its appearance, the type of tobacco used in the filler, or its packaging and labeling, is likely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as a cigarette or as roll-your-own tobacco.<br /><br />The primary objectives of this contract are to conduct a study to assess if flavored little cigars, because of their appearance or type of tobacco used in the filler, are likely to be depicted as and consumed by tobacco users as a cigarette.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill these objectives, the Government is seeking a contractor to conduct an experimental study to measure the subjective physiological and puff topography measures, and perception, of flavored little cigars. The FDA shall provide the Contractor a draft protocol and questionnaire to aid the experiment. The Contractor, in collaboration with FDA and through ongoing communication, shall further develop and refine the protocol and questionnaire. The study design should allow for measurement of consumer's ability to perceive differences in tobacco products.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>Contractor tasks shall include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>2.1.2. Screening</p>
<p>The FDA will supply the Contractor with specific recruitment requirements, including a screening questionnaire, to meet the study objectives. The Contractor shall provide the facility, equipment, supplies and recruitment for a total of 48 completed subjects of adult White and African American male and female smokers. The Contractor shall also provide qualified personnel to conduct the screening and study. Experimental sessions will take approximately 90 minutes and the set of four (4) will be conducted at least 24 hours apart after a period of overnight tobacco abstinence.</p>
<p>Experimental sessions shall be conducted at IRB approved sites. The experimental sessions will be monitored by the Contractor and the COTR.</p>
<p>2.1.3. Recruitment and Study Population:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the required personnel to perform the identified tasks in this scope of work. The Contractor shall provide the required personnel, materials and services, and otherwise meet all requirements for, or incident to, the performance of the work as described below.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for recruiting the subjects.</p>
<p>The subjects should include cigarette smokers with no smokeless tobacco or cigar smoking experience during the past year. The subjects should be healthy males &amp; females 18-55 years of age. Women who are pregnant (as verified by a urine pregnancy test) or breastfeeding should be excluded. The subjects should be ethnically diverse, preferably 12 African American males, 12 African American females, 12 White Males and 12 White Females.</p>
<p>The estimated sample size is 48 (n=12 per cell) divided into the following subgroups:</p>
<p>African American Male African American Female White Male White Female<br />Cigarette Smoker n=12 n=12 n=12 n=12</p>
<p>2.1.4. Data Collection:</p>
<p>The contractor shall maintain detailed scientific notes and records from the research study. The contractor shall systematically and comprehensively analyze the data from the research study. The contractor shall analyze the data, synthesize the results, write a report summarizing the analysis, prepare presentation materials, and provide presentations of research results.</p>
<p>2.1.5. Methodology Report and Data Analyses:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the FDA with a methodology report including monitoring, sample selection procedures, data collection procedures, data preparation and processing, coding procedures, and any common themes or problems encountered during the execution of the study. The report should also include a summary of the results, including a subgroup analysis of the groups according to age, smoking status, SES, and education level. A preliminary draft of the final report should be sent to the FDA for review and comment prior to submitting the final report. FDA will provide feed back within 14 days.</p>
<p>2.1.6. Information Collection Request (ICR) and Human Subjects Protection:</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY - Using Filter Banks for Multi-Carrier Spread Spectrum Signals</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by the Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license, develop, and commercialize new methods for the wireless transmission of spread-spectrum signals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>License rights may be issued on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>INL may also be available to partner(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a Work for Others agreement or CRADA program.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Background:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dramatic rise of wireless devices and applications has sparked a new national need among commercial service providers, federal users and original equipment manufacturers to develop new spectrum agile technologies that utilize the radio spectrum intelligently while allowing seamless connectivity between different wide-area networks and, also localized mobile ad-hoc networks. Radios that are spectrum-aware, spectrum-agile and operate over a large spectral band are needed to serve the future public safety, military and commercial communication needs.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Description:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>INL is offering a new technology to address this specific need through intelligent detection and innovative generation of multi-carrier spread-spectrum signals using filter banks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) and frequency hopping spread spectrum (FH-SS) techniques are widely used to implement jam-resistant communication systems. Multi-carrier spread spectrum systems have been suggested; however, their implementation as of this date has been limited.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technology implemented by INL is significantly more robust against narrow-band and partial-band interference/jamming than the more popular DS-SS and FH-SS techniques. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It can be used as a stand-alone spread spectrum system with robust performance in narrow/partial band interference channels or as an underlay control channel in next generation cognitive radio networks and applications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This INL technology has a number of potential applications, including adoption by public safety, national defense and commercial cellular industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, this technology offers the following potential advantages over existing technologies:</p>

<p><span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line; FONT-FAMILY: 'Helv', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black">BEA has developed a process for making continuous micron diameter alpha silicon carbide (SiC) material directly in a fiber form starting from a carbon fiber substrate. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Using controlled process conditions of temperature, gaseous atmosphere and form of the carbon fiber substrate, BEA can produce an alpha SiC fiber. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Continuous carbon fibers can be drawn through a furnace containing a controlled heating, reaction and atmosphere zone. Fully converted SiC filaments have a narrow hollow core which can increase overall the fiber mechanical strength and partially converted fibers will have a SiC outer layer over a carbon core fiber. The fiber will retain strength during the conversion, thus making the process suited to continuous processing and low fabrication cost. This novel process for making a unique form of alpha SiC fiber is not available commercially today.</span></p>

<p><span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line; FONT-FAMILY: 'Helv', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black">BEA has developed a process for making a novel multi-layered metal - ceramic tube having a thin inner layer of zirconium metal alloy with an external ceramic matrix composite (CMC) layer made from continuous silicon carbide fibers with a matrix of silicon carbide ceramic. A thin central inner metallic layer enables hermetic gas tight sealing. At the tube ends a thick metallic wall provides area for end cap welding. The outer fiber reinforced CMC layer provides additional strength to the inner metallic layer and mechanical, environmental and high temperature protection to the inner metallic layer. The novel metal-ceramic tube is particularly seen as a containment vessel for nuclear fuel as used on a nuclear power plant or other similar reactor. The assembled layered tube has an engineered combination of thermal and mechanical features that uniquely result from the combination of metallic and ceramic layers. The inner metallic layer insures hermetic sealing of containment of gases and fuel within the tube and provides for conventional end cap sealing. The outer fiber reinforced ceramic layer imparts additional mechanical strength, stiffness, thermal shock resistance and high temperature load carrying capability above of the inner metallic liner alone. This novel metal- ceramic engineered approach will increase the lifetime and significantly increase the off normal safety margins as compared to current all zirconium alloy metal fuel tubes.</span></p>

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. NO SOLICITATION EXISTS. 
This advertisement serves to aid in determining market interest and capabilities for this prospective requirement. 

The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Jacksonville (FLCJ) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of contractors capable of providing specialized coatings to the J52-P-408B Turbojet engine components for the Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE), Jacksonville, FL. The purpose of these specialized coatings is to improve gas path airflow through the compressor/diffuser sections of the engine and provide corrosion protection for these coated parts. The J52-P-408B Turbojet engine powers the Navy/Marine Corps EA6B Prowler attack aircraft.
   The Prowlers primary mission is to provide electronic countermeasures protection for US and Allied aircraft during offensive air strikes. Currently the FRCSE is using PWA 110-21 coating, which is a Basecoat/Topcoat process, using a PWA 595-1 (SermeTel 962 basecoat), and PWA 561-1 (SermaSeal 565 TCS topcoat).  

It is anticipated that any resulting requirement would be solicited as a firm-fixed-price (FFP), requirements type contract, with a NAICS code of 332812 and size standard of 500 employees.  If your company is interested in competing for future requirements, perspective vendors are encouraged to submit a SAR package in accordance with the Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group Aviation Critical Safety Item Management Handbook of 16 Mar 2011, and Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group Aviation Source Approval and Management Handbook of 16 Mar 2011, for approval; or provide proof that they are an approved source of supply within the requirements of the above manuals in order for the Government to make an adequate assessment of the contractor capabilities.
  In addition, vendors should provide their business size as well as a point of contact.  The response date and time for all technical documentation is 18 January 2012, at 12:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  The Government will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the request for information. Interested parties should send all technical packages via email to oulay.vorachack@navy.mil, Contract Specialist.

If the contractor is currently providing or has previously provided identical support to a government agency other than FRCSE, then the contractor shall provide sufficient documentation, as part of the contractors package, which will allow the Government to verify the contractors information and determine the contractors ability to provide the required support.
  Any questions regarding this requirement should be addressed in writing to the Contract Specialist.

NOTE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. NO REIMBURESEMNT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING A RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST.  ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Program Executive Office - Mission Assurance and Network Operations (PEO-MA), is conducting this Request for Information (RFI) as market research to determine sources with competencies to provide solutions/capabilities for Host Based Security System requirements.
<p>The Government would like to identify central management solutions for host based security tools that provide open Application Programming Interfaces (API) as well as host based security solutions capable of interfacing with said management system.  The ideal Central Management Framework (CMF) would be one that allows for management of any set of host based security tools regardless of the entities that developed each one. The intent is for a multi-phase acquisition focused first on a CMF that will provide an open architecture based on standards for integration, and then proceed with follow-on acquisitions adapting best of breed host-based security products for integration into this framework.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this RFI are due NLT 23 January 2012, at 8:00 AM (CST) and shall be submitted to PEO_IANACQUISITION@disa.mil. Contact Martha Jasper with any applicable questions at Martha.Jasper@disa.mil, or telephone number 301-225-8577.</p>

FAR 6.302-2(a)(2) When the agency's need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.
FAR 6.302-2(b) This authority applies in those situations where- 
(1) An unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition; and 
(2) Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.

<DESC>The Deputy Administrator for Commodity Operations is transitioning to a performance-based approach for procurement of all packaging supplies and materials. This requirement of the Federal Acquisition Regulation supports the international food aid programs through open and fair competition. Contracting information utilizing specific packaging construction will ultimately be phased out of use as performance standards come to the forefront of packaging materials sourcing. <br />
<p><br />Vendors will remain responsible to ensure use of proper packaging (e.g. does not leak or tear, withstands multiple and rough handlings without spillage). The purpose of any upcoming changes is to increase the competitiveness of commodity bids while maintaining packaging functionality and program integrity.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this notice may be directed to Bradley Hoppe at (202) 720-0956, to the Commodity Operations Division at (202) 720-2121, or via e-mail at Brad.Hoppe@wdc.usda.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) intends to award a fixed priced contract using only one responsible source, The GEO, Group, Incorporated (GEO), as an authorized user under the established ICE Contract for Aurora County Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado to house persons in custody of the United States Marshals Service (USMS). These comprehensive detention services will serve a population principally consisting of individuals charged with federal offenses and detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, a hearing on immigration status, or deportation. Contract performance requires the management and operation of a Contractor-owned/Contractor-operated detention facility for federal detainees. The population will be individuals charged with federal offenses and detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, a hearing on their immigration status, or deportation. OFDT will award a contract that allows the USMS, to house prisoners at the facility. The facility shall be provided to accommodate at least 200 USMS prisoners at a single site and be located within the geographic and political boundaries of the federal courthouse located at Byron G. Rogers United States Courthouse and Federal Building, 1929 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado 80294. The facility shall be located within appropriate proximity and access to emergency services (medical, fire protection, law enforcement, etc.). The government intends on awarding a Fixed-Price contract type for, all necessary personnel, equipment, materials, supplies, and services do all things necessary for, or incident to, the management and operation of comprehensive detention services.
<p>No other existing facility is in place for this procurement action, competition would require construction of a new facility. New Construction would require a study of the potential environmental impacts, proposed mitigation, and any other relevant information pertaining to the impacts of the construction and operation of the proposed facility. Greater consideration would be given to the offer which represents the environmentally preferable alternative. Environmentally preferable alternative means, the proposal that has a lesser or reduced negative effect on the human environment when compared with competing proposals. An existing facility would have less effect or no effect on the environment. Non-Federal Detention bed space for federal detainees is acquired through Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs), where a daily rate is paid to State and local governments. If an Intergovernmental Agreement is not available, a facility specific contract is established with a private service provider. To help overcome some of the challenges and to control costs in acquiring non-federal detention services, the Department of Justice Appropriations Act for 2001 (Public Law 106-553) contained the following provision: Sec. 119; Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including section 4(d) of the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 353(d)), the Attorney General hereafter may enter into contracts and other agreements, of any reasonable duration, for detention or incarceration space or facilities, including related services, on any reasonable basis. This authority is designed to allow for the use of non-traditional contract vehicles when acquiring detention and other related services. Section 119 grants the Attorney General the authority to enter into contracts of any reasonable duration, for detention or incarceration space or facilities, including related services, on any reasonable basis. The concluding phrase on any reasonable basis is interpreted within the ordinary meaning to encompass all pertinent terms and conditions, which would be reasonable to include in a justified non-competitive basis. Any interested party in this action may submit questions to Deborah M. Johnson at Deborah.Johnson3@usdoj.gov , no later&nbsp;January 16, 2012.</p>

The requested purchase order assists in meeting USACE objectives to perform slope stability, groundwater seepage, and stress-deformation analysis.  The analysis is used in the design for dams, levees, and reinforced walls.  These programs are often used in private industry and obtaining them will allow USACE to properly review the work of A/E design firms.

<CONTACT>Lisa Wells, 301-619-2086

<a href="mailto:lisa.lynn.wells@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed-price award modification on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1).  Modification will be issued to the existing contract with the American Registry of Pathology (ARP), P.O. Box 10008, Rockville, MD  20849.  Modification is for continued professional support services to the National Museum of Health and Medicine (NMHM), U.S. Army Garrison-Forest Glen, Silver Spring, MD 20910.  The proposed modification will add 5 months to an initial 3 months of support services to NMHM.  The total contract duration for ARP services will become 8 months ending in May 2012.  The modification will bridge the existing contract to a planned competitive award for a base plus option years.  ARP, by virtue of being the incumbent contractor, is the only responsible source for the bridge modification to extend the current contract. The execution of the bridge modification will prevent any potential adverse impact to the mission of the NMHM, which would occur in the event of interruption or disruption of the work presently being performed. <br><br>The modification requirement is for non-personal services to be extended on ARP's contract W81XWH-11-C-0495.  The initial contract was issued to bridge professional and administrative support to NMHM on a sole source basis through December 31, 2011.  The additional support to be provided via award modification is required to continue adequate professional and administrative museum-unique staffing to support the NMHM at an acceptable operational level.  As transition operations continue from the mandated Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) project, ARP staff and expertise is required to continue from, or complete, projects that are underway.   The modification value is $786,633.39 with an award value of $1,327,007.17 over the entire 8 month period.  <br><br>The incumbent ARP provides highly trained museum support staff to NMHM.  To attempt to do a stop-gap short-term competitive contract to cover the requirements pending the award of follow-on contract is not feasible because the three-tiered transition (from incumbent to short-term contractor to follow-on contractor) within a span 5 months would potentially disrupt the acceptable operational level of support required to carry out the mission of the NMHM.  The statement of work under the bridge modification is to remain substantially the same as under the current ARP contract. <br><br>This is a notice of intent to award a bridge modification under the current contract and is not a request for quotes or proposals and no solicitation is forthcoming. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than December 28, 2011 by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time to Ms. Tonya Kreps, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at tonya.kreps@amedd.army.mil.  Responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and would not hinder mission objectives of the NMHM Program Management Office.<br><br>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. This notice in no way obligates the Government to award any bridge modifications to the existing contract. Any questions or concerns with regard to the Government's intent to sole source this bridge modification shall sent by email to tonya.kreps@amedd.army.mil, no later than December 28, 2011 by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time.  <br><br>This document sets forth the justification and approval for an exception to full and open competition allowed under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) and FAR 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Execution of the bridge modification will prevent any adverse impact to the mission of the NMHM, which would occur with the interruption/disruption of the work presently performed.  <br><br>The support services provided under this modification and the initial award have been performed by ARP for the past 15 years, primarily through cost reimbursement type contracts under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5) and 10 U.S.C. 176(b)(1)(C), as implemented by FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.  The authority expired in September 2011 due to the disestablishment of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Law 2005 directed the relocation of NMHM from Walter Reed to Forest Glen Annex, Silver Spring, MD.  Therefore, the requirement for ARP to provide its expertise and support services to the Army remains, only in a reduced capacity until a long term competitive award is issued.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:

The Cherry Point Satellite Contract Office, Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Cherry Point, NC 28533 hereby gives notice of their intent to award a purchase order to Oxford Instruments America, Inc., 300 Baker Ave, Ste 150, Concord, MA 01742-2204, (Cage Code: 1EPT2) on a sole source basis in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East, MCAS Cherry Point, NC has a requirement to establish a contract for maintenance for the Oxford Energy Dispersive X-Ray system and the Spectrometer X-Ray for one year.
  Market research has revealed this contractor is the only source capable of providing the required items.  Therefore, the government intends to procure these services on a sole source basis from Oxford Instruments America, Inc., the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the machine.  

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. However, all quotes received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered. Interested parties may identify their interest and unique capabilities to respond to this requirement or submit their quote. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Point of contacts for this requirement is Larry Davis, 252.466.7765 larry.davis1@usmc.mil or Sherry Kelly, 252.466.2846, sherry.kelly@usmc.mil.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command Quantico, Virginia intends to modify existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity combination type, contract M67854-05-D-6014 Expeditionary Fire Support Systems/Internally Transportable Vehicle (EFSS/ITV) with  General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems  Large Caliber Ammunition (GD-OTS LCA), 11399 16th Court North, St. Petersburg, FL 33716 on a sole source basis in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This intent is subject to final approval in accordance with FAR 6.304.

The proposed contract action extends the period of performance, under the existing contract logistics support order, from March 31, 2012 to June 30, 2012.
  This extension will further allow for the current follow-on competitive procurement to be accomplished and to allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor to occur in a timeframe that will not impact imminent logistics support activities.  To that effect additional work will be added; to support an imminent fielding event,  incorporate revisions to production items and technical manuals as a result of  engineering change proposals,  continue provisioning effort and to allow repairs to be made to GFM. The estimated increase to the contract value is approximately $3M. GD-OTS LCA is the only responsible source for the effort as the Government would incur unacceptable delays and costs in fulfilling the agencys requirements if this extension was not exercised before the current contract expiration date.
 

This notice to extend contract services is not a request for competitive proposals. The extended period of performance of the contract is three (3) months. This extension of services was limited to the least amount of time necessary to obtain full and open competition as soon as possible. A determination not to compete this proposed contract extension is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

The point of contact for this acquisition is Contract Specialist, Larry Gillman; Email, larry.gillman@usmc.mil. Phone calls will not be accepted.

*All quotes shall include shipping FOB Destination  Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, NY EVALUATION CRITERIA In accordance with FAR 15.101-2, the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process will be used.  The best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.  The evaluation factors and significant sub factors established below are the requirements of acceptability, and award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.  These factors and sub factors represent the key areas of importance and emphasize areas to be considered in the source selection decision.  Tradeoffs are not permitted and proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors.
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 	Technical capability of the item offered	Price  	Delivery Approach/Schedule. 
For evaluation purposes, the relative order of importance is as follows:	Technical is more important than Price	Price is more important than Delivery Approach/Schedule. 	When assessed together Technical and Price are significantly more important than Delivery Approach/Schedule.
Technical: The offerors shall submit their proposed technical proposal describing how the approach will meet the requirements of the Delivery Order.  The offerors shall provide an integrated scope of technical specifications for the proposed model which should include all requirements to satisfy the required delivery order. That is, the government will evaluate offers for award purposes by total price for all requirements.    
The government will assess the degree to which the offerors technical approach demonstrates sound engineering practices a, proper management oversight to successfully meet the accomplishment of equipment objectives. The following adjectival rating will be utilized in the evaluation of the technical proposal Approach:  
RATING:  TECHNICAL	EVALUATION CRITERIA

Low Risk	Little doubt exists, based on the Offerors written proposal, that the Offerors proposed item will meet the technical requirements.
Moderate Risk	Some doubt exists, based on the Offerors written proposal, that the Offerors proposed item will meet the technical requirements.
High Risk	Significant doubt exists, based on the Offerors written proposal, that the Offerors proposed item will meet the technical requirements.Unknown Risk	Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.
Price: Price Analysis will be performed. Price analysis shall be used when certified cost or pricing data are not required, and as this is a commercially available requirement.  Price data will be evaluated for magnitude and reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.404-1 (b) and will be adjusted from both a technical and cost perspective using cost realism analysis to determine the most probable cost to the Government. The most probable cost will be used in the decision process to assess the realism and efficiency of the offerors proposed delivery schedule approach and to establish which offerors approach represents the best value to the Government for award of the Delivery Order.
 Price Inconsistencies: Any significant performance and price inconsistencies, if unexplained in the offerors proposal, raise a fundamental issue of the offerors understanding of the nature and scope of work required and their financial ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.
Delivery/Schedule Approach:   This assessment will focus on the probability of successful accomplishment of delivery of similar equipment to industrial facilities as required in the Scope of Work. A rating of Low, Moderate, High or Unknown (as defined below) will be assigned to the Performance Risk Factor as follows:

RATING:  Delivery/Schedule Approach	EVALUATION CRITERIA
Low Risk	Little doubt exists that the Offeror can deliver the item in 10 weeks from contract award or less. Moderate Risk	Some doubt exists that the Offeror can deliver the item in 10 weeks from contract award or less. High Risk	Significant doubt exists that the Offeror can deliver the item in 10 weeks from contract award or less. Unknown Risk	Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.
In accordance FAR 15.306, the government reserves the right to award without discussions.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>Solicitation Number: W91WAW-12-R-0013 Notice Type:  Combined Synopsis/Solicitation <br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br><br>The solicitation number is W91WAW-12-R-0013 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). Under this requirement, the Army Contracting Command--National Contract Region (ACC-NCR) intends to award a commercial, firm fixed price contract.<br>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-54. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code is 541511. The small business size standard is $25M. This acquisition is a Small Business 100% Set Aside. ACC-NCR intends to purchase a full range of contractor support services for the Army Joint Annual Exercise (AJAX) Management Information System (MIS).  The purpose of this effort is to obtain personnel, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to provide technical support for the AJAX MIS and Analytical Support for Army Participation in the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Exercise Program and Joint Training as described in the attached PWS. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation. <br><br>The period of performance shall be for one Base year of 12 months and two 12- month options periods.  The period of performance is anticipated to be:  <br>	Base Period		            02 February 2012 - 01 February 2013<br>	Option Period One 		02 February 2013 - 01 February 2014<br>	Option Period Two		02 February 2014 - 01 February 2015<br>The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and paragraph (a) is completed as follows: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br><br>Factor I. Technical: <br><br>Subfactor 1:  Understanding of the requirement.  The offeror's proposal will be evaluated to include the extent to which it demonstrates a sound understanding of the PWS requirements, provides a comprehensive approach to meeting the PWS requirements, identifies the risks in performance and describes the plan to successfully mitigate the risks.  The proposal shall demonstrate the offeror's qualifications and experience in those areas that are relevant to the tasks described in the PWS.  The offeror shall have sufficient fiscal and management resources on hand and available to begin and sustain work on the effort.  The Quality Control Program will be evaluated for soundness and a reflection of a thorough understanding of the PWS.  <br>Subfactor 2:  Personnel: The qualifications demonstrated in the resumes will be evaluated to determine whether the education and experience requirements have been met; whether the qualifications are relevant to the specific PWS task areas; and whether they have the ability to successfully perform the functions associated with a contract of this scale and scope. The qualifications of the key personnel set forth in the proposal will be evaluated as to their relevancy to this effort and have specific experience relative to the PWS task areas.  <br><br><br>Factor II. Past Performance:  Past performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the contractor's relevant past performance record on similar federal, state, local and commercial contracts.  When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its inquiry on past performance of the offeror under existing and prior contracts over the past three (3) years as it relates to all solicitation requirements.  The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and currency of the offeror's past performance as it relates to the quality of the service, schedule, business relations, management of key personnel, compliance with security requirements, cost management/performance, and in successfully accomplishing the required effort.  Quality of performance is defined as the level of past performance provided which will be used as an indicator of the offeror's likelihood of success.  Relevancy is defined as the scope, magnitude, complexity, and similarity of offeror's past performance as it relates to this acquisition.  <br><br>A significant achievement, problem, or lack of relevant data in any element of the work can become an important consideration in the source selection process.  Adverse Past Performance may result in an overall high-risk rating.  Therefore, offerors are reminded to include all relevant past efforts, including demonstrated corrective actions, in their proposal.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  An "unknown risk" factor will be given.<br><br>Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources.  Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offeror to explain the relevance of the data provided.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing relevant past performance rests with the offerors. The offer will be evaluated on the size, scope, and responsibility of the offeror in engagements relevant to the requirement in the PWS.  The Government will evaluate overall satisfaction through information submitted by the Past Performance references.<br><br>Factor III. Price:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices.  FAR clause 52.217-8 will be included in the resulting contract.  In order to evaluate this option price, the Government will include in the total evaluated price an amount equal to half of the price proposed by the offeror for the base period.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2).  No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.<br><br><br>The Technical Approach (Factor I) including subfactors and Past Performance (Factor II) will be evaluated using adjectival ratings. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate the Price (Factor III). For evaluation purposes, Technical Approach is significantly more important than Past Performance, and Past Performance is significantly more important than Price. Technical Approach and Past Performance when combined are significantly more important than Price.  All sub-factors are listed in order of importance. To receive consideration for award, a rating has to be no less than "Acceptable" and has to be achieved for the Technical Approach factor and Sub-Factors. The degree of importance of cost as a factor will become greater depending upon the equality of the proposals for other factors evaluated. In the event that competing proposals are determined to be technically substantially equal, the total price will become the dominant factor.<br><br>The following adjectival rating scales will be used to assess the offerors non-priced factors. The first scale is used for Technical Approach while the second scale is used for Past Performance.<br>Factor I including Subfactor 1 - 2 will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale <br> <br>  Technical Rating<br>Color	Rating	Description<br><br>Blue	  Outstanding	   Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies.<br><br>Purple	   Good	     Proposal meets requirements and indicates thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal contains at least one strength and no deficiencies. <br><br>Green	   Acceptable	   Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal has no strengths or deficiencies.<br><br>Yellow   	Marginal	 Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.<br><br>Red	  Unacceptable	     Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies and is unawardable.<br><br><br>Factor II will be evaluated using the following Past Performance Relevancy Rating <br> <br>Rating	Definition<br><br>Very Relevant	    Present/past performance effort involved, essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br><br>Relevant	  Present/past performance effort involved, similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitations requires.<br><br>Somewhat Relevant	    Present/past performance effort involved, some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br><br>Not Relevant	     Present/past performance effort inolved, little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitations requires.<br><br><br>Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Alt 1 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items, Alternate I with their proposal (Full text of this clause starts on page 8).

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation. Please reference solicitation number HSTS07-12-R-00014 on all correspondence.</p>

<p>This combined solicitation/synopsis is for the purchase of range services on an established/ existing range. NOTE: THE RANGE MUST BE AN ESTABLSIHED RANGE; THIS IS NOT A REQUEST TO BUILD A RANGE.<br /><br />The proposed range must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:</p>

The range time must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the hours indicated. <br />The range must be able to accommodate 24-30 shooters a day.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen," serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s). As OTI carries out more assessments, provides more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitates earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide assistance and expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Transition Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Transition Advisor requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The OTI Transition Advisor is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Transition Advisor is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The OTI Transition Advisor has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The OTI Transition Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD) or his/her designee, the Transition Advisor will:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in the field and in Washington, DC, including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups, ongoing OTI country programs and on-call technical assistance;</p>
<p>&bull; In collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, participate in assessments for possible new country programs and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI Country team with new country start-ups, or provide support while the OTI Country Representative or Deputy Country Representative is on leave or when OTI has not determined the length of a new country program, but is required to have a presence on the ground;</p>
<p>&bull; Support, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI Country Team in determining program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in conceptualizing and designing country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull; When required by the OTI Country team, represent OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI team in identifying or seeking out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems and in providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull; Review program budgets and propose changes and adjustments and draft any written justifications that will assist in securing quick approvals;</p>
<p>&bull; In collaboration with the OTI Country team, update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, serve as a liaison with other Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) offices, other USAID divisions and the U.S. Department of State on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to help ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The OTI Transition Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the OTI Country Representative when in the field.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Intermittent, Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Sr. Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor, Worldwide position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>

<p>&bull; Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a liaison with other Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee, program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;<br />&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>***************<br />This solicitation is amended to change the contract type to a Blanket Purchase Agreement and to extend the deadline for responses to Tuesday, December 27, 2011.
<p>Because the local Texas market for hay and livestock feed is currently affected by a severe draught, a 5-year fixed-price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract is not a preferred contract type for most suppliers. The contract type resulting from this solicitation is changed to a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) with firm fixed pricing valid for intervals of at least 6 months. Depending on future market conditions hay and livestock feed, the BPA pricing will potentially get re-negotiated (up or down) at 6-month intervals per the agreement of both parties to keep the BPA in place for up to 5 years. The BPA terms and conditions and the updated SF1449 are listed in Attachment 2. A price schedule valid for at least 6 months should be submitted by each offeror. The updated price schedule is listed in Addendum II.</p>
<p>The updated response deadline for quotations is pushed back to no later than 3:00 pm Central Time on Tuesday, _December 27, 2011_. Quotations shall be sent to USDA APHIS MRPBS-ASD Contracting Team, Attn: Michael Chiodi, Butler Square West 5th Floor, 100 North 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN 55403. Faxing or emailing quotes is acceptable. Mr. Chiodi may be reached by email at michael.j.chiodi@aphis.usda.gov, telephone (612) 336-3203, or fax (612) 336-3550.</p>

Some movements e.g. roll and yaw for the VFM and yaw for HFM, have been left out intentionally to increase the mechanical stability of the system. Any contractor interested in submitting a proposal shall follow these specifications and submit a proposal accordingly. However, following chapter 8 in the Statement of Work, the contractor is encouraged to make recommendations for changes that might lead to an improvement in performance. Therefore, if it is assumed that additional motions do not reduce the requested stability but improve the performance of the system, the contractor is encouraged to add this to the proposal as an option.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question: #2<br /></span></strong>In the technical spec 2.3.4.1 e., it is described that the distance between the downstream end of the High Resolution KB HFM and the outer wall of the vacuum vessel shall be less than 1 cm. Considering its UHV use, would it be possible to set it 15 mm to make sure the strength?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer: #2<br /></span></strong>The high resolution KB mirror set is aiming for a spatial resolution below 100nm. As a result, the working distance, i.e. the distance between the downstream end of the high resolution HFM and the sample is small, here, 40 mm. Taking into account the known sizes of motors necessary to move and rotate the sample through the focal spot of the KB mirrors, an open space of 30 mm is minimum. This results in the distance of 10 mm written in the technical specifications. As there is not much of a movement in Z-direction necessary for the high resolution HFM, most of this can go into the wall thickness of the vacuum vessel. No optical or mechanical component shall be connected to the vessel wall, therefore a flexing due to vacuum pressure will not harm the performance of the system. By keeping the volume of the vacuum vessel to its minimum necessary size, it is possible to give the body structure of the vessel an irregular shape, which then supports mechanical stability against vacuum pressure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question: #3<br /></span></strong>Would you have any specific limit for the distance between the upstream end of the High Resolution KB VFM and the outer wall of the vacuum vessel?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer: #3 <br /></span></strong>There is no specific limit for that distance.</p>

It is likely that this or another classified deployment will be a requirement of the follow-on contractor. The&nbsp;contractor must have, at day one of contract award, the ability to receive classified deployment information, prepare to negotiate the requirement, and get to the deployed location within the 120 day phase-in timeframe.</span></p>
<p>In regards to Facility Clearances (FCLs), Chapter 2-102 of the NISPOM establishes eligibility requirements a company must meet before it can be processed for an FCL. One requirement is that there has to be a need to access classified information in connection with a legitimate U.S. Government requirement. In the case of the C-21 requirement, access to classified information is not required for a company to SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. The Government is not in a position to remove the requirement to obtain an FCL prior to award because a contractor must have a FCL the day of award in order to carry out the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Even though there is a requirement to have a FCL prior to award, the Government cannot sponsor any contractors until there is a bona fide need for that contractor to access classified information for this C-21 CLS requirement. Take caution that if another contractor sponsors a company for an FCL for this C-21 effort, there are no guaranteed assurances that DSS will approve the FCL. Defense Security Services (agency responsible to the issuance of FCLs) have informed this agency that the FCL depends on a variety of circumstances such as completion of all FCL required paperwork, the identification of the company Key Management Personnel (KMP) who must obtain personnel clearances to the level of the FCL (if the KMP are uncleared this can take some time), FOCI mitigation, etc.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Questions and Answers<br /></span><span>Additional Questions and Answers are attached to this posting.<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE (1 Dec 11)<br /></strong></span><br />Due to a change in policies and procedures, the lead time to get Base Entry Approval has shortened.

Therefore, reducing water demand, by treating gray water and reclaiming potable water, is needed to reduce the number of convoys necessary to bring in potable water and remove gray water. Water logistics plays an increasing role at the tactical edge, where small FOBs are regularly distributed throughout remote regions. <br><br>Objective: Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for water recycle/reuse technology that will, at a minimum, improve the water efficiency at Platoon-sized (50 personnel) FOBs during expeditionary operations. The technologies used in the system shall be scalable such that a system that can support a Company-sized (150 personnel) FOB can be developed using the same technologies. <br><br>Period of Performance: The scope of this effort is such that we anticipate a potential duration of twenty-four (24) months (fiscal year 2012 to 2013).<br><br>Funding: The maximum government funding available in Fiscal Years 2012 through 2013 is $1.75M. The estimated maximum funding available for each fiscal year of the project is $1,280,000 in Fiscal Year 2012 and $470,000 in Fiscal Year 2013. Funds which are not expended in a given fiscal year are available in the subsequent years of the project, subject to fund type restrictions. <br><br>Multiple Awards: The Government anticipates awarding up to two (2) contracts as a result of this topic. <br><br>Potential offerors should access the full topic description, terms and conditions, and proposal submission instructions by clicking the link below or copying and pasting the following: <br>http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/05RBAA1.htm <br><br>Proposals that reflect a partial solution to the technical objective and description are not acceptable. The government will consider only those proposed projects that address all elements of the objective and description.<br><br>Proposals will be accepted 01 December 2011 through 23 January 2012. Proposals must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, 23 January 2012 using the ASFI Bid Response System (BRS), accessible at:<br>https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm <br>You will find Topic 25 for proposal submission by searching Contracting Opportunities for 'TARBAATOPIC25'

<DESC>Background: The current and future demands of a highly mobile, resource limited, Forward Operating Base (FOB) Camp call for new/advancements in technologies for wastewater treatment. The Government must continue to improve and optimize its water management to meet mission requirements. The need for reductions in the water supply burden of FOB operations and the safe discharge of wastewater require innovative technologies with the capability to treat gray (i.e., shower water reuse system concentrate) and black water (i.e., kitchen and toilet) so that it can be discharged into the environment, thus eliminating the need for waste hauling. <br><br>Objective: Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for a low-waste generation, energy efficient, gray and black wastewater treatment system that can, at a minimum, be used to support a Platoon-sized (50 personnel) FOB during expeditionary operations. The technologies used in the system shall be scalable such that a system that can support a Company-sized (150 personnel) FOB can be developed using the same technologies. <br><br>Period of Performance: The scope of this effort is such that we anticipate a potential duration of twenty-four (24) months (fiscal year 2012 to 2013). <br><br>Funding: The maximum government funding available in Fiscal Years 2012 through 2013 is $1.75M.

<DESC><strong>*****Please note: Deadline for submission has been extended to January 17, 2012.*****<br /><br /><br />PILOT TEST FOR EDI TRANSACTIONS OF STANDARDS ADOPTED UNDER HIPAA<br /><br /></strong>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified businesses that can provide development and implementation of a pilot to test transaction standards that have been or may be recommended for adoption to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), for mandatory use by health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).<br /><br /><strong>1.0 Background<br /><br /></strong>The original HIPAA legislation required the adoption of an initial set of standards for administrative and financial transactions between health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers. The transactions were for eligibility for a health plan, claims, claim payment, claim status, authorizations and referrals, enrollment in a health plan, and premium billing. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires adoption of additional and/or updated standards, as well as operating rules to support all adopted standard transactions.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Existing process for the adoption of standards (new or updated)<br /><br /></span></strong>1. Work groups within the Standards Development Organization (SDO) create or revise the implementation specification for each transaction in accordance with a regular schedule. Each updated version is voted on by various levels of work groups. Membership in the SDO is required for a vote, but each organization only gets one vote. <br />2. Updated and approved versions of the transaction standards are presented by the SDO to the Designated Standards Maintenance Organization (DSMO). The DSMO was named in the original HIPAA legislation in 2001, and is comprised of three SDOs and the code content committees. <br />3. The DSMO takes the updated and approved versions of the standards to the National Committee on Vital Health Statistics (NCVHS), suggesting that they recommend adoption. The NCVHS conducts industry hearings, presumably to obtain industry input on the new versions, and in turns makes a recommendation to the Secretary to adopt a standard or updated version of a standard.<br />4. The Secretary then publishes proposed and final rules to adopt the standard. Industry has two years in which to comply with the standard after publication of the final rule. For details on the adoption of the current set of transaction standards, visit the Regulations and Guidance page on the CMS website at www.cms.gov.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">History of standards adoption under HIPAA<br /><br /></span></strong>The regulations adopting the ASC X12 and NCPDP standards were first promulgated in 2001; the first compliance date was October 2003. The adopted versions were ASC X12 Version 4010 and NCPDP 5.1. In January 2009, HHS adopted updated versions of the two standards - ASC X12 Version 5010 and NCPDP D.0. Compliance is required by January 2012.. While both versions of the standards were adopted based on recommendations from the DSMO to NCVHS, and NCVHS to the Secretary, neither version was subjected to vigorous industry testing prior to adoption, and there were substantive implementation issues for X12 Version 4010, causing the need for addenda, followed by other issues for X12 Version 5010, which also resulted in addenda for several of the transactions. The need for the Version 5010 addenda is sometimes cited as responsible, in part, for the industry's delayed testing and implementation in the fall of 2011, necessitating another enforcement discretion policy for compliance with the standards. . In sum, HHS has adopted two versions of the X12 standards without any prior testing or validation; costing the private and public sector significant dollars. Again, in both cases, problems were identified with the transaction standards after they had been balloted by the SDO, recommended to the DSMO, to NCVHS, and then to the Secretary. These problems necessitated errata, addenda, a federal register notice outlining the problems and adopting a new sub version of the standard (4010A1), and most recently, the imposition of "enforcement discretion" for Version 5010 as a result of various technical issues identified late in the testing process. <br /><br />Within the next few years, HHS must adopt two new standards - one for electronic funds transfer (EFT) and one for electronic claims attachments. The EFT standard has been created by the financial services sector, and is maintained by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA). Interestingly, there has been little controversy with this standard in its current use across all industry sectors; but it has not yet been in wide spread or consistent use in the health care industry. The other new standard is for electronic claims attachments. <br /><br />Before any recommendations for adoption of new standards or new versions of transaction standards, there should be a formal process for piloting and/or testing them for usability and usefulness to industry. For example, if the SDO and/or DSMO intend to propose adoption of a new version of the X12 standard, e.g. Version 6020, there must be data available to prove that this version is viable and acceptable to industry prior to adoption. <br /><br /><strong>2.0 Requirements Overview and Operations<br /><br /></strong>The following provides potential responders with an overview of the types of support that would be required of the Pilot Test of Standards contractor. Note that although this is an extensive list, it is not meant to be all inclusive. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Scope<br /><br /></span></strong>The purpose of this project is to develop and execute a method of testing the updated versions of ASC X12 standard transactions before they are adopted under HIPAA and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We wish to confirm the functionality, usability, interoperability and business usage of the standard transactions for the following: Eligibility, Claims, Claim Payment, Authorization, and Claim Status. <br /><br />The Contractor shall also maintain system hardware and software capabilities to perform required EDI testing and validation of transactions and operating rules. <br />The deliverables for the pilot include the following activities, tasks, and documentation: <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timeline</span></strong></p>
<p>We would like to conduct the pilot over the course of one year. We anticipate the following types of activities and anticipate additional input from interested parties.</p>
<p><strong>Phase I: Detailed Gap Analysis <br /><br /></strong>1. Execution of gap analysis between new and old version of the standard<br />2. Identification of issues resulting from the gap analysis <br />3. Mapping of ASC X12 Version 5010 to Version 6020<br />4. Documentation of gaps and differences between ASC X12 Version 5010 to Version 6020<br />5. Documentation describing the strategy for testing the updated version and itemization of how issues will be documented when testing is conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Phase II: Development<br /><br /></strong>1. Design and development of translators to conduct the mapping of the updated fields and requirements in ASC X12 Version 6020<br />2. Documentation of the issues and challenges identified in the design and development process</p>
<p><strong>Phase III: Execution and Quality Assurance <br /><br /></strong>1. Documentation (user friendly, layperson terminology) of the gaps and barriers to use of each transaction in the new version<br />2. Recommendations for changes to the new version of the standard to accommodate industry business needs<br />3. Recommendations for changes to the standards development process <br />4. Recommendations for suggestions to improve the diversity of input to the standards development process</p>

<DESC>NEW Request for Further Information for the acquisition of pharmacy benefit management services under the Department of Defense (DoD) TRICARE Pharmacy Program (TPharm)
<p>December 21, 2011</p>
<p><br />The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is seeking further information and suggestion from the pharmacy industry for acquisition planning and development of a future solicitation to replace the current pharmacy benefit management service contract scheduled to conclude October 2014. Before proposals are solicited, TMA intends to release a draft Request for Proposals for industry comment, and also intends to provide potential offerors with historical data.</p>
<p>1. TMA is soliciting input on which reference pricing benchmark, Average Wholesale Price (AWP), Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC), or other alternative, should be included in the next generation pharmacy contract for reimbursement and/or financial incentive purposes. At a minimum this reference benchmark should be available electronically from a commercial third party source, it should cover the widest number of brand and generic drugs possible, and there should be some assurance it will continue to be published throughout the life of the next contract.</p>
<p>2. TMA is also soliciting input regarding the optimal duration of the next contract. Among other factors for consideration by the Government, the Government is particularly interested in encouraging participation by non-incumbents to maximize competition. Discussion of capital investment and market uncertainty is encouraged.</p>
<p>Capability statements, promotional material, or sales pitches are undesired. Responses by consultants or attorneys shall disclose themselves as such and describe or identify their client.</p>
<p>CONTACT INFORMATION<br />Following is the Point of Contact (POC) for this RFI:</p>

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />PREVIOUS REQUEST<br />Request for Information (RFI) for a Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition and Management of Services in Support of the TRICARE Pharmacy Program (TPharm4)
<p><br />INTRODUCTION <br />The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is conducting market research to determine current capabilities of commercial pharmacy benefit management (PBM) organizations that provide Home Delivery/Mail Order pharmacy (including specialty pharmacy) services, retail pharmacy network, claims adjudication, and fiscal intermediary functions. TMA is also seeking information from the pharmacy industry regarding how competition may best be achieved and minimize cost by capturing commercial best practices in the Government's objectives and requirements. Suggestions from industry will be considered; however the Government reserves the right to solicit for the required services in a manner of its choosing in accordance with applicable procurement regulations.</p>
<p>TMA is currently in the market research and requirements determination stage for the follow-on procurement to the current TRICARE Pharmacy contract which is scheduled to conclude October 2014, if all options are exercised. Before proposals are solicited, and schedule permitting, TMA intends to release a draft Request for Proposals for industry comment and also intends to provide potential offerors with historical data. Interested parties are encouraged to monitor Federal Business Opportunities at fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Responses are requested by 4:00 PM on October 31, 2011. Earlier responses are encouraged.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p>At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future Request For Proposals will not be entertained.</p>
<p>TRICARE OVERVIEW<br />The TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program falls under the Department of Defense (DoD) Military Health System (MHS) and TRICARE Program:</p>
<p>The medical mission of the DoD is to maintain readiness through health and medical services provided to the armed forces during military operations, and to provide health and medical services/support to the members of the armed forces, their family members and others entitled to the TRICARE benefit.</p>
<p>TRICARE is the DoD health care program administered by the TMA by means of the MHS for approximately 9.6 million active duty and retired members of the Uniformed Services (the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U. S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), their spouses and children, including TRICARE for Life beneficiaries entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B based on their age, disability and/or end-stage renal disease. Also eligible are Medal of Honor recipients. Military reservists (and their families) are also TRICARE beneficiaries, for the period in which they are on active duty; or if they choose to enroll to TRICARE Reserve Select; or the TRICARE Retired Reserve program(s). More information about the TRICARE benefit may be found at http://www.tricare.mil/mybenefit/home/overview/Plans.</p>
<p>The MHS must be prepared not only to provide a high quality, cost-effective health care benefit to its eligible members during peacetime, but also must be prepared to support the armed forces during exercises, contingencies, operations other than war, and in wartime. The MHS provides quality medical care through: (1) a network of health care providers and pharmacies in the United States and its territories; and (2) direct care Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) - (hospitals, health and dental clinics) in the Continental United States and overseas. While the number and size of direct care facilities has declined in recent years, it remains important that MTFs are optimized in order to maintain the clinical skills of military clinical staff to support medical readiness. The direct care system cannot fully support the total demand for health care services; therefore, TRICARE uses the direct care system as the main delivery system, and through contracts, augments the direct care system through a civilian network of providers and facilities serving its eligible members.</p>
<p>TRICARE PHARMACY BENEFITS PROGRAM: <br />TRICARE provides a world-class pharmacy benefit to all eligible beneficiaries through the integration of state of the art technologies to enhance patient safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. DoD administers an integrated TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program offering pharmacy services through direct care pharmacy services at MTFs located at various military bases; retail network pharmacies; authorized retail non-network pharmacies; or delivery through the TRICARE Home Delivery/Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP). Retail pharmacy services are available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Features of the pharmacy benefits program include the use of the DoD Uniform Formulary; a tiered cost sharing structure; and a preference for generic over branded products. The DoD formulary lists the pharmaceutical agents, by therapeutic classes, that are authorized as basic program benefits. Prescriptions for selected pharmaceutical agents may be subject to prior authorization or utilization review requirements to assure medical necessity, clinical appropriateness and/or cost effectiveness. DoD has established tiered cost-sharing by which beneficiaries partially defray costs of administering the pharmacy benefits program. Cost-sharing amounts that a beneficiary pays for each prescription will differ based on the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, or non-formulary, in conjunction with the point of service from which the agent is acquired.</p>
<p>See 32 CFR 199.21 and Chapter 55 of Title 10 USC Section 1074g for additional information. Additional information is also available at on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />This RFI is a follow-up to an earlier RFI issued and seeks further information on the commercial pharmacy benefit management practices. TMA is seeking information and recommendations from industry that will improve its approach to a future TRICARE pharmacy benefit management service contract that will support the MHS; and to take advantage of the expertise of the industry and incorporate best practices. Please remember there are statutory and regulatory limitations to how / what TRICARE services are provided to beneficiaries; so recommendations conflicting with these may not be able to be implemented. However, any recommendation regarding administrative requirements; as well as any suggestions to promote a more efficient TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits contract would certainly be welcomed by the Government. Information regarding the specific topics identified below is requested:</p>
<p>a) Enhanced Services</p>
<p>A major function of PBM's today is to assist their commercial clients in influencing beneficiary behavior. This could include making modifications to the benefit plan's design, or developing improved methods of communicating plan information to beneficiaries. We understand these plan enhancements may be purchased as individual programs or as part of an ongoing package of enhancements. The Government is seeking ways to best structure future contracts to ensure the Government has access to all plan upgrades that a PBM would typically provide to its commercial clients. Please discuss various ways commercial contracts are structured to receive at no change in contract price, or to pay for these enhancements (i.e., Per Member Per Month, Tiered Pricing Structure, etc.).</p>
<p>Recognize that there are Government-directed changes to contract requirements. The mandates may include increased benefits for its members and changes to statutes/regulations/policies/procedures. These Government-directed upgrades are incorporated through unilateral change orders to the contract or by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>b) Formulary Management</p>
<p>A major function of PBM's is to assist plan sponsors in benefit design. This includes all areas of formulary management. The Government is interested in ways that that a PBM could support DoD's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee in developing and maintaining the TRICARE formulary. The Government is also interested in best business practices for implementing and managing formulary decisions and what functions a PBM typically performs. For example, ideally, how often should formulary changes be made, once a year or more frequently?</p>
<p>c) Maximum Receipt Time To Receive a Mail Order Prescription</p>
<p>What is the industry standard for mail order turnaround times? Would industry expect turnaround times be calculated from receipt of the prescription until it's shipped or until it's delivered? Would a requirement to verify successful delivery be a cost driver, or is verification a direction that industry is headed in already? What is the optimal method for evaluating contract compliance, (i.e. sampling or some other method)?</p>
<p>d) Medication Therapy Management (MTM) <br /><br />Discuss current retail pharmacy applications of MTM services such as case reviews and therapeutic substitutions by pharmacists. How are these services reimbursed and measured for effectiveness?</p>
<p>e) Call Center Metrics<br /><br />The Government would like its call center requirements to align with industry best practices. The Government would also like to understand the implications and costs for call center metrics, i.e., tighter requirements increasing costs. Should there be variation to account for peak times? Does industry actively attempt to educate consumers about peak times and moderate call volumes?</p>
<p>f) Claim Transaction Turn-around time</p>
<p>For the purposes of this question, transaction time is defined as the time in seconds from the point when a claim is submitted by a retail pharmacy until the pharmacy receives a confirmation or rejection of the claim. Turnaround time includes determination of eligibility, formulary compliance, DUR and all cost calculations. Based on this definition, what is the industry standard for prescription claim processing turnaround time? What is the maximum acceptable turnaround time?</p>
<p><br />g) Incentives</p>
<p>What positive and negative incentives are used in the industry, if any, and how do they impact your operations and proposals. What incentives could be created that would effectively reduce cost and achieve desirable outcomes?</p>
<p>h) PBM Owned Pharmacies</p>
<p>We understand some PBMs own pharmacies. What are the significant benefits (pro and con) of excluding/including PBM-owned pharmacies in a network used to support TRICARE beneficiaries? Please substantiate any cost benefits. What mitigation plans (if any) are in place to prevent conflicts of interest regarding this relationship? Please note any PBM contractor will be required to be a fiscal intermediary on behalf of the Government and engage in program integrity functions (see TRICARE Operations Manual chapter 13) and other pharmacy oversight matters.</p>
<p>i) Competition</p>
<p>What solicitation requirements and other actions can the Government do to promote competition at any stage of the acquisition process?</p>
<p>j) Other</p>
<p>TMA is contemplating developing a solicitation similar to the current contract. A public copy of the current contract is available in the attachment of this FBO announcement. The TRICARE Operations Manual, TRICARE Policy Manual, TRICARE Systems Manual, and TRICARE Reimbursement Manual will be incorporated into the solicitation by reference. These are available for review at www.tricare.mil and may provide insight to interested parties and potential sources. Please provide any other comments not otherwise solicited above.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION<br />This RFI seeks information about approaches that could meet functional requirements. In doing so, the Government seeks to understand the tradeoffs among risks, costs (initial and ongoing) and alternatives that incorporate increasing degrees of sharing.</p>
<p>The Government welcomes alternative concepts for solutions that meet requirements including an overview of new technologies or approaches to providing the requested or similar functionality. The Government encourages creativity and outside-the-box thinking in responses to this RFI. To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses. Capability statements, promotional material, or sales presentations are undesired and will not be read. Request consultants or attorneys describe or identify their client.</p>

<DESC>The following question was submitted for the subject white paper request. The responses are provided. The Response Date remains 29 December 2011. The Army Geospatial Center (AGC) POC is Amy Cole, email is Amy.Cole@usace.army.mil and Contracting Officer is Maria Martinez, email is Maria.L.Martinez@usace.army.mil.<br><br>Question:<br><br>When the solicitation envisions the assessment being "practical and<br>performance-based", does this suggest that you do not want a computer-based<br>assessment?  Is a computer-based assessment that includes video/avatars/etc,<br>sitting on an individual workstation, considered practical or would it be<br>preferred to have a low/no-tech assessment that is manually administered<br>"one on one" and manually scored? <br><br>Response:<br><br>The research description does not omit any form of<br>empirically-sound method for assessing individualized cross-cultural<br>ability. Nor does it suggest that a combination of two or more methods<br>(e.g., computer-based, pencil-paper) would be inappropriate. What it does<br>underscore is our need for assessing observable, quantifiable,<br>performance-based behavior using methods that will be validated,<br>empirically. We need much more than a behavioral model of IC-C ability.<br>Also, we're looking for creative, thoughtful, and expertise- and<br>military-driven ideas about measuring IC-C ability that will increase our<br>understanding and increase potential transition to training.      <br><br><br>

LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION
ORDER >$3,000
FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
2237 Transaction # or Vista Equipment Transaction #: 695-12-1-133-0064

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: Aethon	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  Pete Porco, 412-956-5730
Mfgr/Contractor Address: Aethon, 100 Business Center drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15205
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: Pete Porco, 412-956-5730

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	Milwaukee, WI	

                                                                          VISN:	12	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
Maintenance and service on 6 Aethon TUG robots located at the VA Milwaukee.	

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
Maintenance and service on 6 Aethon TUG robots located at the VA Milwaukee.   This includes service during normal working hours and all parts necessary to make repairs to ensure machines are working to original manufacturer specifications.  This includes all software updates and licensing for the operation of the Aethon TUG robots	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $ xxxxxxxx	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   12/1/2011	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)
1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
Aethon is the manufacturer of the equipment and is the only vendor that has access to provide software updates for the TUG robots.   No other service provider has rights to provide VA with required software updates	

1	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
Aethon TUG robot software licenses	

1	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
Service provider must have access to all Aethon software to ensure maintenance and service requirements are provided.	

 (5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
The items are on FSS contract.  The commercial maintenance cost per TUG/per month is $300.00.  We, receive a 10% discount per TUG/per month. 


According to the national BERS (Biomedical Engineering Resource
Survey)  the national average for a annual full-service contract is 8% of the acquisition cost.    The cost for this contract is 5% annually the purchase price, which is very reasonable.

The robots were $ xxxxxxxx originally (695-A00086) and then there was a upgrade done for $ xxxxxxxx (695- A10530)  to upgrade one existing TUG robot platform and to expand the wireless network into the new Spinal Cord Injury building. So we have invested a substantial amount of money into these robots and it would be advantageous for the VA to pay a few hundred dollars a month to keep these robots serviced and up to date. 

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Web research did not yield any other service providers for Aethon TUG robots.   Additionally Aethon software is proprietary	

 (7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
None.	

 (8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
None. 	

 (9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)

<DESC>
The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) in Milwaukee, WI negotiated on a sole source basis  with B & W Contract Services as the only source able to provide an emergency service to satisfy the Government needs IAW FAR 6.302-2. The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)) due to Unusual and compelling urgency. Award was made to B& W in the amount of $69,446.25 for 1 month emergency maintenance and service contract.
See below attached Justification for other than full and open competition. 








































JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Temperature Controls, B&W Contract Services, Hines VA
VA69D578C20178

1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the repair/service/maintenance of temperature controls for the entire Hines VA grounds.  This procurement will proceed on an emergency sole source basis with B&W Contract Services.

3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  The VA Hospital in Hines, IL, has an emergency requirement for a short term interim service contract to maintain and service all the temperature controls on the Hines VA campus. This service is emergency essential. The approximate cost for 1 month is $69,446.25 

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2.  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)) due to Unusual and compelling urgency.

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The VA Hospital in Hines, IL requires this service because it is emergency essential to have heat and air conditioning in all of the buildings on campus. Presently, Facilities Management Service does not have adequate staff, especially certified HVAC technicians (e.g., Associated Air Balance Council, National Environmental Balancing Bureau, Testing, Adjusting & Balancing Bureau, Honeywell controls, Metasys controls, American Automatrix controls, Alerton controls, etc.) to perform needed temperature control maintenance and services.  All of the control systems are proprietary and are inaccessible by Hines HVAC mechanics and operators.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  It is the belief of FMS that this contract will affect the safety of patients if not provided by the current contractor until a long term contract is able to be competitively awarded. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Hines FMS is diligently working with the GLAC in a combined effort to establish a sustainable contract that covers all facets of operations to ensure a technically competent contractor is found who is able to fulfill the requirements of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The complexity of the content of the SOW, obtaining an IGCE and identifying all equipment by type, location and serial number has taken longer than expected due to the sheer size and magnitude of Hines VAMC and the limited staff of FMS. The scope of work to be completed is extremely technical and has combined what used to be numerous contracts into one streamlined contract to realize a cost savings to the Government and ease of technical oversight by FMS and Contracting. 

8.	Market survey conducted:  There was no survey conducted. All pricing and facts are based on historical data, past procurements and market research going back well over ten years.
 
9.	Other facts:  B&W is the contractor who has been the incumbent for approximately 13 years on this contract. Due to the critical Infrastructure and the nature of work needed, the current company's knowledge of the facility and equipment makes it the only company capable of providing the required critical life support required for these services. B&W is the only company with the ability to maintain the current level of service being provided until a new permanent contract able to be competitively bid and be placed in service. It is not possible for a new company to mobilize, learn the equipment, obtain all licenses and provide emergency services due to the size and massive infrastructure of Hines VAMC.  
The establishment of this contract will ensure continuity of primary care for our veterans who are in extended care and require surgical critical care with the facility.  Any failure of a temperature control system, chillers or other HVAC system components will require the shutdown of critical patient care areas and the surgical service to go on a sustained period of by-pass.

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None sought

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge, based on historical data going back well over ten years.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) Patuxent River, MD</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved.</p>
<p>This justification and approval authorizes and approves, on a sole source basis, a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract between the existing contract N00421-01-C-0077 (a Cost Plus Fixed Fee Completion contract) and the follow-on contract Solicitation # N00421-10-R-1042. This contract will ensure continued support of the Program Executive Office for Ships (PEO for Ships), NAVSEA, and PEO C4I. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is tasked to design, provide materials, integrate, test, train, deliver and support C4I electronic radio communication systems for two Naval Surface Combatants (NSC) of the U.S. Navy. Work will begin on the first NSC in FY11 and work on the second NSC is estimated to begin six months later in FY12. As this is a completion type effort, it is anticipated that each NSC will require 4 &frac12; years to complete.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>This contract provides support to the Integrated Communications and Information Systems (ICIS) Division (Code 4.5.10) of NAWCAD in the design, providing of materials, integration, testing, installation, training, and certification of shipboard C4I electronic communication systems and like systems at shore sites associated with the deployment of or fleet support to surface ships. Receipt, inspection, integration, and testing of the equipment will normally take place at the System's Integration Lab (SIL), NAWCAD, St. Inigoes, Maryland but may occur at the contractor's facility or at other Government facilities. The estimated total value of this procurement is $29,990,000.</p>
<p><br />4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>BAE Systems Technology and Services (BAE), 1601 Research Blvd., Rockville, MD 20850-3173 has been supporting the Integrated Communications and Information Systems (ICIS) Division (Code 4.5.10) of NAWCAD under competitively awarded contract N00421-01-C-0077, which expires 24 June 2011. BAE is the only source capable of designing, integrating, testing, installing, training, and certifying shipboard C4I electronic radio communication systems for two Naval Surface Combatants as they are currently performing these tasks under contract N00421-01-C-0077. It is impossible for another contractor to assume this workload without a transition period, which would cause an unacceptable delay and an increase in program costs due to schedule compression. This contract will avoid a break in service while the follow-on contract is competed and awarded. BAE can provide the corporate capabilites, expertise, and resources needed to effectively meet the rquirements of the Performance Based Statement of Work in the short time period between the exhaustion of the current contract and the follow-on competitive solicitation currently being processed. BAE is the single source capable of providing these efforts without creating an impact on the ships construction schedule.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.</p>
<p>The proposed contract was synopsized via FEDBIZOPPS on 8 February 2011 and no companies have expressed interest. For the reasons discussed in paragraph 5 above, it is not practicable for any company other than BAE to provide required services.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.402, the Contracting Officer shall ensure that all supplies and services provided under this contract are procured at a fair and reasonable price. BAE will submit a formal price proposal with certified cost or pricing data and sufficient information to support the accuracy and reliability of the estimate. Experienced technical analysts, cost analysts, and contract specialists with the aid of necessary field pricing support will review BAE's proposal. The Contracting Officer will utilize cost and price analysis as the basis for negotiating a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.</p>
<p>This action is for a stand alone contract while the follow-on procurement is being competed. A sources sought, including a draft statement of work, was issued via FEDBIZOPPS for the follow-on. Five companies provided capability statements in response to the sources sought synopsis. All five responders were deemed capable and effective competition for the follow-on contract is anticipated.</p>
