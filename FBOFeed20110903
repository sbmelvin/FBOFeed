<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the name and telephone number for a point of contact) to the contract specialist listed in the announcement within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, WRD, Kansas District, has a requirement to provide data for methods developed on an ultra sensitive Applied Biosystems API 5500 triple quadrapole mass spectrometer (TQMS) system. The U.S. Geological Survey, Kansas Water Science Centers (WSC) Organic Geochemistry Research Laboratory (OGRL), requests award of a non-competitive procurement to AB Sciex for a multiyear agreement to service an API 5500 Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (TQMS) for a base performance period of 23 Sept. 2011 to December 31, 2011, and three option years.
For OGRL to fulfill its project obligations the API 5500 TQMS system needs operate continuously.  Thus, proper maintenance and prompt repair is critical for the OGRL to fulfill its mission and obligations to its collaborators. Currently the API 5500 TQMS is covered under a one-year warranty for labor, parts, and two preventive maintenance visits under a one-year warranty service. 
Because the API 5500 TQMS is a relatively new model, ultrasensitive state-of-the-art mass spectrometer with a new design, it is imperative 1) that the instrument be serviced by factory certified engineers with at least four years of experience on the API product line of mass spectrometers and also experience in servicing the API 5500 and API 5500 Q-Trap series mass spectrometers, 2) that access to manufacturer parts is guaranteed, and 3) that the service provider be tied to the instrument manufacturer because new model instruments can have unique issues that cannot be remedied by third party vendors. In addition, researchers at OGRL recently found that the liquid chromatographs (LC) were contaminating its mass spectrometers. Because the API 5500 TQMS system has a bioinert LC on the front end it is currently the only LC/TQMS systems at OGRL that is functioning. Thus, if the API 5500 if the instrument is not properly maintained, or parts cannot be obtained or obtained in a timely manner, or a design problem manifests itself and there is no manufacturer support OGRL will be unable to meet its project obligations, which are substantial and critical to several USGS, other federal agency and other external agency programs. 

Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from AB Sciex and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response shall include literature, brochures and other such materials which correspond to the required services and supplies stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business September 18, 2011 by 3:00 P.M. Mountain Standard Time.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430 with a small business size standard of 100 employees. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a requirement for QLogic brand chipsets for use within the Information Access Division's network. This is a brand name only requirement. NIST requires the QLogic brand chipset because of a compatibility requirement NIST has with Dell computer blades, the Cisco Fiber Channel switches, and NIST's Quantum StorNext filesystem. NIST currently has the Qlogic chipset in the network. Use of other brands could cause network problems that could potentially interrupt network communications and impact the shared network infrastructure which would affect the other computer nodes within the lab. Impacts of these problems include interruptions to tests (some testing runs continuously for months at a time), and/or a slowdown of the processing rate of jobs due to the busy network causing jobs to run much longer resulting in missed deadlines and additional costs to the Government.</p>
<p>Responsible quoters shall provide pricing for the following line item. All equipment must be new.</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity 32 each Qlogic 8Gbps Fibre Channel Card, Part Number QME2572, for NIST's existing Dell M1000E-SeriesBlade Servers. NIST will provide installation.</p>
<p>DELIVERY<br />Delivery shall be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be made to NIST, Shipping and Receiving, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. The procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in according to FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotes (RFQ) HHS-NIH-NLM-11-161-KDP. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through August 2011 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars 2005-53. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 511210; and this acquisition is a small business set-aside. Contract type is fixed price.
<p>BACKGROUND <br />The Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), via its Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP), is responsible for building, coordinating, linking to, and making publicly available online a variety of information resources related to subjects such as toxicology, environmental health, chemical safety, and occupational medicine. Included within this effort are initiatives in education and outreach. An online tutorial known as ToxTutor (http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/Tox/ToxTutor.html), developed over ten years ago, has proved to be a successful tool to educate users of TEHIP's TOXNET databases in the basics of toxicology. To keep pace with significant changes in the subject matter of toxicology and instructional Web technology, it is now time to review, update, and expand these tutorials.<br />NLM has entered into a collaborative engagement with the U.S. Society of Toxicology (SOT) to accomplish this. Through a Steering Team consisting of NLM and SOT staff, and SOT members, a revised outline of 11 modules has been developed for the series, re-named ToxLearn. The Steering Team will be identifying appropriate authors to initially draft content for the modules and work closely with a multi-media production company to iteratively create Web-based products utilizing current Web technologies, including animations, links and audio. The funding of the content portion of this joint project will be undertaken by the SOT. Module 1 is already complete and publicly accessible online (see http://toxlearn.nlm.nih.gov). The present procurement seeks funding for Modules 2 to 11, into the same Flash-based multi-media package, accessible on the Web.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROCUREMENT<br />To continue to work with the authors, the Steering Team (discussed in 1.0 above) and NLM to produce, iteratively refine, and fine-tune tutorials 2-11 to achieve a solid marriage between text and images. <br />Modules 2-5 will cover the following subject areas: 2. Cells and Tissues/Injury and Repair, 3. Modes of Toxicity 4. Toxicity to Organ Systems and 5. Cancer. Modules 6- 11 will be selected from topics such as factors influencing toxicity, toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, toxicity assessment - human, animal, toxicity assessment - ecological and applied toxicology - risk assessment, in silico methods in toxicology, etc.</p>
<p>The contractor will perform the following tasks:<br />1.1 Split the text into pages of approximately 100 words each to allow transparent streaming of data over the Internet (i.e. the next page is preloaded as the current page is read). Although the contractor will not change any content, per se, recommendations may be made to alter or re-structure text to optimize the visual presentation.</p>
<p>In other words...Divide each module into pages (or slides ) of about 100 words to allow transparent streaming of data over the Internet, so that as a page is being read, the next page is being preloaded ...</p>
<p>1.2 Graphic artists will suggest a combination of ready made graphic libraries and tailor made graphics to fit the content. The contractor's development staff will proceed to assemble the program with text, graphics, and animations. The multimedia tutorial will be uploaded to the contractor's server for NLM to review.</p>
<p>1.3 NLM staff and the Steering Team will review the tutorial online. Changes in graphics, as well as minor editorial changes can be requested at this point. NLM will provide the text of the Credits page, which can include a module update date.</p>
<p>1.4 The contractor implements the changes and uploads the newest version of the tutorial online, then e-mails NLM for final approval of text and graphics.</p>
<p>1.5 NLM will approve the text and graphics of the tutorial.</p>
<p>1.6 Optional audio may be added, with the contractor narrating and synchronizing it with the text. NLM reviews the audio and suggests changes, which the contractor then implements. NLM approves the entire package.</p>
<p>1.7 The contractor will provide a Section 508-compliant PDF summary including all the text of the tutorial without questions. Selected colored illustrations will be included in the Summary PDF file.</p>
<p>1.8 The contractor will deliver the packaged module, including the tutorial and PDF, to NLM, with installation instructions.</p>
<p>508 Compliance</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires agencies' electronic and information technology be accessible to people with disabilities. The ToxLearn modules must be Section 508 compliant. Specifically, the end product must be conformant with all applicable provisions, including:</p>
<p>1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.</p>
<p>1194.31 Functional performance criteria.</p>
<p>These provisions can be found at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm</p>
<p>Section 508 Program Need</p>
<p>Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the following program need: Toxicology Instructional Modules.</p>
<p>Technical standards from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those technical provisions identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).</p>
<p>Functional performance criteria from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart C have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those functional performance criteria identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).</p>
<p>Section 508 Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Responses to the solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT, VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.</p>
<p>Section 508 Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>The web site design project deliverables as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility. The proposals for the ToxLearn project must include a GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of the solicitation.</p>
<p>All resulting electronic files and reports delivered by the contractor will become the property of the Government.</p>
<p>The electronic files and reports delivered by the contractor will be reviewed and approved for acceptance by the Project Officer upon delivery by the contractor.<br /><br />Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>After satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility, the evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the perspective vendors to meet the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work. Prospective vendors must submit information sufficient to allow NLM to evaluate based on the stated criteria. Content and technical factors are of paramount consideration; however, cost is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government can make tradeoffs among cost and technical factors in determining which Offeror(s) provide the best value by awarding to other than the lowest cost Offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated Offeror(s). Offeror(s) are advised that award will be made to that Offeror(s) whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.<br />In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:</p>
<p>Soundness of the Approach (40 Points)</p>

Quotes should include examples of previous projects that demonstrate the contractor's ability to analyze and implement technical approaches and/or the contractor's experience with instructional modules in an online flash-based multi-media environment.</p>
<p>Understanding the Problem (20 Points)</p>
<p>Quote demonstrates a thorough and complete understanding of the requirements and indicates a clear awareness of the contract objectives. Quote provides evidence that the offeror has a deep knowledge of the subject to be able to anticipate and avoid problems, and to react appropriately when problems do arise.</p>
<p>Personnel (20 Points)</p>
<p>The proposed staff is competent and experienced in the skills required in the solicitation.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.
