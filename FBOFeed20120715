Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

<DESC>The following below is a list of questions received from potentially interested sources for this RFP and the clarifying answers from the requesting activity for this requirement:<br><br>1) Q: Can you clarify the lodging. We (the contractor) are to BLOCK the rooms and provide the cost with taxes, but we will NOT be paying for the lodging. Is that correct?  <br>   A: Yes. 105 rooms are requested to be blocked, but the service members themselves will call in to the awarded facility make their own reservation and then paying with their own funds.<br><br>2) Q:The conference rooms were defined in two places as conference rooms for adults = 5 and conference rooms for children - 4 for a total of 8. That adds up to 9.....Do you need 8 or 9 conference rooms?<br>   A: We only need 8 conference rooms at the lodging facility/resort if the main meeting room requested (up to 200 adults) can also be used for one of the ADULT breakout sessions at the event following the Saturday morning welcome and introduction briefs. If that is not possible (depending on the facility you are coordinating with) then a 9th (additional) room will be needed.<br><br>3) Q: Can you clarify which conference rooms you need for which days? Example: children conference rooms - Friday night and Saturday only? or also on Sunday? Do you need ALL of the 5 adult conference rooms Friday, Saturday AND Sunday OR just some of the rooms on Sunday?<br>   A: The 4 or 5 adult conference rooms will be needed for both Saturday and Sunday. The child conference rooms will need to be available Friday (Jul 27) after 5:00 pm because the childcare providers (which we will be bringing with us) will need to unload their equipment to set up those rooms for Saturday (Jul 28) and Sunday (Jul 29). Please see the attached Statement of Work on the original synopsis/solicitation for more information.   <br><br>4) Q: It was stated to "provide" snacks and refreshments in the solicitation. Is that just for the children or the adults also. What type of snacks or refreshments are you requesting? Would they be provided both on Saturday and on Sunday?<br>   A: Requested snacks would be any type of "fingerfood" (aka cookies, chips, fruit, etc.) that is defined as a snack in commercial practice and are ONLY requested for the children's rooms on both Saturday & Sunday. Water needs to be available all day in ALL requested conference rooms.
