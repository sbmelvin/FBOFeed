<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of 92 each NetClock/Global Time Provider (GTP) Master Clocks, Spectracom model 8183A and support hardware.     <P> These clocks will replace Mode-S Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellite (GOES) Time of Year (TOY) clocks with Global Positioning System (GPS) Time of Year (TOY) clocks.  Currently, the Mode-S system uses the Kinemetrics, Model 468-DC-071, GOES clock to generate the TOY data stream.  This model has been discontinued and repair service is no longer available.     <P> Spectracom is the only known source which has a commercial off the shelf (COTS) GPS clock that meets all of the FAA requirements of form, fit, and function and can be rapidly deployed and installed in the Mode-S system by FAA site technicians.  A site technician, without taking the Mode-S out of service, can install the TOY clock; thereby, alleviating any potential for air traffic delays.  Spectracom's clock, Model 8183A, including Model 8225 Antenna, has been successfully qualified by the FAA and meets all the requirements of Mode-S.      <P> Interested parties who can comply with this requirement, are requested to provide complete documentation (2 copies) to the contracting officer, FAA, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, NAS Acquisition Contracting Team, AMQ-210, P.O. Box 25082, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK 73125-4929. Facsimiles are accepted at 405-954-9219.

<DESC>Screening Information Request (SIR) DTFA-AC-03-R-06772    <P>   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is announcing its plans for the single source acquisition of Tone Notching/AGC Audio Signal Processors, Digital Signal Products P/N's 200111-2 (799 Each) and 200111-3 (276 Each); and, position and power cables, P/N's 200112-3 (604 Each), 200112-4 (228 Each), 200212-3 (604 Each), and 200212-4 (228 Each), applicable to FAA's Air Traffic Control's Small Tower Voice Switch (STVS), Litton Rapid Deployment Voice Switches (RDVS) 3080-C and E.    <P> A number of voice transmission problems have been reported, from various voice switching sites around the country, where the first syllable(s) or word was being cutoff at the receiving end of an air traffic control (ATC) position.  Several prototypes of each of the six proposed components have been installed and tested at various airports.  They were found to be effective in terms of solving these critical voice switching problems.  Two subsequent engineering studies confirmed the findings of the initial tests.    <P> A market survey was conducted, and between May 1 and May 8, 2001, four manufactures were interviewed, including Litton Systems, the original manufacture of the RDVS System and Digital Signal products, Inc., the manufacture of the tested prototypes.  Only Digital Signal Products, Inc., offered a satisfactory solution to the voice switching problems.  Litton Systems expressed no interest in the proposed modifications.    <P> It is critical that the voice switching problems be corrected as soon as possible.  Current conditions are unsatisfactory and unnecessarily expose the NAS to unacceptable risks that negatively impact the safety of the flying public.  We know of no company, other than Digital Signal Products that is in a position to readily respond with a proven acceptable solution.    <P> Accordingly, the FAA intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price type of contract, with Digital Signal Products, for these items.   <P>

<DESC>HQ, JMC INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO DAY ZIMMERMAN, KANSAS DIVISION.  THE SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT WILL BE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF  FAR 6.302-1 AND IS FOR EXPLOSIVES AND SYSTEMS SUPPORT FOR THE FAMILY OF EDS.  AS DESCRIBED IN THE STATEMENT OF WORK, THE CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF WRITTEN PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS FOR EDS RELATED EXPLOSIVES, PACKAGING SPECIFICATIONS FOR EXPLOSIVE COMPONENTS, AND MANUFACTURING SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE FSSS.  THE CONTRACT ALSO CALLS FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND/OR PROCUREMENT, TEST, STORAGE, AND TRANSPORTATION OF SPECIFIED EDS RELATED, SPECIALIZED EXPLOSIVES. THE EXPLOSIVES ARE THE UNIT 2/3 DETONATORS ASSEMBLY, THE RP-1 DETONATORS, RP-2 DETONATORS, THE 4.2" LINEAR SHAPED CHANGES 45", AND THE 75MM LINEAR SHAPED CHANGES 24".  THIS CONTRACT SHALL BE TO SUPPORT THE EDS PHASE 1 UNITS FOR A PERIOD OF 365 DAYS AFTER CONTRACT AWARD. THE EDS IS A PRODUCT MANAGER, NON-STOCKPILE CHEMICAL MATERIEL (PMNSCM) UNIQUE SYSTEM WITH UNIQUE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.  THE EDS IS A RECENTLY DEVELOPED MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM DESIGNED TO DESTROY AND NEUTRALIZED ARMED CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A PRESSURE VESSEL EQUIPPED WITH THE RELEVANT SUPPORT EQUIPMENT.  TO DESTROY A WEAPON, THE WEAPON IS PLACED IN THE PRESSURE VESSEL, THE MUNITION CONTENTS ARE ACCESSED, AND THE CONTENTS ARE NEUTRALIZED.   THE CONTENTS ARE ACCESSED USING SPECIALLY DESIGNED LINEAR SHAPE CHARGES (EXPLOSIVES).  SPECIALLY DESIGNED CONICAL SHAPED CHARGES ARE ALSO USED TO DESTROY THE WEAPON'S BURSTER.  SPECIALLY DESIGNED CYLINDERS CONTAIN THE METAL FRAGMENTS PRODUCED THE EXPLOSIONS.  THESE CYLINDERS ARE CALLED FRAG SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS (FSS).  THE FSSS MINIMIZE DAMAGE TO THE EDS VESSEL.

THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT'S INVENTORY OF EXPLOSIVES AND EXPLOSIVES COMPONENTS IS INSUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS ANTICIPATED DEPLOYMENT SCHEDULES FOR THE EDS.   ADDITIONAL EXPLOSIVES AND EXPLOSIVE COMPONENTS WILL BE NEEDED BEFORE THE PROJECTED SCHEDULE FOR DELIVERY OF THE SPECIFICATIONS.  THIS SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT WILL OBTAIN THESE EXPLOSIVES AND EXPLOSIVES COMPONENTS TO PREVENT UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS IN THE EDS DEPLOYMENTS. DAY ZIMMERMAN IS THE ONLY KNOWN SOURCE WITH THE UNIQUE CAPABILITIES THAT CAN MEET THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUIREMENTS AND SCHEDULES.  DAY ZIMMERMAN IS THE ONLY COMMERCIAL SOURCE WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE ON HOW THE ORIGINAL EXPLOSIVES AND EXPLOSIVE COMPONENTS WERE DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, TESTED, AND PACKAGED. NOTE 22.   THE PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF  FAR 6.302-1. THE GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY LACKS MANUFACTURING, PROCUREMENT, AND PACKAGING SPECIFICATIONS FOR COMPETITIVELY PROCURING THE EDS SUPPLIES.

HOWEVER, ALL PROPOSALS RECEIVED WITHIN FORTY-FIVE DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS SYNOPSIS WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT.   A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE WITH THIS PROPOSED CONTRACT BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and
testified to by the submitter; and
(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun &

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after

This RFP is being issued under 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The associated NAICS code 334519 with a small business size standard of 500.  The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has a requirement for a New Shaker and Amplifier System to support the Payload Checkout Facility for its Space Science Division.  The NRL's payload checkout facility's vibration lab is responsible for testing spacecraft structures and components. The Vibration Test System will be used to test large heavy objects, which together with fixturing, weighs as much as 4,000 pounds (1815 Kg). The vibration test profiles in MIL-STD-1540C for space vehicles, to include random, sine, sine burst, and shock, will be utilized. These specifications require up to 2 inch (51 mm) pk-pk displacement. Most of the energy occurs at low frequencies. The shaker system will be mounted on a 200 ton seismic mass.  The vibration lab has four shakers, three amplifiers, three field supplies, and three cooling units, all of which can be interconnected through a switching unit to cross various components of the system.  The final product is the ability to interconnect required amplifier, or field supply or cooling unit to selected shaker to minimize down time in the case of a component failure of the system.  NRL has a requirement for Contract Line Item(s) CLINs as follows:  CLIN 0001- The Contractor shall provide; quantity: one (1), unit: EA, Shaker in accordance with the following specification:  The Shaker shall be bolted on a seismic mass located at NRLs test facility, which will be used as a reaction mass.

<DESC>IMPORTANT NOTICE: DFARS 252.204-7004 "Required Central Contractor Registration" applies to all solicitations issued on / or after 06-01-98.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror / quoter INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD.  Please ensure compliance with this regulation when submitting your quote.  Call 1-888-227-2423 or visit the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov/ for more information.  FISC San Diego intends to award, on a sole source basis, a firm fixed price contract to Integra Communications Inc. in Rocklin, California.  The contract is a continuation of services currently provided by the Contractor at the site.  The contract will be awarded under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Contractor will provide preventive maintenance, routine and emergency service calls, and training and quarterly system inspection and testing.  Service and maintenance of the security and life safety functions at the Miramar Brig requires a thorough knowledge of both the installed fire alarm system, as well as the Secure-Tech brand logic control system.  The security (locking) control and fire reporting system is an antiquated system with limited detailed supporting and technical documentation.  Some technical drawings and data have not been revised to reflect upgrades to the system.  Integra Communication and Secure-Tech currently employ many of the original personnel who designed and installed the system approximately 23 years ago.  Parts availability may also be a problem, as some required parts are only available from the original equipment manufacturer and Integra Communications is an authorized agent.  The Contractor will provide service to maintain the brig's security (locking) control and fire reporting systems.  Service includes: maintenance of the fire alar m and security reporting system, locking control system including panels, watch tour system, guard duress system, intercom system, paging system, staff duress system, master antenna and television system, and the master and closed circuit surveillance system.  Many of the critical functions that exist at this facility use a complex combination of the capabilities of both of these systems.  This system utilizes the distributed data communications function used by each respective system to accomplish control, communications, annunciation, and reporting.  The installed fire alarm system is a distributed data multiplexed type fire alarm system manufactured by FAST, Inc. in the 1980's.  This fire alarm system is utilized as a communications backbone for most security and life-safety functions.  This system not only supervises all fire related functions and alarms, but is heavily int erfaced with the Secure-Tech Inc. brand of distributed microprocessor logic controllers for such functions as Duress, Emergency Release, Lockdown, Guard Watch-tour and all trouble alarms such as power supply failure alarms and low battery alarms.  This is a commercial synopsis for a commercial service prepared in accordance with FAR parts 12 and 15.  Solicitation number N00244-03-R-0029 applies; an electronic copy of the RFP can be accessed at http://www.neco.navy.mil on or about 2/28/03.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12 and DFAR Change Notices effective through 12/20/02.  The standard industrial code is 3669 (NAICS 334290) and the business size standard is 750 employees.  This contract will commence on 04/01/03 and include a base year and two option years.

<DESC>Democratic Development and Citizen Participation Project (DDCP) RFP Solicitation Notice Description:  The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement the program described below.  The DDCP has been a joint effort between the Bolivian and U.S. governments since 1995.  That year, USAID/Bolivia (USAID/B) authorized an eight year DDCP project to support democratic development in Bolivia including implementation of the 1994 Popular Participation Law (PPL).  The PPL and 1995 Constitutional Reforms created for the first time in Bolivia a democratic political environment which not only enabled, but required citizens to participate fully in the decisions affecting their lives.  The DDCP project is now at a point where further work is needed to strengthen and sustain the work accomplished over the past eight years. USAID/B estimates the total cost of DDCP not to exceed $15 million, including funds for grants.  Emphasis will be on the replication of lessons learned thus far and further application of an already existing participatory municipal planning model and a parallel gender model.  The new, five-year DDCP project?s purpose is to: (a) strengthen citizen participation in municipal and national government; and (b) develop the ability of municipal governments, national and departmental institutions to respond effectively to the demands resulting from increased and directed citizen participation.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals and quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number RFQ-OH-03-00035 is issued as a Request for Quotation/Request for Proposal. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-07. This simplified acquisition is  being processed using full and open competition. The NAICS code is 541620.  Title:	Method of Analysis to Perform a Tissue-Based Cumulative Risk Assessment for Mixtures of Chemicals A.  Background: 	While most human health chemical risk assessments are based on laboratory findings in animals  which were exposed only to the chemical of interest (a single-chemical exposure), humans are not so uniquely exposed.  Human exposures to chemical mixtures are the norm, in both therapeutic exposures (solvent, diluent, formulating agents, and active ingredients), environmental exposures to  pesticides (active pesticide agents, synergists, surfactants), and through the consumption of drinking water (which may contain more than one hundred disinfectant by-products), as well as pesticides and break-down products, and other contaminants of ground- and surface-water sources not fully  removed by treatment. Given the differences in exposure scenarios (acute versus chronic, daily versus seasonal, differences in anticipated exposure routes (oral, dermal and inhalation), exposures may vary by several orders of magnitude.  Beyond this, differences in chemical-specific metabolism and  blood and tissue solubility produce various dosimetries such that organs and tissues realize qualitatively (chemical moieties - parent chemical versus metabolites) and quantitatively different exposure concentrations. These factors are the determinants of pharmacokinetic (PK) differences among and  within animal species.  Differences in the manifestation of toxicity are also dependent on the molecular attributes of the chemical, which determine the ability of the chemical to interact with bio-molecules like DNA or proteins (enzymes, receptors) in a specific or non-specific manner to produce  their effect.  The interaction of toxicant with bio-molecule initiates the pharmacodynamic (PD) phase of the response.  This is generally referred to as the mechanism or mode of action which indicates the sequence of events leading to toxicity and suggests a specific mathematical model for  describing the process.  The interaction of these PK and PD factors describes the response.   	The PK of toxicants has been studied in quantitative detail for a number of years, successfully employing the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling technique. This, and any other  (non-physiological) PK approach, requires that toxicity information be complete enough to determine whether the parent chemical or a metabolite is responsible for the toxicity, and that the target organ or tissue be identified.  The approach usually follows the collection of chemical specific  information on the "in vivo" PK of the compound of interest, and the development of a mathematical description of the tissue compartments, blood flows and tissue partitioning information for the chemical in the same animal as the PK data were collected.  The PBPK model is developed by comparing its  predictions against the data collected from whole-animal studies.  Then, the model is exercised to simulate another exposure scenario for which data are available, but have not previously been utilized to develop the model.  If the  simulation of "unknown" data by the model represents a good "fit"  then the model is considered validated.  The model is then scaled to represent the human and model predictions are compared to data determined in the human, if available.  Then, the model is utilized to simulate the exposure of interest in the human and concentrations of the toxic chemical moiety  are determined in the target tissue of interest (see Clewell et al., 2002).  Recent advances in PBPK modeling have demonstrated the ability of the technique to include extrapolations made from data on chemical metabolism and enzyme contents derived from in vitro- human and research animal tissue  preparations (Kedderis, 1997; Kedderis and Held, 1996; Lipscomb et al., 1998; Snawder and Lipscomb, 2000), and to adequately simulate the internal concentrations of toxicants following a concomitant exposure to multiple chemicals (Dobrev et al., 2002; Haddad et al., 2002; Yang et al., 1995). 	This  acquisition is in the scientific area of cumulative risk: the risk following the exposure to multiple chemicals via multiple pathways.  It is funded from the area of drinking water, and is therefore constrained to address mixtures of drinking water chemicals.  However, the approach must be  restricted to only the oral pathway; the PBPK model must be described in such detail as to allow for the inclusion of the dermal and inhalation pathways, as well, when supporting data are available.  The prime goal of this acquisition is to organize and communicate a method by which to translate  external exposure concentrations/durations to tissue concentrations of toxicologically active chemical moieties specifically for the purpose of risk assessment.  The method shall specifically address the dose-dependency of chemical toxicity with respect to identifying the critical organ and the  possibility that chemical exposures, in a mixture setting, may increase target tissue concentrations to recruit additional organ toxicity.  While this acquisition specifies two separate water-relevant chemical mixtures, one of the mixtures will be comprised of methyl-parathion, parathion,  chlorpyrifos, fenthion, diazinon, and fenitrothion.  The second mixture shall be comprised of four chemicals, and the selection of those chemicals shall be made by and justified by the contractor.   B.  Purpose:  	The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain 1) a method or framework consistent  with and summarizing US EPA guidance (US EPA, 2000; 2002), to identify relevant mixtures and exposure scenarios for environmental contaminants for humans, an approach to link the exposure information to tissue concentrations of toxic moieties in appropriate target tissues/organs, and to perform a  cumulative risk assessment for the mixture based on sound mixtures-toxicity- principles, 2) descriptions of two chemical mixtures (one specified above) to which the method can be applied, and 3) a presentation of findings to the EPA in Cincinnati, Ohio.  This work shall address a mixture in which  the component chemicals are deemed to act through the same toxic mechanism or mode of action, and a mixture in which the components are deemed not to act through the same mechanism or mode of action.  In that respect, the method developed shall go beyond that proposed by US EPA (2002). C.  Quality  Requirements: 	This acquisition is to integrate existing data and information on health risk assessment, including pharmacokinetic, metabolic and mechanistic information, to better enable the assessment of the cumulative risk of chemical mixtures.  As such, published and peer-reviewed works on  these subjects, developed for this purpose will serve as reference material (see reference section for some examples of pertinent literature).  If the contractor is aware of other significant and relevant information available in the peer reviewed literature which relates to the cumulative risk of  chemical mixtures, then that information shall also be included.  The final report from this acquisition shall communicate a logical framework on which to organize and interpret complex data related to the pharmacokinetics, metabolism and mechanism of action of individual components of chemical  mixtures.  It shall contain a concise approach (specifically including considerations of dose-dependency of toxic mechanism and target organ) to guide the interpretation of mechanistic information such that the appropriate choice of mixtures toxicity models (e.g., dose addition, response addition,  etc) can be developed and sufficiently defended.  US EPA (2002) has produced significant and thoughtful guidance on the identification of mixture components which act through the same mechanism of action, and the approach to developing a cumulative risk for mixtures of chemicals acting through a  common mechanism.  However, that guidance does not address metabolic interactions or pharmacokinetic considerations.   This acquisition will broaden the existing guidance by developing considerations and an approach to identify the key events in the mechanism of action for chemicals acting through  different mechanisms, to identify possible overlap between the mechanisms of chemicals which are dissimilar but which share a common facet of underlying biochemistry or physiology, and to expand the approach to include metabolic and pharmacokinetic information.  Specific attention shall be devoted  to addressing metabolic interactions by specifying which types of data should be included to identify the enzyme or family of enzymes responsible for metabolism, interdependence of enzymes acting on different components of the chemical mixture on endogenous cofactors which are related, the  potential for competition for metabolism by the same enzyme, and the risk-related effects of such metabolic competition including substrate concentrations attained in vivo from experimental exposures of research animals and environmental exposures of humans and consideration of enzyme kinetics.   The approach developed shall specify the information required and demonstrate how such information should be used to integrate metabolic interactions in a pharmacokinetic framework.   To summarize, the final report shall contain a framework through which to address chemical mixtures' cumulative  risk, and clearly demonstrate a step-wise series of considerations aimed at integrating information on mechanism of action, metabolism and pharmacokinetics, culminating with tissue doses of toxicologically-active chemical moieties and choice of mixtures toxicity model (dose-addition,  response-addition).  It shall include a summarization of key points included in guidance developed by US EPA (2000, 2002) and shall communicate that summarization at a level of detail sufficient for presentation to a toxicologically-oriented audience.  The report shall be developed and formatted so  that minimal changes are required for publication in the peer-reviewed literature. The evaluation of the two mixtures of chemicals shall be presented as separate sections in the report and shall be organized according to the framework developed.  The presentation at EPA in Cincinnati shall be made  from Microsoft PowerPoint slide file(s) and shall be made available to the EPA Project Officer at least one week before the presentation so that review and revision (if necessary) can be accomplished. D.  Tasks: The contractor shall: 	1.  	Prepare Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  Develop  and submit within 15 days after the purchase order award as the first deliverable before the literature search or data compilation work begins.  The contractor shall not perform any work under this purchase order until the QAPP is reviewed and approved by the P.O.  Address in the QAPP how the  contractor is going to consider or evaluate the quality of the secondary data that is to be used to carry out this purchase order.  Secondary data is defined as the review or use of someone else's environmental or health data that was developed for purposes different from that covered in this  purchase order.  This includes data used from citations in the published literature, from hard copies of published reports or from computer data bases (reference http://www.epa.gov/oei). 	2.   	Develop the Approach.   Apply this expertise to develop and communicate a sophisticated and  scientifically sound approach which may be used to assess the risks of chemical mixtures.  The approach shall culminate in the application of  physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling, and the description of the approach shall specifically address the identification and collection/development  of data describing both the passive phenomena involved in pharmacokinetics (blood flow, blood:tissue partitioning, etc.) as well as the biologically active (interdependent) phenomena, such as chemical metabolism.  The approach shall contain scientific valid justifications for the collection,  interpretation and inclusion of such data.  The contractor is not tasked with developing a review of the multiple laboratory approaches (in vitro protocols) to developing such individual data.  The approach shall be presented as a series of steps with an adequate description of each and references  for each, attesting to the validity of the step.  The approach shall begin with the selection of chemicals and exposures and culminate with steps appropriate to guide the integration of PK data and information on the mechanism of toxicity into a scientifically defensible estimate of the risks of  the mixture under evaluation.  The selection of four chemicals for the second (unspecified) drinking water chemical mixture shall be defended by presenting information sufficient to justify the logical conclusion that the human is simultaneously exposed to the individual chemical components of the  mixture.  These four chemicals must have either, 1) the same mode/mechanism of action, 2) the same target organ of toxicity at low doses, or 3) have a toxic sequella manifest as the same biological event.  The contractor shall present their professional estimation of whether the toxicity  (qualitative and quantitative) of the two mixtures (separately) are likely to be based on metabolic interactions among the components of the mixture at biologically plausible human exposure concentrations.  Logical assumptions may be included in the estimation, but must be specifically identified.   Later (not in this acquisition), an attempt will be made to apply this approach to the chemical mixture identified by the Contractor.  While information on tissue partition coefficients is not as limiting in application of PBPK modeling of mixtures as are data on metabolic interactions, the  contractor must select components of the mixture so that the mixture represents a group of no more than four chemicals whose metabolism has been studied to some detail previously.  Specifically, the information summarized by the Contractor on the components of the four-chemical mixture must include  a description of the information available to determine which enzyme family is responsible for it's metabolism and specific information on enzyme specificity and biochemical rate constants available for that chemical.   		The approach shall be based on a) similarity or dissimilarity of the  toxic 		 mechanism or mode of action and target tissue sufficient to ascertain whether the toxicity of the mixture would represent a summation of the individual doses (target tissue concentrations) of mixture components or whether the toxicity of the mixture might best be represented by adding the  responses of the individual components based on their unique concentrations in target tissues, b) the grouping of chemicals according to mechanism of action, c) identification of target organs/tissues, d) the identification of toxicologically active chemical moieties, e) application of a mixtures  PBPK approach including metabolism kinetic interactions of components, to ascertain target tissue concentrations of toxicologically active chemical species, f) the selection and application of an appropriate mixtures toxicity approach. 	3.	Identify two relevant chemical mixtures; develop and  categorize the information available to enable the application of the approach to the two chemical mixtures.   Submit to the EPA Project Officer the two examples of chemical mixtures for evaluation under the proposed approach, defining the composition of each mixture, and providing an environmental  and/or occupational exposure-relevant justification for their assessment as chemical mixtures.  This justification shall include pertinent information (including previously published pharmacokinetic investigations) for each component of the mixture which can be used to define or justify the choice  of mechanism or mode of action, pertinent pharmacokinetic information, pertinent chemical metabolism information, and other information deemed appropriate for the mixture components under evaluation.  The justification is not intended to be a summary of all pertinent literature, simply a series of  paragraphs presenting the logic flow that resulted in the decision to consider the components and the mixture, highlighting the feasibility of a successful application of the approach, including data availability. 	4.  	Present the approach in professional seminar in Cincinnati, OH.   These  approach shall be presented in a professional seminar to EPA scientists at the Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center, 26 W. Martin Luther King, Cincinnati, Ohio during September, 2003.  The Contractor shall make all arrangements for round trip travel, including overnight lodging if  necessary.  	5. 	 Compile the final report. E.  The EPA will: 	1.	Review draft deliverables and provide comments within 7 days of receipt.   	2.	Provide the NCEA Instruction Manual for Contractors (dated March 2002). F.  Milestones and Deliverables:	 	 	Submit QA Project Plan (March, 2003) 	Submit the draft approach (April, 2003)  	 	Submit the final approach (July, 2003) 	 	Submit the draft information on chemical mixtures and available information (June, 2003) 	 	Submit the draft final report (July, 2003) 	 	Subm

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., for a fifteen-month extension to contract NO1-LM-0-3525, "National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature."  The Kennedy Institute is responsible for the acquisition and indexing of bioethics-related books, journal articles, reports and other items not indexed in NLM search systems. The Reference Center houses the largest repository for bioethics literature in the world today. The collection is both diverse in its informational sources and formats relating to medicine and biomedical research. The Kennedy Institute continues to index over 3,600 new citations to documents in biomedical and professional ethics annually.  The Library collection includes more than 25,000 volumes on a vast array of ethical and bioethical subjects including Congressional reports and reports from international commissions.  The collection houses all documents related to the U.S. President?s Commission on Ethical Problems in Biomedical Research including additional literature concerning the ethical and legal aspects of the Human Genome Project.  Additionally, the collection includes over 200 audiovisuals that may be viewed directly at the Library.  Special collections include the Kampelman Collection in Jewish Ethics and the Shriver Collection in Christian Ethics.  Archival holdings include the President?s Commission and New Jersey Bioethics Commission documents as well as numerous other copies of transcripts, reports and briefing materials from other related sources. It has been determined that the Kennedy Institute is the only source that can maintain such a broad and comprehensive literature collection and one which is inextricably linked to the NLM search and retrieval systems on ethics and bioethics literature. The Kennedy Institute owns the rights to a substantial portion of the data produced making them the only source capable of fulfilling NLM's requirements without undue delays and duplication of effort.  During this fifteen-month extension the NLM will be conducting an evaluation of the Bioethics coverage by the Kennedy Institute under this contract and contract NO1-LM-0-3522 "Creation of Bioethics Citations for NLM Search Systems" to determine whether changes or consolidation of these efforts are required which would be incorporated into the statement of work for any subsequent sole-source renewal. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NLM.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Ocean Service, Hollings Marine Laboratory, on behalf of the Coral Disease and Health Consortium,  plans to procure services for two phases of research design and analyses.  Phase I is for services for Antigen Design, Antigen Synthesis and Antibody Production.  This phase  will include producing antibody reagents for a scelractinian coral specific suite of cellular parameters for use in coral health assessment.  Phase II is for services for high-throughput ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) analysis of coral tissue.  This phase will provide concentration (amount/total soluble protein) measures of a defined suite of cellular pararmeters in coral tissue for diagnostic health assessment.  Phase I work should be completed within 6 months of procurement initiation.  Phase II work should be completed within 60 days of receipt of samples.  The technical specifications of the work for Phase I are as follows: The Hollings Marine Laboratory, the client, will provide the Contractor a list of biomarkers for antibody production.  Biomarkers for production will include  ubiquitin, chloroplast small heatshock protein, Hsp70 cnidarian (inducible form, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (cnidarian form and algal form), manganese superoxide dismutase (algal) and the P toxin from Vibrio shiloi, and Coral or symbiotic algae DNA sequence information.  There may be an additional 10 biomarkers for antibody production.  These will be identified as high priority for antibody production as information becomes available.  The Contractor shall conduct sequence alignments from which they will design peptide antigens for use in antibody production; The candidate peptides anticgens for each of the target biomarkers will be submitted by the Contractor to the client for review and approval.  After approval, the Contractor shall proceed with antigen synthesis and antibody production.  The antibodies are to be produced in rabbits.  The second phase of high-throughput ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) analysis of coral tissue will include the following: ELISA analysis of cellular parameters, as defined by the client, will be conducted for up to 500 coral samples from frozen tissue powders.    The samples will be provided in batches up to 100 samples as delineated by the sampling and experimental design of the Hollings Marine Laboratory.  The Contractor shall perform the following: Solubilize approximately 20 - 50 mg of tissue powder from each sample in an appropriate extraction buffer determined by the Contractor; Determine protein concentration of the tissue extract; Perform western blots with 2-3 random samples from the client and performance samples for a defined set of antibodies; Contractor will proceed with ELISA optimization and analyses after the blots have been reviewed by the client for suitability; Upon approval, ELISA optimization will be conducted for antibody titer; Conduct high through-put ELISA for a suite of assays (up to 22 assays per sample) that will be defined on a per batch basis and according to the experimental design prescribed by the client.  Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria: (1) Experience in the area of work.  (2)   Quality Control Plan/Measures. (3) Ability to Perform the work.  (4) Past Performance.  Technical proposal is significantly more important than price proposal. The resultant procurement will be a firm-fixed price contract.  NAICS code 541710 applies.

<SUBJECT>S -- On-Call Armed and Unarmed Guards
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-021303
<RESPDATE>022803
<CONTACT>Thomas McFadden, Contract Specialist, Phone 202/353-4063, Fax 202/307-9695, Email Thomas.McFadden@usdoj.gov
<DESC>The USMS has a requirement for the services of armed and unarmed guards in the Dallas-Ft. Worth region each of whom must meet the following requirements: active or former commissioned law enforcement officers, Certified Law Enforcement Training (CLEET), no criminal record, no history of emotional/mental illness, alcohol or drug abuse, in good standing with their department, U.S. citizenship, at least 21 years of age, speak fluent English, and possess a valid drivers license. Some female guards are required and some guards with Spanish language skills are necessary.  
The services to be performed include transporting Federal prisoners, guarding prisoners confined to a medical facility for treatment, guarding prisoners within a U.S. Courthouse building and holding facilities, and providing security for Government-seized property.  Unarmed guards may be appropriate for court security and cell block assignments only at the discretion of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).  The services are required on an "on call" basis. This means that  24 hours a day, 7 days a week the contractor must be prepared to assign guards to receive Federal prisoners within 2 hours of receiving a verbal request from the COTR. The contractor must provide a list or roster of qualified persons that the contractor has available for performance of the contract and maintain that list throughout the life of the contract as new personnel become available or others become unavailable.  The contractor may only assign guards from that roster and must employ supervisors who meet the same standards as the guards.
The contractor will be responsible for providing all equipment required for its guards including but not limited to uniforms and approved restraining devices for prisoners in its custody. The contractor is responsible for transporting prisoners in secure vehicles such as screened vans or sedans. The Government will not reimburse contractor's expense as a separate billable cost; the contractor must recover that expense within the contract price of the hourly charge negotiated for guard services ordered by the Government and delivered.
Actual quantities of services required under this contract are unknown.  The quantities will vary according to the operational requirements of the Government. Maximum quantities that may be ordered will be 3000 hours of armed and 2500 hours of unarmed service per year.  If the Government's actual requirements do not result in orders in the quantities estimated, that fact will not constitute a basis for equitable adjustment.  In 2002, under the existing contract, the Government has ordered approximately 1604 hours of armed and 1184 hours of unarmed services.  The Government anticipates that a base year contract with 4 twelve-month priced option periods will be awarded.  Any contract will incorporate the Service Contract Act.
The Government estimates that the Request for Proposals will be available on or after March 15, 2003. Parties interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation should e-mail the POC and when the solicitation is available on the web, each will be notified.  Interested parties are requested to include with that e-mail a Capabilities Statement to assist this market research. For example: identify and certify one's business size, outline the scope of one's existing personnel resources in Northern Texas or ability to build a roster of qualified personnel, one's experience in fulfilling other Government contracts of this type, and any other statements regarding capabilities that are relevant.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce a U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) Joint Deployment Process Owner (JDPO) request for information (RFI) from industry.  The intent of the RFI is to identify capability and concepts for reengineering 'end-to-end' joint deployment/redeployment processes and architecture through use of industry standard Business Process Reengineering (BPR) methodologies.  

Ultimate Objective of BPR Initiative:
The ultimate objective of the BPR initiative is to comprehensively reengineer process activities spanning strategic, operational and tactical levels as well as activities to enable movement of force capability from origin to final destination. This includes all activities in the currently doctrinally defined (Joint Publication 3-35, Deployment/Redeployment) phases consisting of pre-deployment activities, movement to and activities at the port of embarkation, movement to the port of debarkation, joint, reception, staging, onward movement and integration, and redeployment.  

The desired outcome from the BPR initiatives include fully documented and implemented integrated architectures associated with the reengineered process, identification of changes required to existing doctrine, policy, regulations or guidelines identified to implement the reengineered processes/procedures design of a new process to streamline the existing process, creating greater speed, accuracy, visibility, and agility while aiming for a 'seamless' environment.  

Information Requested:
JDPO is not in the development or BPR business and seeks capabilities, methodologies and approach concepts to develop an understanding of what is available in industry as it relates to JDPO and BPR.  Therefore, submissions should include the description of an approach to achieve the reengineering objectives of the JDPO/BPR process.  

The deliverables from this RFI should include a brief 'white paper' description of your reengineering capability and approach that fits the requirements described above.  The response should normally be 15 pages or less and should describe how your company would approach this requirement to meet the outcomes described.  The following information is available as attachments to this announcement:  
-High-Level Operational Concept Graphic
-Operational Information Exchange Matrix
-Joint Deployment Operational Architecture

Your recommended approach should meet the following core principals: 

-Identify the difficulties and deficiencies in producing critical outputs/products associated with the existing end-to-end joint deployment process;
-Analysis of alternative methods and process that would eliminate the deficiencies associated with the current process;
-Description and depiction of the integrated architectures that identify the alternative methods and processes that have been incorporated into a reengineered 'to be' joint deployment process; 
-Transition strategy that identifies the implications for changes to doctrine, policy, regulation, guidance, training, and systems in order to transition to the reengineered process;
-Priority and feasibility matrix for implementation and methodology to implement and enforce operational capability objectives. 

THIS REQUEST IS FOR INFORATION ONLY.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATON SOLICITED.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as result of the submission of industry information. As industry may see portions of submitted information in future solicitations, NO PROPRIETARY OR COPYRIGHT INFORMATION SHALL BE SUBMITTED.  In addition, you may submit information regarding existing contracts where your reengineering services are available under GSA contracts. 

Response Submission Procedure:
Those interested in responding to this RFI should submit responses to paul.phelps@jfcom.mil.  USJFCOM/JDPDO will accept responses for two weeks from the date of this CBC announcement (actual date shown above). 

In addition to the information provided above that was published in the initial 10 February 2003 RFI, the following information is provided:

The ?To Be? documentation published with the original RFI was done in 1998 with a few updates since.  It envisioned a streamlined process using a mature ?single master database? in a ?concurrent collaborative environment?.  The blue cloud in the diagram is an illustrative example of the ?collaborative environment?.  Mapping the concept was as far as Department of Defense got although some of the concepts matured beyond where they were and are actually being used (mostly piecemeal) currently in the deployment process.  Some of the elements/attributes of this old ?To Be? are still accurate, but USJFCOM is not bound to any of them.  USJFCOM does not necessarily want to implement what is defined there, but actually are willing to start from a blank sheet and design a new process from scratch or at least see what that would look like.  The documents were given with the RFI as a frame of reference, not necessarily a starting point.  Also, USJFCOM is curious to take a more contractor/commercial industry view of these processes as opposed to the way the original ?To Be? was done.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently identifying corporate entities that might be interested in helping support the agency?s Youth Media Campaign, VERB. TM It?s what you do. (www.cdc.gov/verb ; www.VERBparents.com ; www.VERBnow.com )  VERB is a national, multicultural, multimedia campaign aimed at encouraging healthy lifestyles among youth, ages 9-13, with the help of parents, educators, youth leaders, and others who influence youth.  The Campaign encourages physical activity as a means to address various health issues including overweight and sedentary lifestyles, diabetes, stress reduction, mental health, tobacco use, and a host of other unhealthy risky behaviors that physical activity helps displace.  The Campaign is beginning its second year in a planned five-year effort.  The Campaign is working with leading marketing and advertising agencies, the media, and organizational and corporate partners to achieve its goal.  The Campaign would like to talk with corporate entities that share a common mission and would be interested in furthering the Campaign?s reach and impact with both our youth and adult audiences.  Specifically, the Campaign is interested in talking with companies that can:
1)Extend the campaign messages through advertising, marketing, product packaging, and customer communication;
2)Offer incentives or rewards for youth involvement in physical activity at a national or local level;
3)Assist our current nine VERB communities in overcoming the barriers to  youth involvement in physical activity.  The 2002-2003 communities are: Los Angeles, CA; Houston, TX; Miami, FL; Washington, DC; Kansas City, MO; Spokane, WA; Greenville, SC; Columbus, OH; Green Bay, WI;
4)Help sponsor VERB events occurring in these cities;
5)Reach employee groups with messages about the importance of youth/family involvement in physical activity.

Corporations interested in talking with the Campaign should send an e-mail to VERBsupport@cdc.gov so we might contact you.  Your e-mail should include your name, company, phone number, and areas of interest.

<DESC>The Product Manager for Crew Served Weapons is seeking sources for the execution of the rapid production of the XM312, Light Weight .50 Caliber Machine Gun.  The XM312 will be developed on an accelerated schedule to address urgent need requirement to deliver 50-100 weapons within 16 months of contract award with initial delivery within 12 months.   The XM312 will eventually replace the M2 for both the mounted and dismounted roles. The Product Manager foresees complex issues of integrating designs and requirements of the weapon system, supportability, and integration with current and future vehicles during development.  System Description:  The XM312 consists of a light weight low recoil weapon (ground or vehicle mountable) and a ground mount.  The XM312 system, weapon and tripod only, will weigh no more than 45 pounds.  The XM312 recoil force will be less than half of the M2s recoil.  The XM312 system dispersion will be less than a third of the M2s dispersion.  The XM312 will be capable of firing standard .50-caliber cartridge types used in the M2 machine gun which are the M33 ball, M17 tracer, M8 armor-piercing incendiary (API), the M20 API tracer, the M903 sabot light armor penetrator (SLAP), the M962 SLAP tracer and the Mk211 multipurpose.  The system will have an effective range out to 2,000 meters.  The sustained rate of fire will exceed or equal the M2s sustained rate of fire of 40 rounds per minute.  The system should be rugged enough to withstand military use, including airborne and shipboard operations without degradation of the XM312s performance.  The weapon provides automatic weapon suppressive fire for offensive and defensive purposes. This weapon can be used effectively against personnel, light armored vehicles; low, slow flying aircraft; and small boats.  The weapon must be able to be re-configured to fire a family of 25mm fuzed and unfuzed ammunition.  The 25mm variant weapon must maintain a high percentage of common components with the .50 caliber configuration.  The 25mm configuration must be able to mount and control a ruggedized, compact, single, integrated full solution day/night target acquisition/fire control (TA/FC) system capable of all weather operations.  The weapon must have mounted switches to interface with the TA/FC for the 25mm configuration and will command the laser rangefinder and allow manual manipulation of the airburst range of a fuzed munition.  The 25mm ammunition and TA/FC described above are not to be developed under this effort. The offeror must have working developmental prototypes or test beds to demonstrate both the XM312 and the 25mm variant. The offeror must conduct testing to verify models and designs. This testing would include but is not limited to aeroballistic testing, weapon recoil mitigation, system characterization, and weapon load testing.  The deliverables will be two XM312 prototype systems for testing 8-10 months after contract award followed by 50- 100 low rate production weapons 12-16 months after contract award. The government is interested only in those potential offerors who have specific knowledge with this subject matter and have experience to conduct a successful development and rapid production phase within the 16 month period, and can meet the U.S. Armys minimum technical requirements listed in the System Description paragraph. In response to this survey, contractors should provide specific knowledge, abilities (including drawings and results of their working prototypes), and past efforts that will give the government the required confidence that the contractor is capable of executing a successful program. Offerors considering a teaming arrangement with other companies should provide notice to that effect as well as provide individual team member specific knowledge, abilities, and past efforts. Interested offerors and those of their team members should submit their qualifications for executing this phase of the program within 30 days to: Commander, US Army TACOM-ARDEC, Acquisition Center, AMSTA-AQ-APD, BLDG. 10, ATTN: Kelly Gerould, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, email: kgerould@pica.army.mil.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:   The purpose of this Sources Sought Request/Request for Information is to gather information from interested parties and determine market interest from prospective vendors on providing financial management software testing/benchmarking strategies that minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, and improve the quality of software to the Federal agencies.  The Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) seeks to identify responsible potential sources of support and obtain information about methods, including new alternative process approaches, for testing and certifying financial management system (FMS) software for compliance with federal financial system requirements.  Support also is sought in performing other study and analysis tasks related to improving government wide financial management performance.                     RESTRICTION ON CONTRACTOR ACTIVITIES:  (1)  The Contractor who performs the work shall be prohibited for a reasonable period of time from providing core financial systems software on the Financial Management Systems Software (FMSS) Program.  (2)  Performance of this effort will not preclude the Contractor from participating as a support service provider under the Financial Management Systems Software (FMSS) Program.  However, the Contractor shall be precluded from providing FMSS certified software packages or support related to such packages.   See FAR 9.505.  In addition, the offeror must disclose in its response all affiliations (e.g. partnerships, reseller agreements, etc.) with vendors providing Financial Management Services hardware and software.                    DESCRIPTION:      OMB Circular A-127 requires federal agency financial management systems to conform to the requirements defined by the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of the Treasury, and other central agencies and published by the JFMIP in the Federal Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR).  A-127 further requires that federal agencies replacing core financial management system software must do so using software that has been ?benchmarked? as complying with the requirements.  The JFMIP is responsible for managing the testing process.  In this role, the JFMIP is responsible for maintaining the database of requirements and related tests, reviewing applications for the test, gathering information from the vendors on the financial management software, administering the test, and communicating with the federal agency community.  The core financial system stands at the center of agency financial systems and must interface with other financial systems that are critical to acquiring information and managing financial resources and program delivery.  These other systems, listed below, are not included under the current benchmarking process.  
-- Personnel and Payroll;    -- Inventory;     -- Travel;    -- Property Management;    -- Seized and Forfeited Assets;    Acquisition;    -- Direct Loans;    -- Revenue;    -- Guaranteed Loans	--Budget Formulation;    -- Benefit Payments;    -- Managerial Cost Accounting;    -- Insurance Claims;    -- Financial Reporting;    -- Grants;    -- Framework.---------                                                                       
DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT JFMIP CORE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM QUALIFICATION TEST PROCESS:                                                                                         This test is comprised of a set-up phase followed by a series of cycles containing financial transactions and standard outputs to demonstrate posting effects and reporting capabilities of the tested software.  The test is conducted at the vendor site. JFMIP observes the entry of transactions, reviews the system output files and reports, and determines if the test has been successfully passed. Vendors successfully passing the test receive a certificate issued by the JFMIP signifying that its product has met the currently published requirements. An FMS product cannot be acquired by a federal agency without this certification.  Certificates are valid for three years.

<SUBJECT>USJFCOM RE-ENGINEERING OF THE JOINT DEPLOYMENT PROCESS
<DESC>This synopsis is a modification to the Special Notice issued on 10 Feb 2003 under reference number N00140-03-RFI-DPLY.  That announcement was a Request for Information. In addition to the information provided in the  10 February 2003 RFI, the following information is provided: The To Be documentation published with the original RFI was done in 1998 with a few updates since.  It envisioned a streamlined process using a mature single master database in a concurrent collaborative environment.  The blue cloud in the diagram is an illustrative example of the collaborative environment.  Mapping the concept was as far as Department of Defense got although some of the concepts matured beyond where they were and are actually being used (mostly piecemeal) currently in the deployment process.  Some of the elements/attributes of this old To Be are still accurate, but USJFCOM  is not bound to any of them.  USJFCOM does not necessarily want to implement what is defined there, but actually are willing to start from a blank sheet and design a new process from scratch or at least see what that would look like.  The documents were given with the RFI as a frame of reference, not necessarily a starting point.  Also, USJFCOM is curious to take a more contractor/commercial industry view of these processes as opposed to the way the original To Be was done.  This is a fresh approach asking for fresh thinking.  The documents are only meant to convey a sense of context for the process. The response date is hereby extended to 28 Feb 2003.

<SUBJECT>VBA A-76 Property Management Services Tentative Award Decision
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) tentatively decided that operations and management of the Veterans Affairs Benefit (VBA) Property Management Services) would be contracted out.  The contractor's proposal was selected to streamline and reduce the costs of the property management services rather than the government's Most Effective Organization's (MEO) proposal.  The tentative decision was made after a detailed study of offerors indicated that Ocwen Federal Saving Bank, of West Palm Beach, Florida was more cost effective was determined to be the best overall value.  In addition the contractor's proposal presented a proposal that was projected to yield a net savings of approximately 15 percent less for the contracted period (including option years over the government's "Most Efficient Organization").  This announcement culminates nearly two years of public-private competition using the guidelines of Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities."  VA announced for A-76 study on April 27, 2001 (reference 101-09-01). The competition process established federal policy for deciding whether to retain recurring, commercial-like activities within the government, or contract them out to a private sector source. The guidance tells how to compare performance and cost related information to arrive at the best overall value for the taxpayer.  Following this tentative award decision announcement is a twenty-day period for appeal, protest and review of documents, which will require a minimum of thirty-days before a final award decision is made.  After a final award decision has been made an final announcement will be posted to inform the public of the official awardee.  PLEASE DIRECT ALL QUESTION PERTAINING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER:  jessica.thrasher-wilson@mail.va.gov or 202-345-3311.
