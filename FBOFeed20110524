<DESC>LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL

Contracting Activity:  ESC/HGK                       200 East Moore Drive                       MAFB-Gunter Annex AL 36114-3000Program Name (and Program Element, if applicable):  Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS)Type Program:  Other Contracting Authority:  FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)  
ESC/HGGK and ESC/HGGI propose to execute a new award for ECSS ERP Sustainment Cost and Potential Cost Efficiencies against a Gartner, Incorporated Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) as a firm-fixed price contract.  This requirement is to obtain objective, benchmarked research information to identify areas for program sustainment cost reductions and efficiencies.  Additionally, the offeror shall validate the sustainment costs (to include staffing requirements) are consistent with benchmarked companies.  
This will be a performance-based requirement.  Under the contemplated contract, Gartner, Inc. will provide the following services in support of ECSS Sustainment using industry benchmarking data and industry best practices:	1.	 Review the ECSS sustainment cost figures and validate whether the planned costs are consistent with benchmarked data and industry best practices.2.	Identify possible cost efficiencies to drive down total cost of ownership.  	FAR 8.405-6 requires an ordering activity to justify its actions when restricting consideration of schedule contractors to fewer than required in FAR 8.405-1 or 8.405-2.  The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6 (a)(2).
The item is peculiar to one manufacturer.  A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer.  This brand name justification is based on the fact that the research requested to meet this requirement requires a highly specialized capability.  ECSS is a large-scale commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) enterprise resource planning (ERP) information technology system.  A program of this size and scope requires accurate cost estimates for sustainment and must ensure effective and efficient operations during sustainment to ensure the lowest cost of ownership at minimal risk.
To obtain valid, accurate cost estimates and to identify potential for cost savings requires benchmarking other companies with global mission and scale comparable to ECSS who have implemented a similar technical solution.

<DESC>LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL

Contracting Activity:  ESC/HGK200 East Moore DriveMAFB-Gunter Annex AL 36114-3000Program Name (and Program Element, if applicable):  Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS)Type Program:  Other Contracting Authority:  FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)  
ESC/HGGK and ESC/HGGI propose to execute a new award for ECSS ERP Sustainment Cost and Potential Cost Efficiencies against a Gartner, Incorporated Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) as a firm-fixed price contract.  This requirement is to obtain objective, benchmarked research information to identify areas for program sustainment cost reductions and efficiencies.  Additionally, the offeror shall validate the sustainment costs (to include staffing requirements) are consistent with benchmarked companies.  
This will be a performance-based requirement.  Under the contemplated contract, Gartner, Inc. will provide the following services in support of ECSS Sustainment using industry benchmarking data and industry best practices:	1.	 Review the ECSS sustainment cost figures and validate whether the planned costs are consistent with benchmarked data and industry best practices.2.	Identify possible cost efficiencies to drive down total cost of ownership.  	FAR 8.405-6 requires an ordering activity to justify its actions when restricting consideration of schedule contractors to fewer than required in FAR 8.405-1 or 8.405-2.  The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6 (a)(2).
The item is peculiar to one manufacturer.  A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer.  This brand name justification is based on the fact that the research requested to meet this requirement requires a highly specialized capability.  ECSS is a large-scale commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) enterprise resource planning (ERP) information technology system.  A program of this size and scope requires accurate cost estimates for sustainment and must ensure effective and efficient operations during sustainment to ensure the lowest cost of ownership at minimal risk.
To obtain valid, accurate cost estimates and to identify potential for cost savings requires benchmarking other companies with global mission and scale comparable to ECSS who have implemented a similar technical solution.  Due to the competitive nature of ERP solutions across commercial and governmental organizations, accurate, reliable and comparative benchmarking data is only available from Gartner, Inc.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a sole source contract to the American College of Emergency Physicians, Emergency Medicine Foundation, 1125 Executive Circle, Irving, Texas 75038 for the acquisition of Guidelines for Use of Opioid Analgesics for Acute or Chronic Pain in Emergency Departments.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months.<br /><br />The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) is the oldest and largest organization representing Emergency Departments (ED) physicians in the U.S. and it alone yields the influence, expertise, and recognition within the emergency medical field to develop and disseminate such guidelines. Established in 1968, ACEP has over 28,000 members and publishes the Annals of Emergency Medicine, the most cited and impactful emergency medicine journal. More importantly, ACEP is uniquely qualified to draft, review, and disseminate the kinds of guidelines with the authority and credibility needed by practitioners in EDs across the country.<br />&nbsp;
<p>ACEP follows an established, rigorous process to develop accurate and timely evidence-based clinical guidelines for ED physicians. After ACEP's Board of Directors approves a topic for clinical policy development, a subcommittee composed of experts in the topic area develops the key questions and the guidelines will seek to answer and performs a meticulous literature review. Subcommittee members evaluate every article used to form the clinical policy, classifying the sources by the strength of their evidence and grading the articles on six dimensions considered the most relevant to the development of clinical guidelines. Before publication, ACEP solicits comments from its Board, Council Officers, and a reputable network of expert reviewers. Once approved, the guidelines are published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine and placed on ACEP's website, where they are viewable by non-members. Even after publication, ACEP periodically reviews guidelines to ensure they remain accurate.</p>
<p>A different organization will not be able to attract the leading experts on the topic to participate in the expert panel. Additionally, any guidelines generated by another source will not have sufficient credibility to make them a standard of care in emergency departments. As a result, emergency departments will be much less likely to adopt the guidelines if they are not generated by ACEP; thus CDC will have much less impact upon this health problem.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the American College of Emergency Physicians, Emergency Medicine Foundation. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-Q-13327 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 19, 2011.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity contract on as as-needed basis to furnish all labor, services, equipment, materials, and supplies for land surveys in support of U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service resource management programs in the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Hawaii, and in Pacific island territories.  This support includes: boundary, topographic, control, and water rights surveying, which may involve research, field work, mapping, preparation of legal descriptions and tract reports, preparation and processing of tentative maps and applications for land division approval, calculation of volumes and quantities, recording of surveys, plats and monument records, boundary marking, posting and maintenance, and other incidental services.
Requirement is open to any size business within the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho or Hawaii.  Applicable NAICS Code is 541370.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is 4.5 million annually.
The Service intends to award one contract in each of 4 geographic zones (see exhibit) that have been identified within the four states covered by this contract.  The zones are delineated by county boundaries, and have been designed to include both major concentrations of USFWS facilities and the nearest urban areas.  In this way, it is expected that the costs of per diem and travel are minimized and local experience is maximized, while creating a large competitive pool. 
All successful IDIQ contract awardees shall be guaranteed a minimum of $5,000 for the full IDIQ contract performance period.  This guarantee insures that a contractor will receive a minimum of $5,000 if no task orders should ever be issued. Once task orders have been issued and the minimum $5,000 is met however, those monies will be deobligated from the IDIQ contract. 
Other Federal Agencies shall be allowed to utilize these IDIQ contracts.  The average annual monetary amount issued against previous IDIQ contracts have been anywhere from $0 to $80,000.00 per year.
Contractors must have a survey office located within the zone for which they wish to be considered.  A "survey office" is an office from which survey crews are ordinarily dispatched by the land surveyor in responsible charge of the work being performed.  This requirement does not prevent the contractor from utilizing crews and resources from other offices for any projects assigned under this contract.  One firm may be awarded a contract in more than one zone, but the contractor is required is required to maintain a survey office within the zone(s) for which they are selected.  Partnerships may be utilized to provide multiple survey offices within individual zones.
Projects located within the zone will normally be assigned to the contractor for that geographic zone, although work may be assigned to other firms, other government agencies, or performed by FWS employees. Work outside the designated zones will be assigned to a contractor based on certain qualifying factors, as determined by the Service.  
The contract will be issued on a yearly basis, with one base year and the possibility of four one-year extensions.  The base year will be for Fiscal Year 2012 (from contract award through September 30, 2012), with optional years running from October 1, 2012 through September 30 2016. All work performed under the contract will be governed by the general Technical Specifications. Task Orders will be issued for individual projects, and will contain a Statement of Work that gives the project location and specific requirements. The number and size of individual task orders actually issued is dependent upon priority and availability of funds.
All work performed under this contract will be performed under the responsible charge of a Licensed Land Surveyor, and at least one person in the organization must possess a valid Land Surveyor license issued by each state or states within which the geographic zone falls. In addition the following certificates or licenses will be required:
Oregon:  At least one person in the organization must possess a Certified Water Rights Examiner certification.Hawaii:  At least one person in the organization must possess a Land Court Surveyor certification. 
In addition, for firms in the Eastern Washington & Eastern Oregon zone, Idaho licensure is desirable.  
Submission of Proposal
Interested firms should submit proposals to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, ABA/ CGS 911 NE 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181.  The solicitation is anticipated to be posted within 15 days and the proposal submission due date will be thirty days from the actual issuance date of the solicitation.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for 2.5/3D Woven Nextel panels constructed w/Nextel 6101500 denier fiber in 3 ft lengths in a modified layer to layer architecture.NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Textile Engineering & Manufacturing ofWoonsocket, RI.  The statutory authority  permitting other than full and open competitionis 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or serviceswill satisfy agency requirements.  We request that TEAM (Textile Engineering & Manufacturing) weave layer to layer clothusing 1500 denier N610 (Nextel) oxide fiber. They have demonstrated to NASA that they canfabricate the required architecture in a 12.5 width (to be delivered in 3 ft. longsections.  In a  previous contracted effort performed during the past 9 months	for NASAGlenn allowed TEAM to provide NASA with this weave construction. We have verified thisweave has the required high fiber loading (approximately 35% fiber loading, before heattreatment), with significant through-thickness fiber reinforcement to help increaseinterlaminar properties and impact resistance. They achieved high fiber loading whileminimizing damage to the fibers.  This is very critical.  This weave was also selected toallow us to obtain CMCs with a relatively smooth surface (where other 3D architecturessuch as orthogonal weaves are known to provide rough composite surfaces).  TEAMsdemonstration of the ability to fabricate this weave eliminates the large risk associatedwith a vendor attempting to fabricate a 2.5/3D preform for the first time. We arepurchasing this specific weave because this is the architecture we are currentlyinvestigating in a NASA aeronautics project, where we need to make more composite sampleswith this specific fiber architecture, to allow us to gather more data to add to dataobtained from testing other identical composites reinforced with the same type of cloth(previously purchased by NASA).  For these reasons, we feel that TEAM is the onlysuitable vendor for preparing these specific weaves. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon June 6, 2011.

<DESC>The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract on a competitive basis for the planning, coordination, management, and conduct of a series of laboratory studies that lead to the development and dissemination of AOAC International (AOAC) Official Methods of Analysis (OMA) (http://www.aoac.org/vmeth/oma_program.htm). The OMA are needed in the study of dietary supplements, are recognized in courts of law, are often developed for regulatory purposes, and serve to create consensus standards that promote international trade.
<p>The main objective of the contract will be to provide the ODS, NIH and its stakeholders with accurate, reliable, practical, validated, and published chemical analytical methods for selected dietary supplements as directed by the ODS and informed by the AOAC process. The ODS envisions the simultaneous development, optimization, and validation of multiple analytical methods coordinated by the Contractor and guided by a stakeholder informed method prioritization process through the AOAC. The number and type of validation studies will depend on available resources, public health priorities, and the AOAC committee's recommended priorities.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct, support, and/or provide oversight for development, optimization, single-laboratory validation, multiple laboratory validation, and collaborative study of analytical methods for quantitative determination of constituents in a variety of dietary supplement raw materials and finished products. The Contractor shall adhere to the policies, guidelines, and procedures of the AOAC OMA program. The Contractor shall possess institutional knowledge and facilities to both conduct and oversee all aspects of the work. The ODS expects the Contractor to have the environment, resources, experience, and expertise to develop, optimize, and validate methods within its own facility; that is, the facility must include a laboratory suitable for conducting validation studies. In addition, the Contractor shall subcontract with other laboratories for the performance of collaborative studies, as needed. Therefore, the Contractor may establish a comprehensive overarching organization which subcontracts specific activities to other institutions.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL (RFP). A RFP WILL BE AVAILABLE ON OR ABOUT June 8, 2011, ON THE FEDBIZOPPS (FBO) WEBSITE AT HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<a href="mailto:joyce.a.hines.civ@mail.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command-Rock Island (ACC-RI) is conducting a market survey of industry to identify actual/potential sources that exhibit the capability to manufacture and supply RDX, HMX, DNAN, NTO, and TATB based explosives. As an indicator of your qualifications, a respondent to this market survey must be able to demonstrate that they have adequate technical and manufacturing capacity, and acceptable past performance, in processing RDX, HMX, DNAN, NTO, and TATB explosive compositions and/or similar explosive material(s).  A respondent to this market survey needs to have available the majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture this item, in a facility located within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB).  To meet the NTIB requirement the production of explosives must be accomplished within the boundaries of the United States or its territories, or in Canada.  Subsequent to receipt of responses to this sources sought notification and analysis of all information submitted, it is contemplated that a solicitation would be issued for a 5-year Requirements contract, restricting consideration of offers in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(3)/FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i) to those submitted by NTIB sources.  Interested companies who feel they have the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the Government the following information by 24 Jun 2011: a summary of the company's capabilities; description of facilities, personnel and related manufacturing experience; estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities, with associated lead times for deliveries of RDX, HMX, DNAN, NTO, and/or TATB based explosive compositions; whether RDX, HMX, DNAN, NTO and/or TATB explosives are in production or when they were last produced; other explosive materials produced.  If the respondent does not currently have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc...) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate the ability to obtain those resources in a timely manner.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier sources or subcontractors, those vendors and subcontractors must also meet these criteria.  A respondent's available production capacity must be sufficient to manufacture/supply military grade RDX, HMX, DNAN, NTO, and TATB based explosives for a total of 4M to 7M Lbs annually.  The respondent shall indicate top level processes used to include acid production, handling, and recycling.  The respondent shall also indicate the ability to surge above the 7M pounds annually.  The point of contact for technical questions/issues is Mr. Kevin Blake, (309)782-2532 Email: kevin.c.blake4.civ@mail.mil or for contract questions/issues the POC is Ms. Joyce Hines, (309)782-5227 Email:joyce.a.hines.civ@mail.mil.  Additional Information:  This market survey has been released for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal, or as any other obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research to include information received in response to this notice, or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  The Government will utilize the information provided for planning purposes only.  All information submitted will be afforded appropriate protections as proprietary to the respondent.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is conducting a sources sought in the effort to identify qualified small businesses that are capable of providing induction brazing equipment.The qualifying NAICS code is 333992, and the related size standard is 500 employees. Induction brazing equipment is used when two or more materials are joined together by a filler metal that has a lower melting point than the base materials using induction heating. In induction heating, usually ferrous materials are heated rapidly from the electromagnetic field that is created by the alternating current from an induction coil.Common industries utilizing such specialized equipment include:  Automobile Industries, Aerospace engineering, Aviation, Cable and Wire, Forging, Machine Tool, Electrical and Electronics, Rubber and Plastics, Metallurgical Laboratories, Shipbuilding, Tube and Pipe applications.  The vast majority of commercial units are in labs or on assembly lines.   The pending Government requirement is different in that required units must be fully and easily portable so to enable the user to carry the units to remote locations or logistically challenging site.   Examples of some tentative required features per unit include the following:
Unit 1:
	Operate from a 60 Hz source with a supply voltage of 120 Vac (single phase), 208/240 Vac (single phase), or 480 Vac (single or three phase).
	Operating frequency minimum range 10 to 25 kHz or other frequency suitable for joining large copper conductors of a bar type winding that would be used in hydroelectric generator as shown in Figure 1 (typical dimensions of each bar winding 3.000" x 0.750" or smaller).
	Adjustable power output.
	Continuous (100%) duty cycle.
	Minimum ambient operating temperature range of 32-120 degrees Fahrenheit
	Self-tuning (impedance matching) for custom made heads.
	To be used for large hydrogenerator stator winding repair where bar type windings need to be replaced.  Brazing together two bars joined by a series clip with a typical dimensions of each bar  3.000" x 0.750" or smaller (refer to Figure 2; typical)
	Main cable length no less than 30 ft. (9 meters approximately) (source/control to brazing head)	                If necessary, cooling water will be supplied but only by the available water at the jobsite(s) (typical; ambient temperature tap water, not chilled, not filtered).
	The unit must be shippable/portable and rugged enough to withstand repeated freight and truck shipping without incurring damage.
	Training for two personnel will be provided during machine commissioning
	A custom designed head is to be included.  The custom head will be designed to fit in smallest space possible and developed during commissioning/training.
      Brazing Head Design (as follows):	             Brazing head design(s) shall be small enough to work in tight quarters (to be discussed with manufacturer).           Head must be a thin profile to fit between end windings in a generator (refer to Figure 2).           Brazing head/gun must be able to be held/handled by a single person during the brazing operation           Brazing head must be electrically insulated from the work piece in case of accidental contact with part during brazing.

Unit 2
         Operate from a 60 Hz source with a supply voltage of 120 Vac (single phase), 208/240 Vac (single phase), or 480 Vac (single or three phase).
        Operating frequency minimum range 10 to 25 kHz or other frequency suitable for joining copper conductors as shown in Figure 1 (typical dimensions 0.400" x 0.150" or smaller).
        Adjustable power output.
       Continuous (100%) duty cycle.
       Minimum ambient operating temperature range of 32-120 degrees Fahrenheit	       Self-tuning (impedance matching) for custom made heads.
       To be used for large hydrogenerator stator winding repair where ? coil splices are to be performed.
       Brazing together multiple layers of strands (refer to Figure 2; typical)
       Main cable length no less than 16 ft. (5 meters) (source/control to brazing head), but 20-30 ft. is preferred
      If necessary, cooling water will be supplied but only by the available water at the jobsite(s) (typical; ambient temperature tap water, not chilled, not filtered).
      The unit must be shippable/portable and rugged enough to withstand repeated air freight and truck shipping without incurring damage.
      Must be able to braze four copper conductors together (lap joint), each with the average dimensions of 0.400"x0.150" (as shown in Figure 1, typical)
     Training for two personnel will be provided during machine commissioning
     A  custom designed head is to be included:
	T he custom head will be designed to fit in smallest space possible and developed during commissioning/training.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS RFI. <br /><br />The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is currently performing a market survey to determine potential vendors (small or large) to gather information about commercially available solutions that meet the "requirements" outlined below and can provide the functionality of a lawful data intercept collection, analysis, and minimization system for use by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to conduct investigations which involve the legal intercept of electronic communications, and information about electronic communications. <br /><br />Term Note: In the context of this RFI the word "provider" refers to a company offering electronic communication services such as telephone, cellular, internet, email, VOIP, etc. The word "target" is used to reference a single monitored facility or communications identifier such as an IP address, phone number, account number, web site, email address, etc. The word "case" is used to represent a container for multiple "targets" by which the "targets" may be associated with each other, share/deny access, and provide a context for common functionality such as reporting, analysis, and viewing. The term "minimization" refers to the process of determining which intercepted (collected) communications products are relevant to a court ordered ongoing investigation. The term "pertinence" shall be used to refer to the designation of a collected product as pertaining to/or not pertaining to an ongoing investigation or to classify a product as being protected under legal privilege (such as client/attorney).<br /><br />REQUIREMENTS <br /><br />Data Collection and Loading<br />1. Handle streaming cellular (mobile) data feeds <br />a. Handle a single TCP data stream from a provider that contains cellular packet data for multiple numbers ("targets")<br />- Segregate the stream by individual number ("target")<br />- Provide each individual number as a file output (this should allow other vendors to process the files downstream into other viewing or analytical systems)<br />- Ingest and reassemble each file as data input available under its corresponding "target" number<br />b. Perform item 1(a) for multiple providers (one stream for each) in multiple standards including the following <br />- TCP/FTP stream - 3GPP <br />- TCP Stream - T1 IAS <br />- TCP Stream - ETSI <br />- TCP Stream - J STD 025B<br /><br />2. Auto load "known" data files and types from any number of monitored folders into equivalent data containers ("targets") in the application (for example a monitored folder called "JoeSample" will "load" data into a visible container called "JoeSample". Known data files and types include:<br />a. PCAP, CAP, PKT file output from IP collection tools such as "Wildpackets" or "Wire Shark"<br />b. Email (RFC- 822 w/MIME, MAPI, HTML)<br />c. XML data files with agreed upon DTD <br />d. XML metafiles with agreed upon DTD and their associated files<br />e. Delimited text files <br />f. Files generated in item #1 of this document (ETSI, J-STD-25B, etc)<br />All accompanying metadata shall be extracted and persisted with the product for viewing, reporting, analysis, and exporting. This meta data (when available) shall include: <br />g. Mulitiple associated IP addresses (one product to zero, one or many ips)<br />h. Multiple urls (one product to zero, one or many urls)<br />i. Product Date (one to zero or one)<br />j. Product File Name (one to one)<br />k. Product File Size (one to one)<br />l. Associated Files (one product to zero, one or many associated files)<br />m. Product "type" (one product to one product type - examples: EMAIL, IMAGE, WEB PAGE, etc)<br />n. Product Source (Provider or processing method if provider is not known)
<p>**Note: Auto load monitoring shall be continuous or at a very short interval (under a minute)<br /><br />3. Provide for auto-loading and viewing of any files that are associated with a predefined published xml based complex data type (c. and d. in item #2 of this document). As an example the xml data type may include the following fields (attributes and properties) for each file product:<br />a. Mulitiple associated IPS (one product to zero, one or many ips)<br />b. Multiple urls (one product to zero, one or many urls)<br />c. Product Date (one to zero or one)<br />d. Product File Name (one to one)<br />e. Product File Size (one to one)<br />f. Associated Files (one product to zero, one or many associated files)<br />g. Product "type" (one product to one product type - example EMAIL, IMAGE, WEB PAGE, etc)<br />h. Product Source (Provider or processing method)<br />This would allow users to process custom data and produce this data type for loading and viewing as needed without the vendor needing to develop a processer/loader. Reports, analysis, minimization and normal features shall be able to be generated from this data. <br />**Note: This information (a-h) shall be acquired and persisted for all products where it is available<br /><br />4. Allow for "a-la-cart" loading of all files within a folder (or zip file) for viewing, translating, etc.<br /><br />5. Start/Halt auto-loading and/or collection of data based on predefined dates for the monitored "target" <br /><br />6.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 541712 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is 500 employees. <br /><br />The National Institute of Cancer (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), is anticipating to award a 5-year non-competitive contract to Fundacion Inciensa (FUNIN) in Costa Rica to continue follow-up of women enrolled in studies regarding HPV infection and cervical neoplasia among vaccinated and unvaccinated women. This trial follows a large-scale NCI sponsored cohort investigation of women in the Guanacaste province of Costa Rica in which the link between HPV and cervival neoplasia was investigated under a previous NCI contract. This study was highly successful and achieved an overall participation rate of &gt;90% which made it an attractive population to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine development to prevent HPV infections. <br /><br />Since 2004, FUNIN has been recruiting, enrolling, vaccinating and following a subset of these women. The requirements of the new award will permit NCI to evaluate the long-term vaccine effects and will enable evaluation of numerous questions regarding HPV vaccine immunology and the epidemiology of HPV and associated disease. Follow-up will allow for the evaluation of the HPV-16/18 vaccine among women through their early to mid-30s, therefore extending follow-up through the peak years of pre-cancer diagnosis among well-screened women. A more comprehensive evaluation of vaccine impact will therefore be possible, and larger numbers of pre-cancer outcomes (particularly pre-cancers caused by HPV types other than HPV-16/18) will be accrued for the various analyses envisioned. Some of the major activities of the contract include:<br /><br />1) Obtain all other necessary approvals and clearances for the study from the collaborating institutions and appropriate agencies within each community in which the investigation is planned; <br /><br />2) Institute procedures to maximize study participation and retention. These efforts shall include but not be limited to informational campaigns to inform the community about the study, mailings to participants, home visits by outreach workers, provision of transportation to and from the study clinics;<br /><br />3) Assist in the development of forms and materials to be used in the study. This shall include informational brochures, questionnaires, and other study forms;<br /><br />4) Ship and track study materials and biological specimens to the United States. This will include shipments at room temperature and in frozen states;<br /><br />5) Collect data (interviewing, biologic specimen collection and processing);<br /><br />6) Perform active follow-up and monitoring of all participants. Active follow-up of participants shall include at least one visit every two years, and more frequently if clinically indicated;<br /><br />7) Provide for the treatment of minor conditions diagnosed at the time of a clinical examination;<br /><br />8) Maintain quality control and standardization so that appropriate and valid data result can be reported. <br /><br />To be deemed capable of providing the current need for the study the offeror must submit a written capability statement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise: <br /><br />1. Personnel/Experience: <br />a) Proven organizational and past experience in conducting and managing large scale international longitudinal studies involving the recruitment and interview of study participants, the performance of clinical examinations including a pelvic examination and colposcopy, and the collection and processing of varied biological specimens. <br /><br />b) The offeror shall provide the name of the principal investigator, his/her professional qualifications and specific experience as a key investigator in HPV research and possessing sufficient authority to assure access to facilities and records required for the project <br /><br />c) The offeror shall demonstrate that the proposed team and staff have previous successful experience in carrying out the requirements of the services stated herein.
<p><br />2. Facilities: Adequacy of clinical facilities for performing clinical exams, as well as facilities for data entry and management, and for the processing and storage of biospecimens prior to shipment to the United States.</p>
<p>If any responsible source believes it can perform the requirements they may submit their capability statements via email (PDF format; 15 Page Limit, these pages exclude resumes) for consideration by NCI to Seena Ninan, Contracting Officer, at the e-mail address provided by the response date. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>Respondents must include DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZONE, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

Commerce Acquisition Systems Division (CASD)
14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Suite 6060
Washington, DC 20230
This is not a solicitation for proposals

Request for Information for a Acquisition Reporting Tool

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY  Solicitations are not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.  All response and response contents to this RFI will be considered information only and will not be binding on the parties.  Contractors responding to this request will not be obligated to provide the services described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that the costs provided as a result of this request are best estimates only.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government.  

The U.S. Department of Commerce is seeking sources, product capability information and pricing information to support a business case and budget for a new acquisition reporting tool/solution.  The focus of this RFI is to take advantage of advancements in technology while benefiting from competitive industry trends.  

In its current state, the acquisition reporting system is cumbersome and time consuming.  Data must be pulled from various disparate systems in order to respond to diverse, mandated reporting requests.  The acquisition data for the Department of Commerce currently resides in the following systems:

Existing DoC Data Stores Used for Reporting Data
#	Name	Description	Owner	Database
1	C.Request	Census Requisition data	DoC/Census	Oracle
2	C.Request	NOAA Requisition data	DoC/NOAA	Oracle
3	C.Request 	NIST Requisition data	DoC/NIST	Oracle
4	C.Request	OS Requisition data	DoC/OS	Oracle
5	C.Buy	Census Contract data	DoC/Census	Oracle
6	C.Buy	NOAA Contract data	DoC/NOAA	Oracle
7	C.Buy	NIST Contract data	DoC/NIST	Oracle
8	C.Buy	OS Contract data	DoC/OS	Oracle
9	FIDO/FAAPS	DoC Acquisition Planning data	GSA	MS SQL Server
10	CFS	Census Financial data	DoC/Census	Oracle
11	CFS	NOAA Financial data	DoC/NOAA	Oracle
12	CFS	NIST Financial data	DoC/NIST	Oracle
13	CFS	OS Financial data	DoC/OS	Oracle
14	Momentum	PTO Acquisition/Financial data	DoC/PTO	Oracle
15	FPDS-NG	DoC Contract Summary data	GSA	Oracle
16	CCR	DoC Vendor data	GSA	Oracle
17	Bank Card	NOAA Bankcard System	DoC/NOAA	Oracle

NOTE:  Some DoC systems allow for cross-service functionality.  Specifically, NOAA, NIST and OS perform acquisition and financial services for other internal DoC bureaus and for each other.  Therefore, a bureaus acquisition or financial data may contain cross-serviced bureau data too.

Many of the systems used by Commerce do not provide a robust data collection and reporting environment which necessitates the need for a more efficient reporting tool/solution.  Further, several systems are separate and provide further challenges regarding consolidating and collection data from all DoC bureaus.  For example, there are four production instances of C.Buy deployed at Commerce one each for:  the Office of the Secretary (OS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Census Bureau.  The DOT Enterprise Services Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma hosts acquisition data for Census, OS, and NOAA.  DOT provides each bureau with their own environment that includes a separate instance of the C.Buy application and Oracle database.  Although also using C.Buy, NIST operates and maintains a separate instance at their Gaithersburg, MD offices.  Collectively, this means that C.Buy is currently located physically at two locations, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Gaithersburg, Maryland.   In addition, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) employs the Momentum finance and procurement system

. 

The majority of DoC utilizes Oracle-based financial systems.  These systems provide commitment, obligation and payment data.  The Commerce Business Solutions (CBS) Center in Gaithersburg, Maryland maintains the departments Core Financial System (CFS).  This system exchanges financial data with the requisition and contract systems.  The PTO employs Momentum as their financial and procurement system.   Momentum is XML based on their application layer and SQL on their database layer (it does support Oracle).  NTIS has a financial system called Budget, Accounting, and Purchasing System (BAPS) and is Government-owned, off-the-shelf software.  

Like all other government agencies, DoC is required to integrate and exchange certain acquisition data with components of the federal Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).   At a minimum, the reporting tool/solution should be able to query and receive data from FedBizOpps, Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Federal Procurement Data System  Next Generation (FPDS-NG).  

While each bureau's data is currently stored in disparate databases, DoC would like to utilize a single reporting tool solution for collecting, consolidating and reporting data.  The overall objective is to expand and improve the quality and timeliness of reporting efficiency at the Department of Commerce for acquisition and financial data with one reporting tool for all data.  The long-term objective is to include other types of business data (i.e., property, human resource, etc.)    

The various systems at DoC continue to evolve.  It is anticipated that in December 2011, DoC will migrate the current acquisition system (C.Buy) with a new acquisition system called C.Award.  This is also an Oracle based contract writing system that is more tightly coupled and highly integrated with the current DoC requisition system (C.Request).  Therefore, our acquisition reporting tool must be easily configurable to meet the ever changing system needs of the department.

Overall Goal
Expand and improve the quality and timeliness of reporting efficiency with one reporting tool


Objectives:

1.Transform from a reactive acquisition reporting environment to a proactive acquisition reporting environment; a transactional environment to an analytical environment
2.Provide quick start-up, ease-of-use, reduce need for intensive & repeated user training

4.Achieve reporting interface with (NOAA, OS, Census, NIST, PTO) planning, requisition, contract, IAE, and financial systems
5.Measure and track acquisition results and savings
6.Utilize mature, best of breed products
7.Compliant with all federal legislation and mandates

High Level Functional Requirements
1.Utilize current data warehouse technology and reporting tools.
2.Support Interactive Queries. (Ability to select multiple data elements using an ad hoc tool)
3.Provide interactive analysis. (Allow average users the ability to use ad hoc tools without necessarily understanding the data sets)
4.Provide presentation quality, interactive output of all data. (Both onscreen and printable reports of user created tables and/or graphs)
5.Provide consistent data quality no matter what the view of the data.
6.Provide the ability to transform data into useful information that supports ad-hoc and what-if analysis. 
7.Identify historical trend analysis, and provide the ability to slice-and-dice the information to support DOC business practice requirements. (Ability to select specific data elements across multiple fiscal or calendar years)
8.Meets current security requirements as outlined in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 200, Department of Commerce Information Technology Security standards and with NIST Publications 800-37 and 800-53A
9.Web-based software tool
10.Provides accessibility to data utilizing one system from the users desktop

Pricing Information Request:

INSTRUCTIONS:  Please provide pricing information (in thousands of dollars) for each activity by fiscal year.  Pricing data should be provided over the 5 year lifecycle and the out-years should reflect inflation factors as determined by your pricing model.  

Budget planning is for the system implementation to begin in FY 2011 and be complete by FY 2011.  While costs in FY 2011 may include both non-recurring and recurring costs, it is anticipated that FY 2012 and beyond will be only steady state recurring operation and maintenance costs.  

For budget planning we distinguish between non-recurring costs to deploy the system (Implementation Activities) and recurring year-to year costs which represent Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Activities.  You will see some elements such as training in both acquisition and in operations and maintenance.  In this case, training in the acquisition phase is to train the initial workforce on new software, while in the operations and maintenance phase, the concentration is training of new features and hires.  It is important to keep the concept of segregating recurring from non-recurring costs.

Some O&M activities are not performed annually, such as certification and accreditation (a as tri-annual federal requirement) or hardware refresh on a three to five year cycle (depending on your own estimate).  While these are not annual activities, they are considered recurring costs to be reflected in the O&M section because they are not associated directly with deploying the system as opposed to maintaining the system.

Specific pricing information for activities will be considered a rough order of magnitude and should be based on experience with other similar projects and understanding.  It would be most helpful to include estimates along with quality remarks that you would deem to be beneficial in understanding your estimates.  These should be provided in a narrative separate from the spreadsheet in a separate MS Word or Adobe Acrobat document.

Following are the descriptions for the price elements to be completed in the spreadsheet.  Where reference are made to additional requested comments, please do not put these in the spreadsheet, but include them in a separate narrative in a Microsoft Word 2003 (or earlier version) or Adobe Acrobat document.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><strong><br />Project background<br /></strong>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law in March of 2010, established the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) which funds programs designed to educate adolescents on both abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, and at least three adulthood preparation subjects. PREP provides funding to States (which is expected to most often be distributed to sub-awardees) for the replication of evidence-based effective programs or substantial incorporation of elements of effective programs that have been proven on the basis of rigorous scientific research to change behavior, which means delaying sexual activity, increasing condom or contraceptive use for sexually active youth, or reducing pregnancy among youth. PREP is one of multiple efforts at the Federal level to reduce teen pregnancy through the use of evidence-based practices.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project synopsis<br /></strong>Under the Legislative Requirements for Program Support, the Administration for Children and Families/Family and Youth Services Bureau (ACF/FYSB) is to provide Training and Technical Assistance (T&amp;TA), including dissemination of research and information regarding evidence-based models and promising practices, consultation and provision of resources on a broad array of teen pregnancy prevention strategies, including abstinence and contraception, and development of resources and materials to support the grant funded activities of State PREP, Tribal PREP, and community-based PREP projects working to reduce teen pregnancy. T&amp;TA is to also focus on the topics of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), healthy relationships, adolescent development, parent-child communication, educational and career success, financial literacy, and healthy life skills.</p>
<p>The T&amp;TA contract is to provide the State PREP, Tribal PREP and PREP Discretionary grantees and their subawardees with the following supportive services: <br /><br />1) Training and resources intended to enhance the quality of services delivered to youth, to ensure that programs are implemented with fidelity and that adaptations to evidence-based models are appropriate, and to provide grantees with skill sets to effectively impact a reduction in teen pregnancy rates;<br /><br />2) Knowledge dissemination and TA on the latest developments in teen pregnancy prevention and related fields to increase competency in providing programmatic oversight of the grants;<br /><br />3) TA provided individually and in small groups to address areas of need and to ensure successful implementation of programs;<br /><br />4) Monitoring of grantees' programmatic performance to ascertain the status of adherence to the funding opportunity announcement, approved application, and other requirements on an annual basis or as determined by FYSB staff ;<br /><br />5) Annual meeting planning and consultation services to enhance teen pregnancy prevention (TPP) programs and related policies via topical discussions, skills-based learning experiences, and decision-making activities. The Logistical Support is intended to provide for professional, detailed planning and organization of events.</p>
<p>FYSB anticipates that 46 to 52 State PREP grantees, 12 to 15 Tribal PREP grantees, and an undetermined number of PREP Discretionary grantees will utilize services related to annual meetings and T&amp;TA. Additionally, there are 30 State Abstinence Program grantees that will be afforded opportunities to participate in relevant web-based and/or audio conference calls on topics related to abstinence education.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Core tasks<br /></strong>Training and Technical Assistance will involve significant planning and response-to-request training and other relevant subject matter expertise using a planning/implementation/evaluation framework; site visits and virtual meetings (e.g., phone or video-conference); efforts to reduce barriers to using evidence-based programs; the regular provision of technical or scientific information in user-friendly formats; and other proactive efforts to support State and community-based youth-serving organizations to use evidence-based approaches in their work. T&amp;TA will be provided over time and should include proactive follow-up support. Training will primarily be provided through webinars, annual meetings, and regional training. The core tasks for which the contractor will be responsible include those listed above, as well as those associated with the minimum contractor requirements listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement/ information sought<br /></strong>Respondents must provide as part of their response a capability statement demonstrating their ability to provide the services described above as well as addressing the following minimum capabilities:<br /><br />1) Ability to provide TPP T&amp;TA to grantees through several methods, to include phone, email, written materials, and face-to-face consultation. <br /><br />This can be demonstrated through:<br /><br />&nbsp; - Extensive experience and expertise in providing resources and training on teen pregnancy prevention topics such as goal setting/logic models; needs assessment; program management, organization and oversight; evidence-based model implementation strategies; supervision and coaching; fidelity monitoring and continuous quality improvement; sub-awardee involvement; collaboration and stakeholder participation; performance measurement; adulthood preparation subjects; cultural sensitivity and identification of models that work best in servicing special populations of youth who are American Indian, Alaska Native, African American, Hispanic, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; provision of services to youth in special circumstances of pregnancy, parenting, aging out of foster and juvenile justice care settings, runaway, homeless, and living with HIV/AIDS; adolescent development; adolescent reproductive health; program evaluation, domestic violence, effective participant recruitment and retention efforts; pregnant and parenting youth programming; and the use of social and digital media.<br /><br />&nbsp; - Extensive experience and expertise in developing and being a direct provider of distance training in the form of tip sheets, resource guides and webinars on a variety of teen pregnancy prevention topics and the capability to manage the electronic dissemination of the training materials to grantees on a monthly basis, as necessary.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; -&nbsp;Extensive experience and expertise in developing e-learning modules on teen pregnancy prevention topics that will provide an opportunity for grantees to participate in self-paced web courses on a quarterly to semi-annual basis.

<DESC>Construction of Dormitories at Harpers Ferry West Virginia in Support of Customs and Border Protection.<br><br>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br><br>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br><br>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will<br><br> (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br><br>(2) Be consistent with law.<br><br>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br><br>a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<br><br>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br><br>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br><br>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?<br><br>e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?<br><br>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<br><br>g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br><br>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?<br><br>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?<br><br>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Pat Jackson (contract specialist), email address:  patricia.a.jackson3@usace.army.mil no later than 9 June 2011, 2:00 PM (CST).<br>

The Government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures estimated not to exceed $100,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed vendor will conduct groundfish data collection on-board Alaska Dept of Fish &amp; Game's large and small mesh survey and a small mesh survey of Pavlof Bay. The proposed vendor shall collect and deliver quantitative catch and biological data on groundfish, shrimp and invertebrates caught in the 2011 large mesh and small mesh surveys as well as the first segment of the 2012 ADF&amp;G large mesh trawl survey in a manner consistent with survey data collected during the AFSC's Gulf of Alaska (GOA) biennial groundfish trawl surveys and Pavlof Bay surveys. The NMFS and ADF&amp;G conducted a special study in 1997 to develop the necessary comparisons to allow the data collected by the ADF&amp;G survey with NMFS survey data in the assessment of Gulf of Alaska groundfish. These ecological data are required to maintain a time series for tracking the status and trends of important groundfish species. The time series is needed for stock assessments that are used to develop harvest level recommendations for key groundfish species. These data formed the longest continuous annual survey of its type in the North Pacific. The data from this time series have also been instrumental in describing ecological change in the Gulf of Alaska following the 1976 climate regime shift in the North Pacific. This project would continue the survey support provided since 1997. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately July 01, 2011 through June 30, 2012with no option periods. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $7.0M.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency, Procurment Logistics Directorate, Branch 62, (DISA, PLD, PL62), intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Open Text Inc., 275 Frank Tompa Drive, Waterloo, ON, N2L, 0A1, Canada for the purchase of Vigenette Support Maintenance as detailed in the attached document. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies. Only one responsible source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work. This is a specific make and model of Vignette perpetual license and maintenance support. GCSS-J PMO has made a substantial investment in the Vignette software. Vignette software products offer a more collaborative, flexible document management solution. It is highly configurable, increasing the possibility of meeting document management with minimal product customization, suggesting lower schedule risk. Vignette software is integrated with other COTS tools to provide superior service to the war fighter. It would cost more and increase risk due to possibility of a break in service for the system administrators to research and integrate other COTS products into the GCSS-J software architecture and train the personnel. This would cause a severe breach in schedule. Support maintenance is needed to mitigate any software malfunctions that may arise.&nbsp; Since Open Text is the only vendor who can provide the basic and option year pricing which is required,&nbsp;only Open Text's Vignette support maintenance can be purchased. Authorized resellers who can provide the above listed requirements must indicate their written interest by Thursday, 26 May 2011 10:00AM EST. Oral communications are not acceptable. Offerors may send correspondence to the following address: brian.bilenki@disa.mil. The estimated date of award is 31 May 2011. Only authorized resellers for the federal government, for the specific make and model of the required components will be considered for evaluating the determination to issue a sole source purchase order. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 423430.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Eric Thaxton, (757) 574-5371, 129 Andrews St. Langley AFB, VA, eric.thaxton@langley.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.<br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)<br />n. Wide Area Workflow Instructions<br />1. All vendors/contractors must utilize the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system for certification and payment of invoices. Please note that various codes need to be identified on the contract award document (SF 1449) before entering data in the WAWF system. These codes function like zip codes and will route our invoice to the proper destinations for certification and payment. The following is a summary of the codes, (DoDAAC is Department of Defense Activity Address Code).<br />a. CAGE Code - identifies contractor information (may be found in block 17a)</p>
<p>b. Admin/Issued By DoDAAC: FA4890 - identifies the administering Contracting Office - ACC CONS (may be found in block 9, "Issued by").</p>
<p>c. Inspected By/Ship To/Deliver To DoDAAC: F2QF08 - identifies Inspected By &amp; Ship<br />To &amp; Delivery To DoDAACs. Leave the EXT block blank.</p>
<p>d. Pay DoDAAC: F67100 - identifies paying office, DFAS Limestone (may be found in block 18(a), "Payment will be made by").</p>
<p>2. The WAWF system will ask for additional information not previously required for invoicing which includes:<br />a. Inspection/Acceptance Points on the "Create New Document Screen" in WAWF: Mark D for Destination in both Inspection and Acceptance.</p>
<p>b. Shipment Number/Shipment Date: In WAWF under the "Header" tab of the Create New Document Screen you will find a shipment number and shipment date block. We recommend the shipment number entered be sequential beginning with each fiscal year (i.e. invoice for Oct would be shipment 1, invoice for Nov would be shipment 2, and so on) and shipment date may be date of invoice.</p>
<p>c. Stock Number: Type N/A in this space</p>
<p>d. Type: FT (for commodities), SVS (for services), etc</p>
<p>3. Contractors must prepare a combination invoice/receiving report electronically in WAWF. This will enable the invoice to be routed to DFAS at the same time the receiving report is routed to the customer (ACC DP), or as stated in the order for certification.</p>
<p>4. Invoices for cost reimbursable CLINS (i.e. Travel Costs) may also be submitted via WAWF, however, supporting documentation to validate costs billed must be electronically sent to HQ ACC AMIC/PKA and customer stated in Delivery Order.</p>
<p>5. HQ ACC AMIC/PKA will continue to serve as the liaison for payment issues. While we will no longer approve invoices, we will be able to monitor payment actions. Any questions regarding WAWF should first be directed to the Contract Manager or Contracting Officer to be resolved.</p>
<p>6. Contractor shall submit an email notification to the contract manager once an invoice/receiving report has been put into WAWF so that he/she can monitor payment action. After you have completed processing the invoice within WAWF you will be taken to a screen showing who is receiving email notification from WAWF. On this screen you will see a line stating Add Additional Email Notification. This allows you the opportunity to type in an email address. Once you have typed this address the persons name will stay with the contract until completion so you will not have to retype this name each time you input a new invoice. This person will receive an email notification each time you input an invoice against this contract. <br /><br />Contract Manager: Colin Pugh, colin.pugh@langley.af.mil, ph: 757-225-6521</p>
<p><br />Additional Information:</p>
<p>Offerors are required to quote on all line items. Incomplete proposals will not be evaluated for consideration of award.</p>
<p>Additionally, contractors are requested to provide discounts for all items.</p>
<p>Award will be made on a "lowest price technically acceptable" basis.</p>
<p>All questions and concerns shall be directed to both Mr. Colin J. Pugh, (757) 225-6521/colin.pugh@langley.af.mil, and Rhonda R. Foster (757)764-4961 Rhonda.foster@langley.af.mil, and shall be addressed during the solicitation period. Deviations to the specifications will not be considered after the closing date.</p>
<p>After receipt of the award, the vendor shall furnish a copy of the delivery schedule within 2 business days to the Contracting Officer. All items shall be delivered to the various locations within 30 days of award. Each shipping location will be delivered in total of all items ordered and may be invoiced through WAWF at that time.</p>

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />52.252-6, Authorized Deviations in Clauses</p>
<p>(a) The use in this solicitation or contract of any Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" after the date of the clause.<br />(b) The use in this solicitation or contract of any Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (48 CFR Chapter 2) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" after the name of the regulation.<br />L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES<br />In accordance with procedures set forth in AFI 31-101_MWSUP 1 Oct 08:<br />1. Normal Installation Entry. Entry to MAFB requires possession and verification of approved identification credentials. Personnel without valid identification will be referred to the Visitor Control Center (VCC) located at the 2nd Avenue North Gate entrance. People who cannot be properly identified or sponsored will be denied entry.<br />2. Contractor Access: Upon award of a contract, the contractor awarded the contract will be issued a request for a Contractor Entry Authority List (CEAL) by the contract administrator. Upon receipt, the contractor must compile the information required for the CEAL and submit a completed CEAL to the contract administrator. Until this occurs, no employees will be permitted to enter Malmstrom AFB. <br />3. The contracting office approves the list and hand carries it to the Pass and Registration Section (341 SFS/S5B) for review. S5B personnel will compare the approving official's signature against a DD Form 577, Signature Card, or an appropriate letter on file at pass and registration. S5B then hand carries the submission to the 911 Dispatch Center.<br />4. A 911 dispatcher certified on the National Criminal Information Center system (NCIC) will run the contractor names through the NCIC for wants and warrants. The 911Dispatch Center will input all listed employees' names and data into the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) database for a background check in accordance with Air Force directives. Unfavorable results from the background check will result in individuals being denied access to the installation, including, but not limited to, individuals that are determined to fall into one or more of the following categories: those having outstanding wants or warrants, sex offenders, violent offenders, those who are on probation, and those who are in a pre-release program. The definition of sex offender and violent offender can be found at Montana Code Annotated &sect; 46-23-502. After the dispatcher completes the NCIC check, they will sign the letters and return them to S5B. Unfavorable results will be grounds for denial of entry.<br />5. Contractor personnel requesting a contractor pass will provide a picture ID<br />to be verified against the Contractor EAL. Those employees, who clear the background check process, will be issued passes by S5B, located in Building 250, for the duration of the contract or one year, whichever period is shorter. For contracts lasting more than one year, including contract options, renewals and extensions, the contractor must repeat the above stated process on an annual basis. In addition, the process must be initiated for all new employees who are added to the CEAL after its initial submission.<br />6. Contractors are required to notify the contracting officer and S5B if an employee on a CEAL terminates his or her employment with the contractor or is involved in an incident that would result in unfavorable results from the background check including, but not limited to, those identified in paragraph 4 above. If a contractor terminates an employee, it is incumbent upon the contractor to ensure that the employee's access badge is returned to the Pass and Registration office. If they are unable to retrieve the pass, they will contact S5B with the employee's information. S5B will then contact the installation entry control points and have them retrieve the pass if the person attempts to re-enter the base. In the case of a missile field contractor the S5B will contact Keys and Codes Control Center.<br />7. Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are contractor employees must use their contractor's pass when entering Malmstrom AFB for the performance of contract services. Under no circumstance will retired military members or dependents of active duty or retired military members vouch contractor personnel onto the installation utilizing their Armed Forces Identification Card. All DoD contractors who have been issued a Common Access Card will be allowed to sign people onto the installation. <br />8. Violations of the stated entry procedures will be considered a breach of contract and the contracting officer will take appropriate action in accordance with the contract. Repeated or flagrant violations of this policy may result in termination of the contract for default. Contractor/vendor passes are for granting access to the installation for the sole purpose of employment. These passes do not permit access to or usage of government facilities or services (i.e., gym, service station, and dining hall.) However, during contractor/vendor "duty hours," the Burger King, Base Exchange Bowling Alley and Grizzly Bend Club eateries may be utilized.<br />9. Local delivery companies (e.g., food, furniture, appliances) will submit a letter to the 341 SFS Pass and Registration Section containing the name of the company, the driver's name(s), date of birth, driver's license number and vehicle information. All information will be cross-checked against the installation barment and revocation list and the NCIC via the 911 Dispatch Center prior to approval. A copy of the letter will be maintained in the possession of the driver requesting entry. If the driver does not possess a letter, he/she will be directed to the VCC where an AF IMT 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass, will be issued after verification of the delivery has been made through the on-base residence sponsor.<br />10. Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or logo, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base. If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB. This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section. Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration. You or your representative will be required to have insurance coverage on the vehicle to meet Montana State minimum requirement.</p>
<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>
<p>*LPO DoDAACs are used for Navy contracts only.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.   The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.   The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.   To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10.

STATEMENT OF WORK:Tamarisk Leaf Beetle (Biological Control) Monitoring Project Land Management Districts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 (Western Navajo)Land Management Districts 9, 12, and 13 (Northern Navajo)
I.	Background
The goal of the monitoring effort is to determine the value and impacts of the tamarisk biological control agent, the tamarisk leaf beetle, on river systems within the San Juan and Little Colorado River Basin affected by the beetle and to distribute this information to invested land managers and scientists.  
The project proposal is located in the Western Navajo Agency (WNA) and Northern Navajo Agency (NNA) jurisdiction along the major water tributaries to monitor the Tamarisk leaf beetle that is defoliating the Tamarisk leaves.  The biological agent monitoring was initiated by the Tamarisk Coalition to support the local land users on management of invasive species and water resources, http://www.tamariskcoalition.org/tamariskcoalition/index.html.  The objective of the project proposal is to monitor the target species Elaeagnus angustifolia L., and Tamarisk family within San Juan and Little Colorado watershed. The two woody plants are not continuous along the watershed but isolated and patches.  Tamarisk and Russian olives are invasive plants and covered under the current bill, H.R. 2720 and Senate bill S. 177 to control the plants.  
II.	Project Location
The Bureau of Indian Affairs Western Navajo Agency (WNA) & Northern Navajo Agency, Branch of Natural Resources' Noxious Weed Inventory and Control Program is proposing to monitor Tamarisk Biological control along major streams and tributaries along the San Juan River, Colorado River, and Little Colorado River.  The project is located along the drainage Land Management District 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 in Coconino, Apache, San Juan and Navajo Counties of AZ and UT and Land Management District 9, 12, and 13.   The location of the project is entire Western Navajo Agency and Northern Navajo Agency where there is Tamarisk infestation along streams, roads, communities and other land disturbance areas.  
III.	Purpose
The goal of the monitoring effort is to determine the value and impacts of the tamarisk biological control agent, the tamarisk leaf beetle, on river systems within the San Juan and Little Colorado River Basin affected by the beetle and to distribute this information to invested land managers and scientists.  
IV.	Cultural Resource Protection
There are some cultural resources in the monitoring vicinity but there will be minimum disturbances during the Tamarisk biological control monitoring which would lessen the potential of a significant impact.  No heavy equipment will be utilized to disturbed any potential area.
V.	Scope of Work
Project Area Description
The project area is utilized by varies land users from ranches, farmers, residents, recreationalist, wildlife, livestock, and established communities.  The area is infested with Tamarisk and also known as a water source for livestock and wildlife.  The area is located on a trust land where the BIA has the trust responsibility to protect and preserve the natural resources.
Vegetation and Soil
The soil description is available on line for certain areas, AZ711 at USDA NRCS Web Soil Survey http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/HomePage.htm. 
The vegetation description range from galleta, black gama, Indian ricegrass, sand dropseed, blue gama, threeawn, locoweed, globemallow, Mormon tea, broom snakeweed, prickly pear, yucca, buckwheat, Utah juniper, rabbitbrush, Pinyon pine, cheatgrass, Tamarisk, mustard, warm season annual grasses, cool season AAGB, cool season annual forbs, morning glory, wild onion, Russian thistle, spike dropseed, whipple cholla, and other unidentified plant community.  Ecological site description is available online http://esis.sc.egov.usda.gov/Welcome/pgReportLocation.aspx?type=ESD. 
Objective and Methodology
Goals:  The Agency's 2010 monitoring program is part of an ongoing effort, to further support a body of knowledge that will determine the value of the beetle, Diorhabda spp., as a tamarisk biological control agent on six river systems.

Appendix 2:  Map of the Western Navajo Agency showing in detail the Land Management District 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. Appendix 3:  Tamarisk Coalition's Tamarisk Leaf Beetle Monitoring Protocol -2009 - Check the Tamarisk Coalition's website for the most current protocol.  http://www.tamariskcoalition.org/ 
 Tamarisk Leaf Beetle Monitoring Protocol 2009 In general the goal of the biocontrol monitoring protocol is to define when, where, and how many Diorhabda elongata are in existence across the region. Within that we then want to have a good idea of where defoliating sized populations exist, where newly aggregated populations are rising, and where beetles have yet to spread to. This protocol is designed to be fast and efficient and answer only basic questions about D. elongata distribution and abundance. It can be utilized on and off the river and should be a basic protocol for establishing the degree of beetle presence in an area. In general the amount of sweep samples taken within an area can be variable; of course the more sweeps across a region the greater the resolution of our data. It should be best followed that for every 5 sweep sets a GPS point should be taken and data recorded for that location, the more sweep sets the better, but utilize 5 sets as a minimum. 
General Sweep Surveys: Using standard 15" aerial sweep nets and doing ~1 m sweeps; 5 sweep sets will be done per sampling location/GPS point. Per sweep set, 5 sweeps will be done within the tamarisk foliage. After each set of 5 sweeps, the contents of the net will be recorded using defined parameters (Table A). This should be repeated 5 times roughly 5 m away from each previous sweep set. Such that 5 sets of 5 sweeps, each roughly 5 meters apart will be done per sampling location. 
Per sampling location, a GPS point should be recorded along with the attributed data for each sweep set (see Table A). 
If marginal tamarisk is present for sampling, sweep sets should still be done on whatever tamarisk is present. River Surveys: 
During river surveys, sampling locations should be stopped at every 1.5 km. When on land the 5 sets of 5 sweeps protocol (The General Protocol listed above) should be done within roughly 50 m of the landing point (variably 25 m up and downstream). When possible tamarisk off the waterline should be swept, but with efficiency in mind when searching for a tree. 
When no tamarisk is present or inaccessible at the 1.5 km point, float to the next available tamarisk and sweep there. Following, only proceed to the next point that was 1.5 km from the original intended stopping point that was missed. 
In areas when getting off the boat is impossible (overhanging tamarisk/vegetation on both sides), "floating surveys" should incorporate 25 sweeps spread over roughly 50 m of vegetation. Sweeps should be done again in sets of 5 with roughly 5 m between sets, the difference being that the net will only be counted at the end of all 5 sets (i.e. 25 sweeps) rather then counting the contents 5 separate times. Counting: 
When counting net contents take care in not letting beetles escape or fly away when possible. Shaking the net vigorously or tapping the sides can sometimes knock beetles into the bottom of the net aiding in the count. All adult beetles should be counted. 
We have decided to avoid counting sexes though this year, except in certain situations where we believe the data to be worth the time spent. 
Larvae will be counted as either "Early" (1st and 2nd Instars: small & black with no yellow stripe) or "Late" (2nd & 3rd Instars: larger body, with noticeable yellow stripe). Do not worry about fine details dictating Early and Late as it is mostly anecdotal information. 
A quick glance before and during each sweep set for eggs is all that is necessary for answering if eggs are present or absent. Look on the branches for the creamy pink/white egg clusters. This is also very anecdotal information and should not take much time. 
Defoliation will be categorized for each sampling location as the average level of defoliation within the sample location and recorded as "Hi/Med/Lo." We will avoid using percentages, due to observer differences. For the untrained eye, "Lo" will entail mostly green trees, described as frosted, having a slight haze of brown, or very minute patches of defoliation, easily overlooked as un-defoliated. "Hi" will descend from the 100% defoliated trees that look dry, brown and completely dead, to the trees that are roughly 80% brown and nearing a lack of any green foliage. "Med" is the large swath in-between that represent trees bearing a stable amount of green foliage, but also showing distinguishable signs of defoliation. Mind that the bright yellow tinge that tamarisk get mostly late in the fall is Leaf Hopper damage and should not be confused as D. elongata defoliation. In concurrence with defoliation, refoliation should also be recorded. Following similar levels: "Hi/Med/Lo." Refoliation is best noticed by the "fireworks puffs" or "poodle puffs" that are the signature of tamarisk re-sprouting. Leaves will re-sprout out of the sides of branches and trunks. "Lo" will be the presence of these puffs with only a slight recovery over the plant. "Med" will again be more broad, entailing roughly 30-70% of the tree holding newly sprouted vegetation. "Hi" will be roughly 80% or more of the tree greenly foliated. Note that partially defoliated trees may be confused as refoliated, but typically refoliation will not occur until after at least the hatching of the 1st Summer generation of beetles in Mid June- Mid July and should be comparable to non defoliated material as looking greener and healthier. Again observer judgment will have to be involved and extra notes may be needed. 
Data Recording: When sweeping an area 1 GPS point should be taken for every 5 sets of sweeps (or equivalent 25 sweeps) and multiple GPS points can be taken at a site if more intensive sweeping is utilized. Upon taking data at each GPS point, the date and kilometer number (if on a river survey) should be recorded followed by the sweep data and when possible photos of the sweep area should be taken and recorded by their respective ID number. When at all possible, written comments about geographical location, note worthy net samples, or other significant information should also be recorded. Anything is better then nothing.

(a) Definitions.
IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986INA - Immigration and Nationality ActINS - Immigration and Naturalization Service SSA - Social Security AdministrationINS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements ProgramESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
(b) Who is Covered. INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination. These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements. Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer. Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://uscis.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm

(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs. The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program. If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia. The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem. To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature. If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature. To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(e) Employee Rights. The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
(f) Compliance Assistance. More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
(g) Penalties/Sanctions. Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions. As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms. They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment. A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.



At a minimum, responsible soources shall provide the following: (1) A price quote on letterhead for the requested item(s) along with specifications of proposed item; (2) Unit Price and Extended Price; (3) Prompt Payment terms; (4) Remittance address; (5) Duns Number and Taxpayer Identification Number.

SPECIFICATIONS:The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Southeast Idaho National Wildlife Refuge Complex, 4425 Burley Drive Suite A, Chubbuck, ID 83202, has a requirement to purchase native grass seed to re-vegetate, reduce erosion, and to compete with/prevent the establishment of invasive grasses and other noxious and invasive plant species on approximately 640 acres of burned lands on Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge. These acres are at risk of permanent degradation due to fire severity. It is necessary to acquire seed that has the best chance of germinating to achieve rehabilitation goals.  
The native seed required for this project must come from Snake River Plain ecotypes to meet native seed policies of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and program objectives for the Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge. The parameters listed below for native plant materials identify very specific specifications that must be met to achieve these objectives.
DEFINITIONS:  Snake River Plains derived:  documented evidence that the parent plant material originated from or from within the Snake River Plains Ecoregion. 
Snake River Plains Ecoregion:  that area of land and associated plant communities that lie in and around the Snake River in Idaho.
Minidoka:  Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge
Pure live seed (PLS):  Seed tested for purity and germination and seeding rates calculated based upon seed testing so that seed is purchased on basis of pure live seed in the mixture.
Source identified:  Source identified Snake River Plain Genotype native seed, with documentation of the location of the native seed collection site. The source-identified certification insures on-site identification and labeling for quality assurance.  This informs seed buyers of genetic integrity, adaptation, and viability for the intended use. Documentation of "source identified" is important to ensure native seed has:o Adaptation to local soil conditions o Adaptation to local climate including temperature extremes and growing season length. o Prevent non-local genotypes from invading natural areas adjacent to plantings o Assurance that all species are locally native o Preservation of the local genetic material of declining native species 
USFWS:  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Southeast Idaho National Wildlife Refuge Complex

<p>One award will be made.

<p>GENERAL CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS</p>
<p>SCOPE OF CONTRACT<br />It is the purpose of this solicitation to contract for cutting, baling, and stacking approximately 300 tons of hay from 169 acres (7 separate fields) for the Ninemile Ranger District of the US Forest Service for a base plus two option years. The project is located at the Ninemile Ranger Station, 20325 Remount Road, Huson, MT. Swathing will commence on or about July 5, 2011, depending on weather and field readiness. The contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, and supplies necessary to complete this contract. Hay may be baled as large round bales, large square bales, or small square bales,--contractor's choice.</p>
<p>General Requirements</p>
<p>(a) The work consists of seven blocks totaling an estimated 169 acres in section 8, T15N, R22W. All blocks are located within &frac34; mile radius of Ninemile Ranger Station. The blocks consist of approximately 30, 25, 12, 18, 37, 7 and 40 acres. The areas contain an estimated 300 tons of hay.<br />(b) The blocks are bounded by irrigation ditches, irrigation mainlines, and/or fences. The work areas are accessible by Missoula County Road Number 393.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements</p>
<p>(a) Timelines - Haying operations are always subject to suitable weather conditions. The Forest Service will notify the contractor as to when haying operations can begin. Unless otherwise approved by the Forest Service, the Contractor shall be on site, ready to start work within three days (72 hours) of notification. The Contractor and Forest Service will keep informed on current and projected weather patterns. The goal will always be to put the hay up in top condition (i.e. no rain with appropriate drying time between swathing and baling). Normal contract start date is on, or within two weeks of July 5th.<br />(b) Swathing and conditioning - Hay shall be cut with a maximum stubble height of 3-4 inches. The maximum stubble height may be altered when ground conditions warrant as approved by the Forest Service. At no time shall any more hay be cut than can be baled within the immediate 24 hour period.<br />(c) Turning and/or raking - As necessary, or at the specific request of the Forest Service, the hay shall be turned to facilitate drying to prevent spoilage and "burning" or mold in the bale. Light windrows may be raked together to facilitate building a better bale. The exact time for turning and/or raking operations will be determined by weather and ground conditions and will be mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and the Forest Service.<br />(d) Baling - Exact times for baling operations to begin shall be mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and the Forest Service. Once hay has been cut, baling shall commence as soon as hay is properly cured, generally within 48 hours. Baling shall be kept current with cutting, with no more hay cut and ready to bale than can be baled in two days.<br />(e) Hay may be baled in large round bales, large square bales, or small square bales. <br />Large Round Bales: Round bales may be either net wrapped or string wrapped. Net wrapped bales must be wrapped a minimum of two full turns. The net wrap must cover the entire length of the bale and the wrap and bale structure must be tight. String wrapped bales must be baled and tied tight. The string must wrap the full length of the bale.</p>
<p>Large Square Bales: Knot-strength for all large square bales shall exceed 400 PSI. Load pressure greater than 300 PSI is required on 4'x4'x8' bales. Load pressure on 3'x3'x8' bales and 3'x4'x8' bales shall be a minimum of 160 PSI. Bale pressure shall range between 1300 and 1800 PSI and bales shall produce an average of 40 flakes per bale.</p>
<p>Small Square Bales: Small Square bales shall have a minimum length of 40" and a maximum length of 46". Average bale weight shall be 70 - 80 pounds, and bale string knot strength shall be a minimum of 170 pounds.</p>
<p>(f) Inspection of bales - The seven hayfield blocks will be inspected individually. In each field 3-6 bales will be selected by the Contractor and Forest Service Representative and the bales will be weighed by the Forest Service on a Forest Service approved scale. Unless otherwise approved, all large bales must weigh a minimum of 1100 pounds and a maximum of 1600 pounds. Bales will be tested with a Forest Service provided moisture meter, moisture readings shall be less than 14%.<br />(g) Bale pickup and stacking - Bales will be picked up by the Contractor and stacked in barns/areas as designated by the Forest Service. Bale pickup shall be kept current, (within two days of baling). All bales that are broken in the baling and/or pickup process shall be re-baled. Stacks shall be uniform and tight. All toppled bales shall be restacked by the contractor.<br />(h) Any structures damaged by the contractors operation such as fences, gates, barns, irrigation system, etc., shall be repaired by the contractor.<br />(i) All known field mowing obstructions (i.e. ditches, stumps, irrigation heads, etc.) will be flagged, marked, or pointed out to the Contractor by the Forest Service before cutting commences. Perimeter fences and cross fencing will not be considered obstructions to mowing equipment.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance</p>
<p>(a) Acceptance of work will be determined by inspection of each block and will be based on adherence to the requirements.</p>
<p>Measurement and Payment</p>
<p>(a) Payment in full will be made at the completion of the job.<br />(b) Upon completion and acceptance, the Contractor will be paid according to the prompt payment act at the price per acre for swathing, raking, baling, bale pickup, and bale stacking, multiplied by the total acreage completed (maximum 169 acres).</p>
<p>Site Visit</p>
<p>(a) No formal site visit is planned for this solicitation. However, Contractors are urged and expected to visit the hayfields and stacking areas where the work is to be performed to satisfy themselves regarding all local and general conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.<br />(b) Contractors may contact Marc Haskins (406) 626-5426 or Bob Hoverson (406) 626-5409 at Ninemile Ranger Station for general information or to coordinate a visit to the site.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
This is a total small business set aside under NAICS:  334112 and PSC D399.
Items being requested are:
Two (2) - One fault tolerant flash (FTF) card, used with active spare feature.Two (2) - ActiveSpare firmware feature that enables destination of one FTF Card as an active spare.One (1) - One day/ one person advanced solutions group - Installation and configuration as it pertained to RAIDOne (1) - 24x7x365 with 4 hour on-site (1 year) when purchased hardware and software together for 12 months.
The SX-T0 allows you to designate one of the cards inside the system as an Active Spare that works hand-in-hand with the chip level RAID on each of our boards. If one of the cards experiences a chip failure that degrades its RAID protection, the system will immediately migrate the data on that card to the hot-spare to return to a fully redundant state. At that point, the degraded card will be inactive and can be swapped during the next scheduled maintenance downtime. Having the active-spare means that a faulty card can be swapped in a matter of minutes without the need to migrate all data off and back on to the SX-T0.

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:


        Lowest price, technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate for this award as the best    
        value. 
        
      a) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY

      Technical capability will be determined solely by submission of a quote. By submission of a 
       quote the offeror certifies compliance with all specifications. 


            b) PAST PERFORMANCE

            An offerors past performance information will be used to make a determination of whether the 
            offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance. Provide performance history and reference 
            for three (3) prior, similar contracts performed within the past three years.
 Past performance 
            information should be provided on the attached Contractor Performance Evaluation Survey. A 
            copy should be sent to your customers meeting the criteria stated above. Please ask them to 
            submit a completed copy directly to Sarah Nickerson at sarah.nickerson@navy.mil. In the event 
            of non-Federal Government contracts then state, local, or commercial contracts should be 
            evaluated in that order. Offerors shall ensure the past performance information requested is 
            submitted in the required timeframe or shall affirmatively state that it does not possess relevant 
            past performance information.
 In such cases, the offerors quote will be eliminated from the 
            competition. The Government reserves the right to contact previous customers and to obtain 
            additional past performance information as necessary to evaluate offerors past performance. The 
            assessment of the Offerors past performance will be used as a measure of performance risk for 
            this contract award. The assessment of the offers past performance will be used as a means of 
            evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the 
            requirements of this RFQ. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the 
            Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

            (c) PRICE - The contract resulting from this RFQ will be awarded to the responsible offeror 
            submitting a technically acceptable offer, having acceptable past performance, and the lowest 
            evaluated price.


             (d)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful     
                  offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without 
                  further action by either party.
 Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an 
                  offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of 
                  withdrawal is received before award.

<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>Technical Capability: Offerors will be evaluated on their demonstrated understanding of the performance work statement and proposed methods for meeting the performance requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Technical capability also has four "go/no-go" subfactors. Failure to meet the requirements of these subfactors may result in an offerors proposal being deemed technical unacceptable. The subfactors are as follows:<br />a) Evidence of an Occupational Health and Safety program addressing the requirements of 29 CFR 1915 as it relates to hydroblasting<br />b) An SSPC QP-1 Certification <br />c) An SSPC Coating Inspector Certification<br />d) Evidence of ownership, or the ability to rent/lease, the following equipment:<br />a.

Power Tools including but not limited to needle guns, scalers, and sanders to perform coating removals where water jetting is inaccessible.</p>
<p>Key Personnel: The contractor shall be evaluated by their proposed key personnel in their ability to meet the minimum criteria as designated in section 1.5.12 of the performance work statement:<br />a) On site supervisors shall have, at a minimum, 36 months of marine coatings removal experience. <br />b) Designated personnel in the area of repair and maintenance of the water blasting equipment shall have a minimum of 12 months experience in the same field.</p>
<p>Contractors that propose personnel with less than the minimum experience shall be deemed technically unacceptable. Contractors that propose personnel with more than the minimum level of experience will be evaluated higher.</p>
<p>Quality Control: The contractor will be evaluated on the way that their quality control plan addresses inspection, deficiencies in performance, and proposed methods for correcting deficiencies in performance prior to the level of performance becoming unacceptable.</p>
<p>Past Performance: Past performance will be evaluated based on the following:<br />(a) Quality of service, timeliness of performance, including adherence to contract schedules and other time-sensitive project conditions, and effectiveness of home and field office management to make prompt decisions and ensure efficient operation of tasks.<br />(b) Customer satisfaction, including satisfactory business relationship to clients, initiation and management of several complex activities simultaneously, prompt and satisfactory correction of problems, and cooperative attitude in resolving clients' problems.<br />(c) Track record of key personnel including effectiveness and appropriateness of personnel for the job and prompt and satisfactory changes in personnel when necessary.</p>
<p>The government may give more weight to past performance information that is considered more relevant and/or more current. In cases where an offeror lacks relevant past performance history, or in which information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. The "neutral" rating provided to any offeror lacking relevant past performance history is at the contracting officer's discretion based on the past performance ratings for all other offerors. Prior to assigning a "neutral" past performance rating, the contracting officer may take into account a broad range of information related to an offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>Price: Vendors will complete the attached contract line item matrix for all services. Pricing shall be inclusive all costs associated with performance of each contract line item, including, but not limited to any mobilization costs, containment costs, associated rental costs, and demobilization costs after completion of each line item.

<a href="mailto:tejae.craig@conus.army.mil">MICC Center - YPG</a>
<DESC>Amendment 0001 - This amendment is issued to post questions/answers from industry.<br><br>1. Question: Could you please provide payment history for the past 12 month period on the following?<br> 	Roll/off on/call service<br> 	Contaminated Soil Roll/off Service on~call <br> 	Special Call-out Service for 5-cubic yard bins <br> 	Special call out service for Roll/off boxes <br> 	Base Monthly Rate for all front loader bin service<br><br>Answer:  Current payment history is proprietary information and cannot be disclosed.<br><br>2. Question: If a "Small Business" subs to a "Large Business", is there a minimum percentage of work that must be performed on a regular basis by both entities? <br><br>Answer:  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14(b)(1) Limitations on Subcontracting, Services (except construction).  "At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."<br><br>3. Question: If a "Small Business" subs to a "Large Business" and the "Small Business" has no past experience in this type of service will they be evaluated on just the "Large Business" sub?<br><br>Answer:  Potential offerors to include their subcontractors must provide past performance details in accordance with the solicitation requirements and will be evaluated in accordance with the basis for award.   A prime contractor is allowed to use a subcontractor's past performance details.<br><br>4. Question: The current bid specifications indicate all 5-cubic yard front loader bins. The current contractor does not have this equipment on site; in fact there is a mixture of 3,4,5, and 6 yard bins at the various sites at YPG. Should the current contractor (or their Small Business Sub) be successful, will these bins be replaced with the specified 5-cubic yard bins win the bid? Must it be accomplished within the "phase/in" period of June 17th to June 30th? <br><br>Answer: 5 yard dumpsters are the required standard. There are a few locations i.e. ammo locations, where it is easier for the contractor's dock dumping to have a different size. The variable-sized bins were already in place prior to the current contract. There are also a few 8 yard dumpsters at a maintenance facility because of the amount and size of debris.<br><br>5. Question: It is apparent that the existing bins onsite are not cleaned per the current bid specifications. Is this requirement in the current contract and is it being performed per your specifications?<br><br>Answer: The Government has found that cleaning the bins with cold water at the wash facility is non-productive as cold water does not clean a soiled crusty bin effectively.  It was agreed with the current contractor, prior to commencing full performance of the contract that bins should be swapped out with fresh bins instead of cleaning using a non-productive process. However, the option is there if needed. <br><br>6. Question: On the bid due date or thereafter, will you have a public bid opening and if so, please inform us of this time and place?<br><br>Answer:  A public bid opening applies only to a sealed bidding process (See FAR Part 14) and is therefore not applicable to this acquisition.  Successful and unsuccessful offerors will be notified by letter of the award once the information has been approved for release.  <br><br>7. Question: The current bid specifications indicate that all dumpsters are to be painted annually. Is that in the existing contract because there are multiple different colors of tan in place now, which do not appear to have been painted annually? 	<br><br>Answer:   Please see Paragraph C.1.1 of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) which states that "All 5yard dumpsters shall be painted in sand stone beige in color."   The current variation in beige tones can be attributable to the color codes in the different brands of paint used.  In addition, some bins appear to be lighter in color as they are bleached by the sun very quickly within a 3 month period of having been painted.<br><br>8. Question: What will the contractors obligation to tires and HHW (Household Hazardous Wastes) be?<br><br>Answer: If there are tires found in the landfill the landfill operator removes them for proper disposal and to date this has never been an issue. The maintenance shops that carry out the management and disposal of tires simply allow them to accumulate and then dispose of them using an alternate contractor. There is no knowledge of household hazardous waste and if there were, there would be no way for the contractor to determine what is in their receptacle unless they were to pick through the trash. <br><br>9. Question: What is the contractor's obligation to special and medical waste?<br><br>Answer: There has been no red bagged hazardous medical waste disposed of in a regular dumpster. To date there has been nothing reported by either the landfill operator or current contractor regarding medical waste. Medical facilities at YPG have their own processes for disposal of medical waste to include sharps containers etc. and therefore this has never been an issue.<br><br>10. Are special wastes such as contaminated soils and asbestos to be removed from the base for disposal by the contractor?<br><br>Answer: Contaminated soils are disposed of at Copper Mountain once the HAZMART on YPG has had the soils tested. If it is not contaminated it is disposed of at the YPG landfill.  The majority of contaminated soils that require disposal are as a result of fuel spills.  The soils are then tested and disposed of at Copper Mountain once HAZMART informs the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to "pull" to Copper Mountain.  A service order will be submitted for the "pull." Asbestos is the responsibility of the asbestos contractor or the general contractor renovating a building. <br><br>11. What is the procedure for flooding and weather related incidents (i.e. shutdowns and closures)?<br><br>Answer: YPG is ordered to vacate when flooding occurs, and the contractor will be notified to vacate by the COR. The refuse contractor cannot continue to work if the landfill operator has been ordered to vacate as the landfill will then be closed. <br><br>12.Question: Will companies whose primary NAICS code is not waste related and past performance is limited, be eligible to subcontract out or partner with other businesses who primary is waste? <br><br>Answer:  This requirement is being solicited as a 100% small business set-aside. Small businesses must fall under NAICS code 562111 "Solid Waste," however; they do not have to have it listed as their primary NAICS. This code must be registered under the firm's information in the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR).  <br> <br>13. Question: Are companies with limited past performance eligible to be awarded this contract?<br> <br>Answer:  Yes, companies can still be eligible for award.  However, offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a  "Neutral" rating for the Past Performance factor.<br><br><br>

<DESC><strong>I.	General Instructions </strong><br /><br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-51.  <br /><br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Leadership Coaching Program (LCP) has a requirement for contractor support to provide the LCP management team with staff assistance and a cadre of certified, professionally trained, and TS/SCI-level cleared executive coaches to work in partnership with NGA&rsquo;s  Human Development Recruitment Services Career Development Division (HDRC).  The overarching goal of the LCP is to support the mission through enhanced leadership effectiveness.   This requirement is solicited as a Full and Open Competition and competed solely through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov).  The associated contract clauses and Performance Work Statement are included with this synopsis/solicitation.   <br /><br /><br />Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the best value to the Government.  The Government may select other than the lowest proposed cost/price proposal or other than the highest technically rated proposal.  The Government may select a superior technical/management offer if it is determined that the additional merit offered is worth the additional cost in relation to the other proposals received.  All vendors interested in submitting a proposal for consideration should do so, prior to the solicitation closing date, in the form of an email, to the Points of Contact listed in this solicitation.  All submissions should be in accordance with the stipulations set forth below:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;	The proposal shall be clear and concise and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation.  The Offeror should not simply rephrase or restate the Government&rsquo;s requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements.  The Offeror should assume the Government has no prior knowledge of its capabilities and experience, and the Government will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror&rsquo;s proposal.  <br /><br /><br />&bull;	Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed artwork, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired.  <br /><br /><br />&bull;	The proposal package must be received by the date and time specified in Block 8 on Page 1 of this RFP. Submissions should not contain attachments greater than 5MB in size.  Larger documents may be sent in more than one attachment.  <br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Proposals shall be submitted to Lora Mackin at lora.l.mackin@nga.mil and to Judith Hart at hartj@nga.mil no later than 3 June 2011, 1600 hours EST. </strong></span><br /><br /><br /><strong></strong><br /><br /><strong>Contracting Office Address:</strong> <br />Attn: ACH/MS S84-ACH 7500 GEOINT DRIVE Springfield,VA 22150  <br /><br /><strong>Primary Point of Contact:</strong> Lora Mackin at lora.l.mackin@nga.mil <br /><br /><strong>Secondary Point of Contact:</strong> Judith Hart at hartj@nga.mil  <br /><br /><strong>NGA Website:</strong> www.NGA.mil

General Instructions</strong>
<p>1.0 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-48. <br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a requirement for Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop managed services. This requirement is solicited as a Full and Open Competition and competed solely through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov). The associated contract clauses and statement of work are included with this synopsis/solicitation are provided with this solicitation. <br /><br />All vendors interested in submitting a proposal for consideration should do so, prior to the solicitation closing date, in the form of an email to the point of contact listed in this solicitation. All submissions should be in accordance with the stipulations set forth below: <br /><br />1.1 The proposal shall be clear and concise and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation. The Offeror should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements. The Offeror should assume the Government has no prior knowledge of its capabilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's proposal.<br /><br />1.2 Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed artwork, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired. <br /><br />1.3 The proposal packages must be received on the date and time specified in Block 8 on Page 1 of this RFP. Submissions should not contain attachments greater then 5MB in size. Such submissions may be excluded. <strong>Proposals shall be submitted to Scott Stallsmith at scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than June 6, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time.<br /></strong><br />1.4 Proposals submitted after the time and date specified for receipt of the RFP will be considered LATE in accordance with FAR 52.215-1 (JAN 2004), Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition. <br /><br />1.5 Written requests for clarification may be sent to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at the title of the e-mail must include "URHD QUESTION". The content of a question may be included in a notification or answer to all Offerors, but if so included will not divulge the source of the question. All questions and answers will be posted on the FedBizOpps website prior to the closing date of the RFP. <strong>All questions need to be submitted to scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than June 1, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time. <br /></strong><br />1.6 Small Business Subcontracting Plan<br />Each Large Business Offeror shall provide a Small Business Subcontracting Plan that contains all the elements required by FAR 52.219-9 Alt III (July 2010). This plan shall be submitted separately from the Small Business Participation Approach information required below, which applies to both large and small businesses. An approved Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not a requirement for evaluation in source selection, but rather a requirement for award to a large business and will be incorporated into any resultant contract.<br /><br />1.7 Proposal shall be based on open market pricing. <br /><br />1.8 The government will make award based on a Best Value Trade-off analysis on the submitted proposals. <br /><br />1.9 All offerors must either be registered on the ORCA website or submit a completed version of the Offeror Representations and Certifications (please see Section 6.0 of this RFP). <br /><br /><strong>1.10 Identify in your proposal any particular security restrictions, deliverables, or any other URHD requirements in the SOW or other associated attachments that would restrict implementation of the Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop here in NGA.<br /></strong><br /><strong>II. General Information</strong></p>
<p>1.0 Prospective offerors are cautioned against contacting other Government personnel in regard to this solicitation prior to award. Prospective Offerors are also cautioned to advise potential subcontractors or teaming contractors of this instruction. If such contact occurs and is found too prejudicial to competing Offerors, the Offeror (including subcontractors or teaming partners) making such contact may be excluded from award consideration. Only responses from the Contracting Officer in writing shall be considered for purposes of this procurement.</p>
<p>The Government will use the data and information gathered in the course of this pilot to determine the feasibility of SaaS, Computing to Go Service Models, and Public/Private Cloud Computing for NGA. If this proof of concept is successful, NGA intends to procure these services agency-wide through a competitive acquisition. As such, pursuant to DFARS 227.7202-1(c)(1), the Service Provider is required to provide deliverables detailing changes to or within the Government's hardware and software systems with Government Purpose Rights, as defined in DFARS Clause 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014. This will enable NGA to provide potential vendors in the follow-on competitive procurement with the information necessary for modifying the Government system to enable these services through any commercial vendor.</p>
<p>If the Service Provider wishes to assert more restrictive rights than Government Purpose Rights in any deliverable or part thereof, it shall do so in accordance with DFARS Clause 252.227-7017. Any Government requests to validate asserted restrictions will be done in accordance with the procedures in DFARS Clause 252.227-7019.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Special Notice - Special Use of Contractor Support </strong></p>
<p>a. The Government will use MITRE personnel for administrative, technical, and price analysis support during source selection. The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government. Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C. 423) (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") as implemented in the FAR. MITRE personnel are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information. Contractor personnel assisting in the proposal evaluation are procurement officials within the meaning of the Act, and will take all necessary action to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a competing Contractor's proprietary data. Non-Disclosure and Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificates for all contractor support personnel participating in this source selection are on file at the respective contracting activities.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.0 Restrictions of Briefings </strong></p>
<p>During the period of source selection, which begins with release of this Request for Proposal (RFP) and ends with contract award, briefings by potential Offerors to Government agencies on the subject matter of this RFP are inappropriate. Conducting such a briefing without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer may be justification for eliminating your company from further consideration under this RFP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ITEMS and ITEMS - Pilots Background Information<br /></span><br /></strong>NGA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency that provides Geospatial-Intelligence to both the DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC). NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate Geospatial-Intelligence in support of National Security. The Director of NGA is the functional manager for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG), which is the combination of people, technology, policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities and community necessary to produce Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) in an integrated multi-intelligence environment to support National Security Strategy objectives.</p>
<p>NGA is looking to change how the agency procures and provisions Information Technology in order to meet expanding mission requirements given budgetary constraints. NGA plans on implementing a managed services model that decreases complexity, increases agility, enhances reliability, while improving efficiency and effectiveness of IT delivery in support of the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). NGA intends to implement these services under the consolidated Information Technology Enterprise Managed Services (ITEMS) program. In order to position the agency for successful implementation of this program, NGA is currently executing risk reduction activities and intends to award several pilots as part of these activities. The purpose of the pilot activities is to explore commercially available technologies for application in NGA facilities as well as external sites. The four pilots being contemplated are Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop (URHD) pilot, Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot, User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot, and Deployed Services (DS) pilot.</p>
<p>The URHD pilot will explore the use of a commercial Cloud as an alternative to in-house solutions. The outcome of this pilot is to determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity at a commodity price; free up one-third of data center floor space for other uses; flatten recapitalization spikes; provide efficiencies that will free up other IT resources for repurposing toward mission; and provide 24 x 7 access to voice, email, data and cloud applications via Personal Information Technology Devices (PITDs), Smart Phones, etc. NGA expects that the pilot will drive out policy concerns and solutions.</p>
<p>The Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot will explore a flexible, on-demand alternative to standard government owned data centers. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity to provide parallel operations that allows thin client transition; parallel dissemination operations; on-demand flexible capacity to allow rapid provisioning of it services; and benefit from the elimination of expensive facility modifications in limited data center space.</p>
<p>The User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot will explore flexible, on-demand alternatives to government owned user-facing hardware. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: eliminate need for multiple thin-clients at the desktop; modern, flexible, user-facing hardware; replacement or augmentation of voice and video services; and implementation of mobile thin-client devices.</p>
<p>The Deployed Services (DS) pilot will explore flexible, cross-security domain collaboration capabilities. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: deployed personnel collaboration capability for use by deployed personnel in crisis; CONUS and OCONUS situations; and a deployed PITD capability, regardless of whether an existing cell phone network exists.</p>
<p>These four pilots form an integrated architecture that mirrors the ITEMS operational objective architecture, albeit at a reduced capability and scope. By demonstrating this reduced architecture, NGA will gain high confidence in the feasibility of implementing the ITEMS approach, and detailed knowledge of how to structure the enterprise ITEMS acquisition.</p>

<p>B. OBJECTIVES<br />The long-term strength of this agency as a high performing organization is critically linked to our frontline leaders. For an organization our size, our frontline leaders are critical to the organization's ability to be nimble and successful. This training conference is intended to improve the delivery of our Government Contracting and Business Development programs. <br />The goals of this conference are:</p>
<p>1. To provide a level understanding among all BDS' regarding the significant program changes that become effective during FY 2011 and FY 2012; <br />2. To establish and train BDS' on standard documents, processes and systems that are pertinent to delivering SBA's government contracting programs; and <br />3. To give BDS' the skills to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse within SBA's government contracting programs.</p>
<p>C. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The SBA Business Development Specialist Training Conference is aimed at SBA's Business Development Specialists, supervisors, and senior leaders from the Office of Capital Access and Office of Field Operations. The conference will consist of a series of lectures, presentations, training sessions, interactive breakout sessions, and sharing of ideas, best practices and lessons learned.</p>
<p>A small preparatory group will arrive on Sunday, June 26th. They will need to have a pre-conference meeting with the facility staff and a tour of the facility on the morning of Monday, June 27th. The remaining large contingent of the conference attendees will arrive throughout the day of Monday, June 27th. Attendees will be arriving from the entire United States.</p>
<p>Hotel staff will have conference rooms and all hotel provided equipment setup no later than 7:00 am each morning of the training event as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. This includes any hotel provided audio-visual equipment.</p>
<p>On the first day of the training event (Tuesday June 28th), the hotel's audio-visual technician will be available from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm to assist SBA's presenters with their personal audio-visual equipment setup.

Daily, during the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, hotel's audio-visual staff must be available to provide technical support within 30 minutes of the hotel being notified by SBA's presenters or on-site representative.</p>
<p>SBA's lead contact and on-site representative for all training events is Ms. Susan Nassaux, Field Operations Specialist. Ms. Nassaux may provide additional SBA on-site representatives who may be serving as alternate Agency on-site representatives for specific training events during the performance period.</p>
<p>D. HOTEL LOCATION, QUALITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS<br />The conference space will be used as a training classroom. This will require one large banquet room with unobstructed interior views large enough for various training room configurations/setups (classroom, U-shape, circles, etc) to comfortably accommodate approximately 300 participants. Likewise, SBA may need a second smaller work room to comfortably accommodate approximately 15-20 participants. At a minimum, both rooms must be Internet accessible and may require standard audio-visual presentation equipment (LCD projectors, microphones/lavalieres, projector screen (or 60" or larger LED/LCD/HD TV screen), connection cables, power cords) technical support and setup available for training presenters. Conference rooms and audio-visual equipment must be reserved solely for SBA for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>In order to meet SBA requirements, all conference and meeting spaces must be contiguous or in very close proximity (line of sight preferred) to each other. The banquet room space, where the General Sessions will be held will be the main focus of the conference; therefore, the space shall be visually appealing.

All program space must be blocked for the sole use of SBA for the duration of the conference.

Guest rooms must be provided at a rate at or below the Government approved rate of $132/night. A list of attendees will be provided at the time of contract award to create the reservations. The entire event including guest rooms will be contracted and invoiced against as a single contract. Attendees will furnish a credit card at check-in for incidentals and personal expenses only. Two upgraded guest rooms are requested to be provided at the Government approved rate of $132/night and must be large enough to accommodate small informal meetings of 10-12 people. The total estimated number of guest rooms needed per night is:</p>
<p>Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of Rooms</p>

<p>The hotel shall guarantee SBA participants' guest room reservations and rates for five business days prior to scheduled event.</p>
<p>Due to the Agency's mission to be able to provide immediate support to America's small business community on a moment's notice, SBA requires flexibility in its ability to change the number of participants' guest rooms reserved. SBA will guarantee 85% occupancy rate of its participants' guest room without penalty.</p>
<p>Hotel on-site parking available to accommodate 20 participants' vehicles at no additional charge.</p>
<p>A hotel airport shuttle service is preferred; however if no shuttle service is provided, the hotel will provide information on other airport transportation options.</p>

SBA's training schedule will indicate planned meal hours. SBA's on-site representative will confirm meal plan hour with hotel's representative at least one week prior to training start date. However, due to the nature of training, the parties anticipate the need to have some reasonable flexibility in actual meal schedules as not to disrupt the training.</p>

With 300 conference attendees arriving at the property at one time, hotel must have a plan/staff to have check-in/check-out move quickly and efficiently.

SBA may require the front desk to hand out an informational welcome flyer to the attendees upon check-in. Express check-out via guestroom TV or under guestroom door invoicing is desired.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, hotel will provide SBA's on-site representatives a telephone directory of "key" hotel personnel assigned to supporting SBA during the conference. The telephone directory must include "key" personnel's business hours and telephone numbers (note a telephone answering service is not acceptable). At a minimum, the key personnel must be identified for check-in/out, guest room accommodations, audio-visual support, meal services, and conference room setup.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in the notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>This is a Request for Quotes (RFQ) and is 100% set aside for small businesses. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the procurement is 333415 and the Small Business size standard is 750 employees. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center Contracting Office, has a requirement for six (6) 400,000 pound compression spacer load cell for 3.250 inch diameter and six (6) 500,000 pound compression spacer load cell for 3.750 inch diameter (to include shipping). FOB is destination. Desired delivery is 60 days after receipt of order. This is for purchase and delivery only and not installation.<br><br>Additional Information:<br><br>The load cells will be outdoors in continuous operation on a lock gate in the central US.  The air temp will dip occasionally to well below 0  F. requiring a low temperature operating limit of -30 F.  In normal operation the load cells will not be submerged. However, in periods of high water that usually occur with spring floods, they may be submersed for extended periods of time to a depth of up to 20 feet.  They are required to operate under these conditions.  It should be noted that submergence and freezing temperatures are mutually exclusive conditions and the load cells will not be subject to simultaneous submergence and sub-zero temperatures.   <br><br>This solicitation is for two sizes of compression spacer type load cells.  They are called load spacers because these devices are placed over a threaded rod between a base plate and a capping nut and washer.  When tension in the rod increases the load cell is compressed between washer/nut and base plate. The two rod diameters that will "pass through" the load cell are 3.25" and 3.75" respectively, this each load cell will be build according. This type of load cell is sometimes referred to as a "load washer.  When the load cell is compressed strain in the steel produces a proportional change in resistance of internally bonded strain gages that is thus proportional to the applied load. The relevant details, specifications, and a concept drawing are provided in the "Additional Documentation" section of the solicitation.  All critical dimensions are clearly stated on page 2 of the attachment.  Also as specified, all exposed surfaces are to be Nickel plated for maximum corrosion protection. <br><br>Specifications for compression spacer load cells - Please see attachments<br><br>All interested firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx) and Online Representations and Certification Application (https://orca.bpn.gov/).

<DESC>SEMI-ACTIVE LASER (SAL) SEEKER REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <br />
<p>(***This is an active solicitation.&nbsp; RFI-AAC-PKESXR-SALS04182011 was&nbsp;cancelled in error.&nbsp; This solicitation is effectively the same as the aforementioned solicitation.***)<br /><br />Synopsis:</p>
<p>I. Description</p>
<p>The USAF Air Armament Center Capabilities Integration Directorate (AAC/XR) Intra-Theater/Close-Control Strike Integrated Product Team (IPT) is requesting information on SAL seekers for use in guidance packages for a variety of air-to-ground weapons. This information will assist Air Force decision makers in evaluating existing, modified, and new air-delivered weapons for potential use given cost, effectiveness, platform load-out, and logistical constraints.</p>
<p><br />II. Background</p>
<p>LASER-guided weapons were first developed by the Air Force in the late 1960's. Since then, a myriad of SAL seekers, with a variety of physical properties and capabilities, have been developed and employed. AAC/XR is attempting to re-baseline the state of the art for SAL seekers looking for potential incorporation into a variety of air-to-ground weapons.</p>
<p>III. Technical Objectives</p>
<p>Identified SAL systems should be at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or greater. Our interest ranges from stand-alone, single-aperture systems to distributed-aperture systems intended to leave internal volume for other functions. Seeker diameter can range from 1 inch to 6 inches. System identification should include the following information:</p>
<p>Dimensions<br />Weight<br />Power Required<br />Aperture Type (e.g. Distributed or Single)<br />Gimbaled or Strapdown<br />Optics (if integral)<br />Linear Field of View (LFOV)<br />Angular Accuracy in the LFOV<br />Field of Regard (FOR), Ungimbaled <br />Field of Regard (FOR), Gimbaled <br />LASER Energy (at the aperture) Range of Operation (min detection to saturation, X to Y millijoules)<br />Sensitivity at a range of 5 Km<br />Operating Temperature Range<br />Sensitivity over Temperature Range<br />Dynamic Threshold<br />Instantaneous Dynamic Range<br />LASER Code Input (type, input method)<br />Technology Readiness Level (TRL)<br />Approximate Cost per unit for quantity buys of 10, 100, and 1,000</p>
<p><br />IV. Government Information</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs of charges by the Government will arise due to contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government may issue an RFP after reviewing the information submitted in response to this RFI. Contractors that do not submit information in response to this announcement will not be precluded from submitting a proposal to any subsequent RFP. However, any acquisition strategy will be defined based on the information submitted in response to this RFI, so maximum participation is highly encouraged. AAC/XR uses Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contractors to fulfill its mission requirements and to review technology capabilities solicited in this RFI. Service contracts contain an organizational conflict-of-interest clause that requires service contractors to protect the data and prohibits them from using the data for any purpose other than for which it was presented. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort. The information provided may be utilized by the Department of Defense in developing its acquisition strategy, including creation of Initial Capabilities Documents. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a formal RFP, and should not be construed as such as a commitment by the U.S. Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, and subject to modification.</p>
<p><br />V. Responses</p>
<p>The information submitted should include the general characteristics identified under section III, Technical Objectives. Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts with the Government that support the desired capabilities described. Respondents may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. Any subsequent actions resulting from the evaluation of the information provided because of this RFI may be synopsized at a future date. Responses to this RFI may be classified. Classified responses should be properly marked and packaged. For instructions on submitting classified information, contact: Christine Wicker at (850) 883-4925 or christine.wicker@eglin.af.mil.

<p><br />**AMENDMENT 0001 ISSUED 20 MAY 11**<br /><br /><br /><br />All questions regarding this notice are to be submitted in writing via E-mail or Fax.</p>
<p><br />Q&amp;A:</p>
<p>Q) In T.O. 6J15-13-11-3, the note under Chapter 8.1 references a hydraulic motor which is to be removed from the fuel flow proportioner (pump) prior to servicing and testing of the proportioner. My question is whether or not this hydraulic motor (governed by TO 6J15-13-12-3) is required to be included in the workscope for the subject solicitation.</p>
<p>A) Only NSN 2915-01-147-2644RK is to be overhauled/remanufactured on this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) If we are not to overhaul the motor and the motor is not operational we are not required to replace the motor or fix the motor as part of the scope of work?</p>
<p>A)&nbsp; The Motor, hydraulic should&nbsp;be removed before the Pump, Fuel, Metering is shipped for overhual/remanufacture.&nbsp; However, if Pump, Fuel,Metering (2915-01-147-2644RK) is received with Motor, Hydraulic (1650-01-568-1044), contractor shall remove Motor, Hydraulic and request disposition instructions from Production Management Specialist. "IAW the SDR process in the PWS". This language will be incorporated into the PWS via solicitation amendment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) Pertaining to the solicitation/contract, the Bidder/Offeror is required to complete blocks 11, 13, 15, 21, 22, &amp; 27. In the same block that lists these requirements, there is a letter "J" provided. To what does this pertain? Section "J"?</p>
<p>A) The letter J in this block (located at the top of page 1) indicates the pricing type. In this instance, the pricing type is Firm-Fixed-Priced.</p>
<p><br />Q) Also pertaining to the solicitation/contract, in Section B are Items 0002 and 0003 to be negotiated after contract award based on Items 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC?</p>
<p>A) Item 0003, Data, is Not Separately Priced (NSP). Any costs associated with this item should be included in item 0001. Item 0002, Over and Above, will be negotiated on an as needed basis after award.</p>
<p><br />Q) Do discounts for prompt payment need to be addressed in this bid due May 23, at 4PM or is this an item that will be negotiated at a later date?</p>
<p>A) The prompt payment discount should be included in&nbsp;the offer. See FAR clauses 52.232-8 and 52.232-25 for additional details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) The "Total Evaluated Price" is defined on page 35 of 35 of the solicitation as including the "basic requirement (item 0001AA) and all options (items 0001AB and AC) plus other associated factors such as: first article testing cost, transportation cost, price evaluation adjustments for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns, and application of labor hours to labor hour rates, etc." Do all of these "other associated factors" need to be addressed in the bid which is due May 23 at 4PM or will they be negotiated at a later date?</p>
<p>A) Any applicable "other associated factors" should be included in&nbsp;the offer since they are a part of the price evaluation factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Q) On the solicitation contract in block 13, a contractor offeror code and a facility code are requested. What are these and where might we obtain them?</p>
<p>A) The contractor offeror code is the cage code of the specific offeror responding to the solicitation. The facility code is only required if the actual work is to be performed at a facility other than the one associated with the offeror code. Your cage code can be found at http://bpn.gov/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In Section B Item No. 0001 what does "Other than high value item" mean in regards to Limitation of Liability?</p>
<p>A) This indicates the applicable Limitation of Liability FAR clause for that item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In Section B Item No. 0001 what does PACRN and PAA mean?</p>
<p>A) PACRN is a Packaging Reference Number. The PACRN is a 3-position code that identifies the packaging information for a specific line item or delivery item (i.e. PAA). The PACRN will cross reference the applicability in the Line Item Schedule to the packaging clauses (for example see section D, Packaging and Marking).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) During overhaul/remanufacture of a subject Fuel Flow Proportioner, please confirm the contractor is required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price given for Item Nos. 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC and up to the BER threshold of 75% of the stock price.</p>
<p>If a unit's remanufacture/overhaul cost exceeds the BER threshold (75% of stock price), is the contractor required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price given for Item Nos. 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC?</p>
<p>A) Both the Appendix A/PWS and solicitation discuss what to do in the event an item is considered BER. Additionally, regardless of whether an item is BER or not, the contractor is required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price unless Over and Above is deemed to be acceptable. See the Appendix A/PWS and solicitation for additional details on Over and Above work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In block 5 of the Solicitation/Contract, the Solicitation Type is listed as "Negotiated." Other than submittal of the signed Solicitation/Contract and all other required documents, will an opportunity for discussion be provided prior to contract award?</p>
<p>A) Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award address discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In TO 6J15-13-11-3 in the Introduction Section page iii/iv under paragraph 4. Repair Kits., the first two sentences read "Some repair parts for the component covered in this manual are provided in the form of a kit. The Illustrated Parts Breakdown identifies these parts." However, we have not found an itemization of the parts contained within the kit is listed by PN 81503-1 in the MPL, but no further identification is provided. Please provide the components of this kit.</p>
<p>A) This parts list can be requested.&nbsp; Please follow the same procedures as if requesting a T.O.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Q) [It was previously] indicated that only the proportioner NSN 2915-01-147-2644 is to be overhauled by this solicitation and not the hydraulic motor or, as I understand it, the assembly PN 60957. To this end, what other and/or attaching parts need not be addressed in the overhaul of the proportioner? As an example, the solicitation requires 100% replacement of, among other parts, Figure 10 &amp; Index 3, PN M25988/1-135 packing, but this packing is at the same indentation level as the proportioner itself. In other words, if we are to receive, overhaul, and test only the proportioner (utilizing a slave hydraulic motor), we will not be able to install this packing since it goes between the proportioner and hydraulic motor.</p>
<p>A) T.O. 33DA36-88-1 Operation and Maintenance Instructions; Fuel Flow Proportioner Test Stand, has the requirements to test the Proportioner. The O ring can be changed as per T.O. 33DA36-88-1. (i.e. Put a new O ring on when you put the Fuel Flow Proportioner on the slave hydraulic motor.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Q) Is the stock list price of $13,123.08, listed in Item No. 0001, the government price for a new proportioner?</p>
<p>A) The stock list price (SLP) is the price we have on record for what a new proportioner would cost. See page 3of the solicitation for additional information regarding the SLP.</p>

<DESC><p><br />UPDATE 24 May 2011</p>
<p>The release of the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the SORTIES effort has been delayed. The government has revised the acquisition schedule and currently intends to issue RFP, FA2550-11-R-8000, on or before 16 June 2011. The planned periods of performance are unchanged. Please continue to monitor this website in the event the Government is able to release the RFP earlier than 16 June.</p>
<p>PDATE 30 Mar 2011 - Presolicitation Notice</p>
<p>The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, intends to award a contract to procure program management, systems engineering and technical support to ensure continuity of effort and support the 50th Space Wing Plans and Programs Office (50 SW/XP) planning and programming personnel. The contract will be firm-fixed price (FFP) with a Base Period of 1 Sep 11 - 30 Sep 11 plus four (4) one-year option periods, each with a performance period from 1 Oct to 30 Sep of the respective option period. Option Period 1 will be exercised at time of contract award.</p>
<p>Services to be provided by this requirement include, but are not limited to the following: Mission Sustainment and Future Program Planning, Requirements Development and Integration of Mission Support Equipment, 50 SW Satellite and Command and Control (C2) Systems Integration, Wing Operational Requirements Development and Coordination, Wing Operational Plan Development, Wing Host/Tenant Base Planning and Integration, and Beddown, and Wing Compliance and Self-Inspection Program (SIP) Support. This requirement will provide scientific and engineering technical services to the 50 SW/XP. The 50 SW/XP Office is chartered to provide future planning to support the 50th Space Wing (50 SW) mission and for 50 SW bases and units and acts as the Wing's "front door" providing initial and continuing support to external agencies. The term "front door" means the 50 SW/XP office is the single point of entry, the only source, into the 50 SW for requests for any future planning support requirements. The 50 SW/XP also provides requirements validation, system integration and planning support for Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), satellite command and control systems and 50 SW users. The contractor shall provide support to all aspects of 50 SW/XP operations.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This synopsis is to make available a notice of proposed contract action as required by FAR 5.201. The government intends to issue a Request for Proposals, FA2550-11-R-8000, on or before 22 April 2011. This acquisition is set aside 100 percent for small business, with no specific subcategory targeted. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 - Engineering Services, with a $27M size standard.</p>
<p>For planning purposes, a revised DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached. Interested potential offerors should note that major changes to the PWS include elimination of the requirement for a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), elimination of a requirement for GWAN/CWAN capabilities, and removal of Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development requirements. Interested potential offerors should review the entire PWS for other changes. Please note, this is a DRAFT PWS, and the Government reserves the right to make further changes. However, the Government is confident there will be no further significant changes prior to issuing the Request for Proposals.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program management office or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman can be reached at HQ AFSPC/A7K, 719-554-5250.</p>
<p><br />UPDATE 11 Mar 2011</p>
<p>As part of the acquisition planning process, an Initial Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Analysis has been conducted by the Contracting Officer. As a result of this analysis, the Government has identified several areas of the SORTIES requirement which could potentially be areas for OCI concerns. Attached is a "Memorandum for Potential Interested Offerors" dated 11 March 2011. Interested parties should review that memorandum. Although the final acquisition strategy has not yet been approved, the Contracting Officer intends to request that all offerors provide an OCI analysis and mitigation plan, to include the items discussed in the memorandum as part of their proposals. This memorandum is published for planning purposes only and IS NOT a request for proposal or a request for any other information from industry at this time.</p>

The date responses are due is amended to read "NOT LATER THAN Tuesday, May 10, 2011, 12:00 p.m. (EDT)"  The deadline for questions related to this RFI are due not later than May 6, 2011, 12:00 (EDT) (Added). 

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to survey the commercial market for potential Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solutions to improve the current acquisition reporting tools utilized by the Department of Commerce. 

Contracting Office Address:
U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC)
Office of Acquisition Management (OAM)
Commerce Acquisition Systems Division (CASD)
14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Suite 6060
Washington, DC 20230
This is not a solicitation for proposals

Request for Information for a Acquisition Reporting Tool

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY  Solicitations are not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.  All response and response contents to this RFI will be considered information only and will not be binding on the parties.  Contractors responding to this request will not be obligated to provide the services described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that the costs provided as a result of this request are best estimates only.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government.  

The U.S. Department of Commerce is seeking sources, product capability information and pricing information to support a business case and budget for a new acquisition reporting tool/solution.  The focus of this RFI is to take advantage of advancements in technology while benefiting from competitive industry trends.  

In its current state, the acquisition reporting system is cumbersome and time consuming.  Data must be pulled from various disparate systems in order to respond to diverse, mandated reporting requests.  The acquisition data for the Department of Commerce currently resides in the following systems:

Existing DoC Data Stores Used for Reporting Data
#	Name	Description	Owner	Database
1	C.Request	Census Requisition data	DoC/Census	Oracle
2	C.Request	NOAA Requisition data	DoC/NOAA	Oracle
3	C.Request 	NIST Requisition data	DoC/NIST	Oracle
4	C.Request	OS Requisition data	DoC/OS	Oracle
5	C.Buy	Census Contract data	DoC/Census	Oracle
6	C.Buy	NOAA Contract data	DoC/NOAA	Oracle
7	C.Buy	NIST Contract data	DoC/NIST	Oracle
8	C.Buy	OS Contract data	DoC/OS	Oracle
9	FIDO/FAAPS	DoC Acquisition Planning data	GSA	MS SQL Server
10	CFS	Census Financial data	DoC/Census	Oracle
11	CFS	NOAA Financial data	DoC/NOAA	Oracle
12	CFS	NIST Financial data	DoC/NIST	Oracle
13	CFS	OS Financial data	DoC/OS	Oracle
14	Momentum	PTO Acquisition/Financial data	DoC/PTO	Oracle
15	FPDS-NG	DoC Contract Summary data	GSA	Oracle
16	CCR	DoC Vendor data	GSA	Oracle
17	Bank Card	NOAA Bankcard System	DoC/NOAA	Oracle

NOTE:  Some DoC systems allow for cross-service functionality.  Specifically, NOAA, NIST and OS perform acquisition and financial services for other internal DoC bureaus and for each other.  Therefore, a bureaus acquisition or financial data may contain cross-serviced bureau data too.

Many of the systems used by Commerce do not provide a robust data collection and reporting environment which necessitates the need for a more efficient reporting tool/solution.  Further, several systems are separate and provide further challenges regarding consolidating and collection data from all DoC bureaus.  For example, there are four production instances of C.Buy deployed at Commerce one each for:  the Office of the Secretary (OS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Census Bureau.  The DOT Enterprise Services Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma hosts acquisition data for Census, OS, and NOAA.  DOT provides each bureau with their own environment that includes a separate instance of the C.Buy application and Oracle database.  Although also using C.Buy, NIST operates and maintains a separate instance at their Gaithersburg, MD offices.  Collectively, this means that C.Buy is currently located physically at two locations, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Gaithersburg, Maryland.   In addition, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) employs the Momentum finance and procurement system

. 

The majority of DoC utilizes Oracle-based financial systems.  These systems provide commitment, obligation and payment data.  The Commerce Business Solutions (CBS) Center in Gaithersburg, Maryland maintains the departments Core Financial System (CFS).  This system exchanges financial data with the requisition and contract systems.  The PTO employs Momentum as their financial and procurement system.   Momentum is XML based on their application layer and SQL on their database layer (it does support Oracle).  NTIS has a financial system called Budget, Accounting, and Purchasing System (BAPS) and is Government-owned, off-the-shelf software.  

Like all other government agencies, DoC is required to integrate and exchange certain acquisition data with components of the federal Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).   At a minimum, the reporting tool/solution should be able to query and receive data from FedBizOpps, Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Federal Procurement Data System  Next Generation (FPDS-NG).  

While each bureau's data is currently stored in disparate databases, DoC would like to utilize a single reporting tool solution for collecting, consolidating and reporting data.  The overall objective is to expand and improve the quality and timeliness of reporting efficiency at the Department of Commerce for acquisition and financial data with one reporting tool for all data.  The long-term objective is to include other types of business data (i.e., property, human resource, etc.)    

The various systems at DoC continue to evolve.  It is anticipated that in December 2011, DoC will migrate the current acquisition system (C.Buy) with a new acquisition system called C.Award.  This is also an Oracle based contract writing system that is more tightly coupled and highly integrated with the current DoC requisition system (C.Request).  Therefore, our acquisition reporting tool must be easily configurable to meet the ever changing system needs of the department.

Overall Goal
Expand and improve the quality and timeliness of reporting efficiency with one reporting tool


Objectives:

1.Transform from a reactive acquisition reporting environment to a proactive acquisition reporting environment; a transactional environment to an analytical environment
2.Provide quick start-up, ease-of-use, reduce need for intensive & repeated user training
3.Easily configurable to meet changing data systems
4.Achieve reporting interface with (NOAA, OS, Census, NIST, PTO) planning, requisition, contract, IAE, and financial systems
5.Measure and track acquisition results and savings
6.Utilize mature, best of breed products
7.Compliant with all federal legislation and mandates

High Level Functional Requirements
1.Utilize current data warehouse technology and reporting tools.
2.Support Interactive Queries. (Ability to select multiple data elements using an ad hoc tool)
3.Provide interactive analysis. (Allow average users the ability to use ad hoc tools without necessarily understanding the data sets)
4.Provide presentation quality, interactive output of all data. (Both onscreen and printable reports of user created tables and/or graphs)
5.Provide consistent data quality no matter what the view of the data.
6.Provide the ability to transform data into useful information that supports ad-hoc and what-if analysis. 
7.Identify historical trend analysis, and provide the ability to slice-and-dice the information to support DOC business practice requirements. (Ability to select specific data elements across multiple fiscal or calendar years)
8.Meets current security requirements as outlined in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 200, Department of Commerce Information Technology Security standards and with NIST Publications 800-37 and 800-53A
9.Web-based software tool
10.Provides accessibility to data utilizing one system from the users desktop
11.Provide potential accessibility to all members of the acquisition community and customers
12.Provides drill-down capability from summary data to detailed data (Ability to go from the Department-level to the transactional or line item level)

Pricing Information Request:

INSTRUCTIONS:  Please provide pricing information (in thousands of dollars) for each activity by fiscal year.  Pricing data should be provided over the 5 year lifecycle and the out-years should reflect inflation factors as determined by your pricing model.  

Budget planning is for the system implementation to begin in FY 2011 and be complete by FY 2011.  While costs in FY 2011 may include both non-recurring and recurring costs, it is anticipated that FY 2012 and beyond will be only steady state recurring operation and maintenance costs.  

For budget planning we distinguish between non-recurring costs to deploy the system (Implementation Activities) and recurring year-to year costs which represent Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Activities.  You will see some elements such as training in both acquisition and in operations and maintenance.  In this case, training in the acquisition phase is to train the initial workforce on new software, while in the operations and maintenance phase, the concentration is training of new features and hires.  It is important to keep the concept of segregating recurring from non-recurring costs.

Some O&M activities are not performed annually, such as certification and accreditation (a as tri-annual federal requirement) or hardware refresh on a three to five year cycle (depending on your own estimate).  While these are not annual activities, they are considered recurring costs to be reflected in the O&M section because they are not associated directly with deploying the system as opposed to maintaining the system.

Specific pricing information for activities will be considered a rough order of magnitude and should be based on experience with other similar projects and understanding.  It would be most helpful to include estimates along with quality remarks that you would deem to be beneficial in understanding your estimates.  These should be provided in a narrative separate from the spreadsheet in a separate MS Word or Adobe Acrobat document.

Following are the descriptions for the price elements to be completed in the spreadsheet.

<DESC>The vendors should be aware the RESNA Test Report is a stand-alone document which reports the results of the specified sections and clauses described on pgs. 85-87 of the original solicitation.  The VA is aware that in some, but not all cases results contained within the RESNA report will directly confirm whether the Standard Functions and Features or Required Options are available.   There is no expectation that the Vendor add additional information to the RESNA test report beyond what was originally requested on pgs. 85-87 of the original solicitation. Confirmation of all Standard Functions and Features as well as Required Options is possible in other ways, such as through the technical evaluation.   

The RESNA sections and clauses required (pgs. 85-87 of the original solicitation) will provide additional information about the performance of the device which is not listed in the specification column of the 'Minimum Performance Criteria' Table on pp 9.   For example, as indicated on PP 9 of the solicitation, required measurements of device weight, length, width and turning radius are not indicated. However results from required RESNA tests will be reviewed as part of the technical evaluation (e.g. a smaller turning radius will be determined to be more maneuverable than a larger turning radius).

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	(  )    (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	( )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )    (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )    (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )    (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )    (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )    (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   41 USC 253(c), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2 states when an agency's need for supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured the agency may limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids and proposals.   The surgeons at the Salisbury VAMC have been borrowing Stryker Drill Sets from the manufacturer for use in the OR.  The surgeons use the drills to create holes in bone for surgical screws, and to install and remove said screws.  The manufacturer has begun to conduct trials in other facilities and will pick up the loaned instruments on May 12, 2011.  These instruments have been used by every surgeon each day she/he operates.  The vendor can provide a set for the Salisbury VAMC to be delivered by May 20, 2011, which will prevent cancellation of surgeries at the medical center.  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Prior to obtaining the loaner set from Stryker, two other drill sets were tested by the surgeons.  The Stryker set provided the best results for the Veterans undergoing surgery.  Stryker is the only source for their surgical drills and parts, resulting in an inability to solicit from resellers.  

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Stryker offers discounted VA pricing, reflected in the estimated cost.  When comparing prices to those on schedule, it appears the estimated cost of this procurement would result in similar pricing if similar items were bought using FSS schedules.  However, it is difficult to do an exact comparison with schedule pricing as the drills and bits being procured are smaller than those on schedule.  Prior to borrowing the equipment, patients requiring the procedures allowed by this system were sent for surgery on a fee-basis.  Since borrowing the equipment more than 12 patients have been able to have the procedure at the Salisbury VAMC, providing a significant cost savings to the medical center.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research was conducted though examination of products offered at GSA Advantage.  The hospital conducted market research through comparison of products from three vendors.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The contract specialist has offered to work with the customer from the beginning of the acquisition process, vice starting involvement after evaluation, structuring solicitations around the evaluation of different products to allow for a seamless purchase once a decision has been made by the customer and funding has been approved.
