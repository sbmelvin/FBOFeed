<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Apollo Telemedicine Inc. of Falls Church VA to upgrade the existing Apollo Telepathology equipment located at various sites throughout VISN12.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302 - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NAICS 339112. The proposed imaging upgrade will include the Apollo ASAP Imaging video streaming device and software, Apollo Telepathology Microscope Camera package, and C-mount lens coupler for the existing microscopes at the transmitting workstations. The purpose of the upgrade is to improve the full motion image quality from the transmitting VA telepathology workstation to the consulting VA workstation and increase the full motion image resolution from the existing 355 x 244 x 16 bits to 704 x 480 x 32 bits. The Apollo ASAP Imaging upgrade will enable remote access with live streaming images from a microscope to authorized and qualified PC's on a  TCP/IP network.  Compatibility with existing equipment is required. Based upon the above, to the best of our knowledge, Apollo Telemedicine Inc. is the only vendor who has the capability of meeting these requirements.

However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer by the response date indicated. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Government to award a sole source contract modification to Radian, Inc.  It is a development effort (Spiral 3a) to expand the capability of the United States Air Force Smart Gate, an integrated system using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and modified COTS products that automate the vehicle and driver identification process. Radian, Inc. has developed the Smart Gate prototype, Spiral 1.  Spiral 1 identified the best technology to verify authorized installation entry. Spiral 2 refined that technology.  Spiral 3 improved the bar code reader technology, implemented a Central Gatekeeper (CGK) to provide automated personnel databases and visitor access control capabilities, upgraded the Local Gatekeeper (LGK) database and software.  Spiral 3a  will further refine Spiral 3 efforts by:  1.  Providing the functional capability for integrating the new Spiral 3 LGK application into the existing GSA FY03 Smart Gate Core/Visitor Center Enrollment System (VCES) (Smart Gate Phase 1) equipment and software design, including Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for multiple vendors' access control systems/computers; 2.  Creating an interface with the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) that will transfer personnel data via network and removable media (e.g., 3-1/2" disk, CD, flash memory, etc.) to both the already existing CGK and LGK and 3.  Creating an interface with SFMIS that will transfer visitor entry history from the CGK and the LGK to SFMIS for historical archiving purposes.  The proposed contract action is for development or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Information received within 15 calendar days of publication will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>C-Architect-Engineer Services Solicitation # GS-04P-04-EXC-0039 – Charlotte, North Carolina, Contracting Officer's Phone Number(404) 331-4630 Continuing a centuries-old legacy of extraordinary public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects to design Federal buildings of outstanding quality and value, buildings that provide superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees as well as give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a New United States Courthouse to be constructed in Charlotte, North Carolina in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The building is approximately 34,069 gross square meters (gsm) 366,724 gross square feet (gsf) without parking, and approximately 36,298 gsm 390,724 gsf including 60 interior parking spaces.  The proposed courthouse will provide a total of twelve (12) courtrooms - six (6) district - three (3) magistrate -three (3) bankruptcy courtrooms.  The building will house the District, Magistrate and Bankruptcy Courts: U. S. Attorney: U. S. Marshals Service: U. S. Probation: U. S. Pretrial Service: Public Defenders and GSA.  The proposed facility will be constructed in Central Business District of Charlotte, NC with the site identified, but not formally acquired as being the city block of approximately 3.27 acres bounded by East Trade Street, North Caldwell Street, East Fifth Street, and North Davidson Street.

<SUBJECT>A -- Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository
<SOLNBR>NIMH-04-DB-0001
<RESPDATE>030204
<CONTACT>Bruce Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2234, Fax 301-443-0501, Email ba9i@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health is soliciting proposals from qualified businesses/organizations to establish, maintain/operate, and replenish the Small Molecule Repository.  The Small Molecule Repository will be a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap Molecular Libraries initiative for the creation of an NIH small molecule library and screening centers (for additional information on the NIH Roadmap, see http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/).  The Small Molecule Repository will offer public sector biomedical researchers access to small organic molecules that can be used as chemical probes to study cellular pathways in greater depth and will provide new ways to explore the functions of major components of the cell in health and disease.  In order to provide these benefits, the library of small molecules must contain a sufficient number of diverse compounds to be screened for a large number of possible new activities and applications. To build such a library, a contract will be established to acquire, maintain, and distribute a collection of approximately 1,000,000 chemically diverse small molecules of both known and unknown activities. An NIH Molecular Libraries Coordinating Committee and an external scientific advisory group will help identify candidate compounds to be acquired from government, academic, industry and commercial sources. Over time, this collection will be expanded and modified to include compounds that are capable of interacting with an increasing number and diversity of biomolecular target domains. The development of such libraries will provide probes for studying molecular events, pathways, and networks in biologic systems that span the scale from single cells to whole organisms.

Requirements for the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository include the following tasks:

1) Compound Identification and Library Development.  The contractor, in coordination with the NIH Molecular Libraries Coordinating Committee and an external scientific advisory group, shall identify candidate compounds from government, academic, industry and commercial sources, and acquire a collection of approximately 1,000,000 compounds meeting criteria to be specified by the Government Project Officer (GPO)/Coordinating Committee (i.e., stability, solubility, availability of sufficient quantities, ease of re-supply or re-synthesis, diversity). 

2) Handling, Plating and Distribution.  All compounds shall be bar-coded and arrayed in sets suitable for supplying to high-throughput screening (HTS) facilities.  The contractor shall have the capability to array compounds into both 96 and 384 well plates to produce arrays in formats suitable for long term storage and distribution.  The contractor shall also have the ability to produce arrays in other formats suitable for distribution (i.e. daughter-plates developed from plate replication or reformatting into higher density 1536 or 3456 well plates).  Compound arrays shall be distributed to the Molecular Library Screening Centers and other interested HTS facilities.  The contractor shall also provide arrays of compounds to investigators on a fee for service basis.

3) Storage.  The contractor shall provide dry storage of compounds as well as storage of compounds in solution.  Compounds shall be stored under conditions that ensure optimal stability and purity. The contractor shall provide the necessary expertise, equipment, and facilities to store, maintain, and track the compound collection inventory.  The contractor shall monitor the stability of compounds in the library (e.g., analysis by LC/MS, HPLC, and/or NMR).

4) Re-supply and Re-synthesis.  The contractor shall monitor the compound inventory to ensure that sufficient quantities of all compounds (typically between 5 and 30mg) are available to support screening needs.  As compounds become depleted the Contractor shall purchase sufficient quantities of the compound to replenish the inventory.  The Contractor shall have the ability to synthesize, at a minimum purity of 90%, sufficient quantities of depleted compounds that cannot be re-purchased.

5) Informatics.  The Contractor shall provide the necessary informatics support to track compound inventory and distribution, including maintenance of a compound collection inventory database and a shipping and distribution database.  The contractor shall create and maintain a repository website, describing the program and providing a list of available compound arrays.  The contractor shall also have the capability of interfacing any repository informatics systems with other Molecular Libraries databases and informatics systems.  

6) Confidentiality. The contractor may be acquiring and handling some proprietary compounds under this contract.  In order to acquire such compounds, the suppliers may require their rights to inventions using these materials be fully protected. Therefore, the NIMH may request, as specified in FAR 27.303, a deviation for this contract from the standard patent rights clause, FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights - Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (June 1997), which if approved would restrict the Contractor's rights in subject inventions involving such proprietary compounds.  Public comments shall be solicited in the Federal Business Opportunities (as a Special Notice) and also in the solicitation for this contract, before a deviation is requested.

The NIMH anticipates the award of one (1) contract for a base period of approximately 52 months, plus five (5) one-year options. RFP No. NIMH-04-DB-0001 will be available electronically on or about December 29, 2003. You can access the RFP through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov), through the NIH Roadmap Grants and Funding Opportunities website (URL: http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/grants/index.asp), or through the NIMH website (URL: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/grants/indexcon.cfm#RequestforProposal). Please note that NIMH uses the streamlined RFP format that includes only the statement of work, deliverables, reporting requirements, any special requirements, mandatory qualifications (if any), technical evaluation criteria, and other necessary proposal preparation instructions. All information required for the submission of a proposal is contained in or accessible through the streamlined RFP package. Response to the RFP will be due on or about March 2, 2004. NIMH will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror. This advertisement does not commit the government to award a contract.

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to Hydro mulch an area that was burned over during the Willow Fire.  The project is located on the Tonto National Forest adjacent to Hwy 87 (Township 7N, Range 9E, Section 16).  Due to the danger of rolling rocks from the burned area above the road cuts along the highway 87, hydro mulch will be applied to about 20 acres of the slopes above the highway.  Access will be from a turnout to the right on the southbound lane of the highway near milepost 225.  

Hydro mulch will be applied to the uphill and downhill side of a narrow, half mile long road that runs along the top of the road cuts (the old highway alignment).  Slopes are approximately 25% with some brush and no standing timber.  The access road and area to hydro mulched does not allow normal size equipment to turn around on the road.  There for hydro mulch may need to be applied by ATV or similar equipment. 

Rate of application per acre is 1,500 lbs of wood fiber mulch plus 80 lbs of tackifier.
Contractor shall provide all equipment, labor, materials including water, and traffic control along Highway 87. Coordination with Arizona DOT will be necessary for traffic control during the performance of work.

<DESC>The Southern Region of the USDA Forest Service is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements with vendors capable of providing recreation management consulting services.    The Recreation, Wilderness, and Heritage Staff of the Southern Region of the USDA Forest Service is responsible for recreation, wilderness, and heritage resource management on National Forest lands in fourteen Southeastern States and Puerto Rico. In a continuing effort to meet the public’s demands and expectations for recreation opportunities and to maximize the value of available funds, a need has been identified for professional consulting services to assist with the development and implementation of a more business-based approach to recreation management.  In addition to supporting efforts in the Southeast, the professional consulting services may also be used to address issues of national scope.  The need for these consulting services will be intermittent over time, and the quantity is indefinite.

The type of projects may include strategic financial planning and program management, financial analysis, recreation market analysis, operational efficiency evaluations, analysis of recreation concessions and special use permits, facility management assessment, marketing, and data management and security assessment.     The majority of these services require individuals with broad technical and professional knowledge combined with specific knowledge of USDA Forest Service recreation policies and programs.     Businesses holding GSA MOBIS schedule contracts (SIN 874-1) that are interested in being considered for award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement for the services described above should review the documents that will be posted on this site around August 20, 2004.  Please make inquiries by e-mail only.  This procurement is open to schedule vendors of any business size.

<SUBJECT>S -- Presolicitation Notice for Privatization of Natural Gas Distribution System at Red River Army Depot, TX
<SOLNBR>SP0600-04-R-0132
<CONTACT>Christine Bond-Jawish, Facility Energy Specialist, Phone 7037673298, Fax 7037672382, Email christine.bondjawish@dla.mil
<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the natural gas distribution system at Red River Army Depot, Texas.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Offerors will not be required to submit offers on all of the utility systems and may submit offers on individual system(s) or on groups of systems on an all or none basis.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately. 
The Utility System being privatized is described as follows:
Installation: Red River Army Depot
Location: Red River Army Depot, Texas is located in Central Bowie County, near Texarkana, Texas.
Installation Description:  Red River Army Depot (RRAD, Red River or the Installation) is an U.S. Army Installation located in Central Bowie County, near Texarkana, Texas. Established in 1941, the Installation was initially designated Red River Ordnance Depot. The Installation was combined with the adjacent Lone Star Ordnance Plant in 1943 and the two installations were called the Texarkana Ordnance Center. In 1945 the two installations were designated Red River Arsenal and then once again became Red River Ordnance Depot (1961). The two installations were separated again in 1962 and this installation became Red River Army Depot.  RRAD consists of 19,081 acres, 3 million square feet of covered storage, and 2.9 million square feet of outdoor storage. Its primary responsibility is the rebuild/reconfiguration of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle System including storage, maintenance and demilitarization of ammunition and missiles. Today RRAD operates as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Installation. A portion of the Installation was determined to be in excess of the Army’s requirement and as such, a portion of RRAD was BRAC’d or transferred to the local Re-use Authority. Today, the BRAC’d area is active and operated by the Red River Re-Use Authority (RRRA).

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

A. Natural Gas Distribution System Description
The RRAD natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation, and/or Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation as defined by the real estate instruments. Generally, the point of demarcation will be the building footprint. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree, the description following in subsequent paragraphs. Under no circumstances shall the Offeror be entitled to any rate adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
The Installation’s existing natural gas distribution system includes approximately 97,638 linear feet of medium and high-density polyethylene, steel, and coated and wrapped steel pipe, 34 main valves, 83 industrial services and 27 residential services. The distribution mains range in size from less than 2 inches to 6 inches in diameter. There are high and low pressure lines that make up the distribution system. Low pressure is approximately 20-25 psi and the high pressure is approximately 50-60 psi. The entire distribution system at RRAD is owned, operated and maintained by the Government. This includes the section of the distribution system located within the BRAC area.
According to Installation personnel and as observed from the inventory, approximately 71 percent of the RRAD natural gas distribution system has been replaced or upgraded to polyethylene pipe since 1970. However, some of the original pipeline (installed in 1943) is still in service. The remaining steel and coated and wrapped steel pipe receives no cathodic protection or checks annually. Overall, the system is considered to be in good to excellent condition as rated by the Installation personnel.
Several conditions exist that may effect the ownership and operation of RRAD’s natural gas utility system. Some of these conditions include: radio frequency use limitations, special security concerns, non-government operations and tenants and utilities located inside blast perimeters.
The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the Natural Gas Distribution System.



The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Christine Bond Jawish at 703-767-3298 to be added to our bidder mailing list.  
A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL.  The solicitation will be available on or after September 8, 2004.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Neha Dhir, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 496-6546, Fax (301) 402-0642, Email dhirn@mail.nlm.nih.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with the Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum (APIAHF), San Francisco, CA, to further develop the Asian American Health Website.  The period of performance is one (1) year with one one-year option period. 

In 2003, NLM launched the Asian American Health Website (http://asianamericanhealth.nlm.nih.gov/) in order to increase knowledge about Asian Americans and their health status by providing current, accurate and culturally-appropriate health research and clinical information for and about Asian Americans.   The information on the website is targeted to health consumers, providers and researchers.

NLM plans to collaborate with APIAHF to further develop, expand the content and promote the use of the website.  Specifically, APIAHF shall:

1.	Establish a users board composed of professionals in research, data collection, health care, public health, and member of community-based organizations, schools, institutions that will work with APIAHF to act as an advisory body to provide guidance on the development of NLM’s Asian American Health Website and to develop and promote the website.

2.	Analyze, assess and provide recommendations for the expansion and enhancement of NLM’s Asian American Health Website with regard to content and usability.

3.	Develop protocols and an implementation plan for the improvement and maintenance of the NLM Asian American Health Website.

APIAHF is uniquely qualified to provide these services.  APIAHF is a national organization dedicated to promoting policy, program and research efforts for the improvement of health status of all Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.  The mission of the APIAHF works closely with other Asian American and Pacific Islander organizations and the Asian American community in general.  This is a unique organization for NLM to work with in this health information development and dissemination project because they are the only organization devoted to broadly working on health promotion and improvement of the Asian American community at both the national and community level.  They are unique in having the technical expertise to work with electronic health information resources and also the community involvement necessary to this project.  APIAHF has the knowledge to identify the appropriate organizations and communities with which to work as well as the credibility needed to negotiate for the use of the NLM we site of health information resources not currently in digital format.  In addition, the promotion of the use of this web site within the Asian American community is a critical part of this project and APIAHF is well situated to accomplish that task. 

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria:

1.  Past Performance:  The contractor shall provide past performance information that demonstrate knowledge and experience in the following: experience working with other Asian American Health organizations, including those representing health professionals as well as consumers; experience working with Asian American community-based organizations throughout the United States; experience in dealing with Asian Americans and their health issues; ability to create a users group representing the stakeholders appropriate to the NLM Asian American Health web site; demonstration of a create understanding of the target population and their need for health information.

6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Short-term (one month)
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	Background

The Regional USAID Mission for the Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR), located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, is responsible for the development and management of the USG regional assistance program directed at improving livelihoods through support to economic, democratic, social sector, and natural resources reform and development in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

The Program Support Office provides traditional programmatic support to the USAID/CAR Mission.  The office’s principal functions include:  a) management of the program budget; b) monitoring/evaluation of program performance and analyses of program strategic relevance and direction; c) oversight of the program approval process; d) oversight and final preparation of Mission reporting requirements, principally the annual report; e) preparation and dissemination of public information material; and f) management of the Participant Training Program and the Eurasia Foundation grant.

The FY 04 program budget is approximately $109 million, with a carryover FY 03 budget of approximately $25 million.  The USAID/Central Asia Republic Mission is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Dushanbe, Tajikistan and Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.  The technical programs in the Mission focus on energy/water, health, enterprise development, democracy/conflict mitigation, and education.

There is strong Washington interest in the program, including close scrutiny by Congress as well as by the State Department.  Funding for the program is authorized through the Freedom Support Act.  The State Department is responsible for implementation of the Act, and USAID programming is done in very close coordination with the embassies in each of the countries and the State Department’s Coordinator’s office in Washington, D.C., which has oversight responsibility for implementation of the Freedom Support Act.

The Program Support Office is responsible for management and/or oversight of Strategic Objective 4.2 (the cross-cutting SO), which includes one contract (Participant Training), two cooperative agreements (the Arizona-Kazakhstan Partnership and Eurasia Foundation), carryover budgeting for basic education and conflict prevention, and funding for program development and support.

B) Major Duties and Responsibilities

The contractor will provide short-term expertise to the Program Support Office from on/about September 27 through on/about October 22.  The contractor will report to the Project Development Officer, Acting Program Support Office Director; and, manage the Program Support Office from October 4-8 during the Project Development Officer’s absence.  During the Project Development Officer’s absence, the contractor will report to the Deputy Mission Director, and be responsible for all aspects of programming oversight, including the program budget, cross-cutting activities, activity approval, policy-related questions, preparation of information products, and an office of five personnel.  

The contractor’s other responsibilities, to be performed during the contractual period include:

1.	Assisting with programmatic and budget support services to Mission technical offices and country offices, particularly as this pertains to the FY 04 and FY 05 budgets.

2.	Providing necessary follow-up to intensive reviews for Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, scheduled at the end of September.  

3.	Managing the Mission’s preparation for a semi-annual review, to be scheduled in October or November.  

4.	Assisting with planning for and preparation of the Mission’s FY 04 Annual Report, including drafting a summary of Annual Report guidance for SO teams and organizing and delivering, in cooperation with the Project Development Officer and the FSN Project Management Specialist, a session with SO teams to explain changes in the Annual Report application and guidance.  

5.	Consulting donor and host country strategies for the Central Asia region and developing a summary of non-USG programming.  Review with the Project Development Officer strategic focus and direction of the USAID/CAR strategy and programs and provide recommendations for the Mission’s future strategy development.

6.	Assisting with the finalization of concept papers for the E&E Bureau’s GDA Incentive
Fund.

7.	Other duties as assigned.

C) Supervision and Relationships

The contractor will be supervised by the Project Development Officer, and by the Deputy Mission Director during the Project Development Officer’s absence.  The contractor will supervise the following program support office staff during the Project Development Officer’s absence:
1 US Resident PSC Information Specialist – GS-12
	1 FSN Program Budget Specialist – FSN-11
	1 FSN Project Management Specialist – FSN-12
1 FSN Project Management Specialist – FSN-10	
1 FSN Administrative Assistant – FSN-7

Although direct supervision of the Participant Training Program and the two cooperative agreements rests with the FSN-12 Project Management Specialist, the contractor will provide appropriate technical direction and leadership during the Project Development Officer’s absence.

D) Other Factors

A high degree of tact, firmness, and creativity is required at all times.  Interpersonal skills are also at a premium, given the large number of people both within and outside the U.S. Mission with which the Program Support Office must engage.  Mission technical offices operate with a high degree of autonomy and program support functions must be adaptive to a value-added approach.

E) Required Qualifications

Five or more years as a program/project development officer with international development organization is required.  Supervisory management experience is preferred.  Specific experience in working with program budget management is required.  Excellent analytical and team building skills are essential.  References are required.

<DESC>The primary point-of-contact for this procurement is now Dannie Jennings, Contracting Officer, 317-554-1765, fax: 317-554-0200, e-mail: dannie.jennings2@med.va.gov. This announcement provides a notice of intent to procure a bundled contract.  Any interested party may submit written comments to the Indianapolis VA Medical Center (VAMC), during a 15-day public comment period that ends on September 4, 2004.  The Indianapolis VAMC is seeking sources to provide Durable Medical Equipment (DME) services for the VAMCs located in Indiana (Indianapolis, Marion, and Ft. Wayne), plus Danville, Illinois.  All individual requirements for DME services would be generated by one of these VAMCs.  NAICS code 621610 and a small business size standard of $11.5 million applies.  DME services cover the delivery of government-owned DME to veteran’s residences in any county located within Indiana, Illinois, or western Ohio.  Service Area One covers the Indianapolis VAMC.  Both the Marion and Ft. Wayne campuses of the VA Northern Indiana Health Care System are combined under Service Area Two.  Service Area Three covers the VA Illiana Health Care System at Danville, IL.  Each service area will include various delivery zones involving multiple counties.  The Government may make multiple awards.  DME services include delivery, installation, pick-up, contractor-owned or leased storage facility, cleaning, repair, and maintenance.  This acquisition does NOT involve the purchase of any DME items from vendors.   These VAMCs must meet or exceed Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards.  All hospital-based home care programs must meet or exceed JCAHO Home Care Standards.  All contractors must provide all DME services in accordance with the standards established by the JCAHO.  Contractors do NOT have to be JCAHO accredited, but they must simply follow, and meet or exceed the JCAHO standards.  All subcontractors will be subject to the same requirements as the prime contractor.   The solicitation will be posted to the VA Business Opportunities System (BOS) website on or about October 8, 2004, and proposals will be due approximately 30 days thereafter.  Small business concerns are encouraged to submit a written expression of their interest in this procurement.  The solicitation will be issued as a 100% small business set-aside in accordance with FAR 19.502-2, Total Small Business Set-Asides, if there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns, and that award will be made at fair market prices.  Otherwise, the solicitation may be issued as a Cascade Small Business Set-Aside, where ALL OFFERORS, regardless of business size, will be encouraged to submit an offer.  If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from responsible small business concerns, under the Cascade set-aside procedure the set-aside will be withdrawn, and award will be made on the basis of full and open competition from among ALL responsible business (small and large business) concerns that submit an offer.  All interested parties are encouraged to register for notifications by entering the Solicitation Mailing List Application on the VA BOS website under Solicitation No.: 583-05-05.

<DESC>MT PFH 73-1(5), PIONEER MOUNTAINS SCENIC BYWAY, Beaverhead National Forest, Beaverhead county, Montana.  This modification is issued to: (1) Change response date to 12/1/2004; (2) Correct project name to:  Pioneer Mountains Scenic BYWAY; (3) Provide a Second Notice to Prospective Bidders as follows: August 2004, SECOND NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS: Project:  MT PFH 73-1(5), Pioneer Mountains Scenic Byway, Solicitation No.  DTFH70-04-B-00003.  THIS NOTICE IS TO ADVISE you of the possible delay of the issuance of this solicitation until the winter of 2004/2005 when viewing of the project will not be possible due to snow cover.  Prospective bidders are encouraged to view the project prior to winter snowfall.  A gate will be closed and locked on December 1st thus preventing the viewing of the upper portion of the project.  It is possible that snowfall would necessitate an earlier closing.  Preliminary plans were made available on October 16, 2003 to aid prospective bidders in identifying the location and type of work.  Unfortunately, the expected solicitation has been unavoidably delayed due to environmental consultation.  Consultation is now complete and the affected changes are being made to the solicitation.  These 2003 preliminary plans still convey the overall intent of the project and will assist you when you view the project site. While it is not required, we highly recommend that you videotape the entire project for your use during the estimating phase.  We have had good feedback from contractors who have done this in the past.  No Federal Highway Administration personnel will be available for show-me tours. This project is located approximately 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Dillon, Montana, in Beaverhead County.  The project begins at the intersection of Maverick Mountain Ski Area and Pioneer Mountains Scenic Byway (otherwise known as Wise River-Polaris Road) and ends at the summit near Price Creek.  No signs have been erected to identify the project extents.  The project consists of grading, drainage, base, paving roadway and turnouts, and construction of two bridges.  It was designed using metric measurement and references the Standard Specifications for Roads and Bridges on Federal Highway Projects, FP-96.  For general questions on this contract, please contact our office at contracts@mail.wfl.fhwa.dot.gov or at 360.619.7520 and PRESS 0.  For information about plans and specifications submit written questions only via fax to 360.619.7932, e mail at:  plans_spec@fhwa.dot.gov, or mail to the Contracts Section at the above address.  Solicitation documents will be available on the FedBizOpps website during the winter of 2004/2005.  Please monitor FedBizOpps or our Western Federal Lands highway website at http://www.wfl.fhwa.dot.gov/edi for actual date of solicitation release.  To receive automatic notification through FedBizOpps, go to that site and select the “register to receive notification” feature and follow the steps.  Thank you for your continued interest in this project.

SOURCES SOUGHT/INDUSTRY DAYS FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS  III) ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought/Industry Days Parts and  Repair Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However, the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

INTRODUCTION: Our goal is to develop an acquisition strategy that allows us  to achieve outstanding performance while significantly reducing our cost of  doing business with a manageable level of risk.  While we welcome your input  throughout the acquisition process, your suggestions and comments will be  especially valuable as we develop our acquisition strategy.   2.  BACKGROUND:  Program Title The Parts and Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) is a service contract managed  by the Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC). It is available to satisfy  logistics requirements for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  PROS II  provides a capability to purchase a wide range of nonstandard and difficult to  support standard parts and maintenance services.  PROS II also provides a  vehicle for contracting for specialized engineering and technical services  through task orders. Contract Effort Description The PROS II Program functions much the same as an Air Logistics Center.  The  contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance  services and the management of task orders.  The contract is managed by a  dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s performance  and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS II are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However, the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. Note: See chart one for how the PROS II program process works.  SAMIS stands  for Security Assistance Management Information System. Developmental Phase PROS III the Follow-on to PROS II  We are entering the developmental phase of the follow-on to PROS II.   Chart Two Explanation Chart shows PR (purchase request) being offered up to contractors A and B (1)  for competitive supply/maintenance fill action.  Contractors A and B in competition with each other go to their OEM partners or  competitive vendors (2) for quotes. Price and Lead Time (LT) are provided to the USAF by contractors A and B (3)  and the USAF then selects the best offer (4). The contractor (A or B) with the best offer receives the order (5) and they  issue a contract (6) with the appropriate vendor. Shipment is made as quoted (7) and services charges are paid (8). Winner takes all.  The loosing contractor receives no recompense for their  efforts unless they win an award to fill an order. Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Possible options include, but would not be limited to, multiple award and other  Governmental agencies receiving orders with respect to contractor B. Goal Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.  We are  soliciting comments from industry on the attached approach (chart two) with  regard to feasibility, suggested incentives and interest in PROS III  participation. 3.

<DESC>This synopsis/solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on-Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO in unavailable.

This constitutes Amendment 0002 to N000178-04-R-2031 issued for the purchase of Office Automation Services. This amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted in response to the RFP issued 29 July 2004 and Amendment 0001 issued 16 August 2004: (1) QUESTION:  What is the acceptable cost range NAVSEA is expecting for the solution? Does this range include professional services?  (1) ANSWER:  The Governments cost estimate is non-disclosable. All proposals will be evaluated using the fa! ctors listed in the combined synopsis/solicitation, which includes price and non-price factors. The products and services to be delivered under the contract are listed in the combined synopsis/solicitation and include professional services. Proposals must include the total cost for the offeror to provide all items under the contract.  (2) QUESTION:  If offerors proposed a project delivery team with the capabilities to work with NAVSEA to develop refined business processes and update the functionality of the system accordingly, to develop integration points with other technology systems at NAVSEA, provide strategic planning and project oversight, etc., is this in the scope of this project?  Or, is NAVSEA only looking for system administration services to support the technology system itself?  (2) ANSWER:  The answer to the first question is No. The answer to the second question is Yes.  (3) QUESTION:  Has NAVSEA already documented the information that would be needed to stand up a solution in 14 days?  Namely, user groups and hierarchies, business rules, authentication and log-in requirements, data for pull down menus in the system, keyword groups and lists, and all other information referred to directly in the solicitation notice?  (3) ANSWER:  The Government seeks to use an existing solution and modify as necessary to fine tune it.  (4) QUESTION:  What is the business driver behind standing up a solution in 14 days? Is this meant as a pilot or as a production release?  (4) ANSWER:  Answer to first question is: The need for a quick, existing solution. Answer to the second question is: Production. (5) QUESTION:  Please confirm that NAVSEA is looking for a hosted solution on an application service provider model and that NAVSEA would not host the system at their facility.  (5) ANSWER: Correct.  (6) QUESTION:  How big of a pipe do you require to your chosen vendor? Do you want it dedicated? (6) ANSWER:  We do not require a dedicated pipe. It should be Web-Based.  (7) QUESTION:  What are your current document counts that you will put into the system, and what volume do you think you will have going forward…This is so we can determine the storage capacities needed for the proposed system.  (7) ANSWER: We have no current document count. It will continue to grow as time goes by. Initially, they should plan on at least 80 GB. (8) QUESTION: With regard to selective CD Burning. How often will this take place, and since you have access to the system, is this something that your personnel will take care of or something that you want to winning vendor to handle. If the later, we need to know how often and in what volume. (8) ANSWER:  The vendor would be taking care of the CD burning. It is up to the vendor to provide a proposed plan to accomplish this. At the very least, at least once a week.  (9) QUESTION: We are DOD 5015.2 Certified (Chapter 2 and 4)  - is this a requirement for this system?  (9) ANSWER: No.  (10) QUESTION: How many scanning stations will there be? If we have to provide the hardware, we will need to know how many scan stations, and their locations. (10) ANSWER:  No scanning stations. All input will be electronic.  (11) QUESTION: Do you use Active Directory to give folks access to certain systems?  (11) ANSWER:  No.   (12) QUESTION: Are you going to create your own WorkFlows, or do you want the winning vendor to do that?  (12) ANSWER: The work flows will be defined by us as far as notification and routing.  (13) QUESTION:  Do you want your firm fixed price to include the cost of maintenance to the system, or is that a separate item?  (13) ANSWER: The general maintenance of the hardware should be included in the price.  (14) QUESTION: Since you have a current mail server, for the inclusion of email being part of the proposed system, would it be sufficient to say that we would tap your current email server, and archive and index all emails and their attachments into the Document Management System?  (14) ANSWER: The system should include a simple stand alone mail program in the case the existing e-mail is not available.  (15) QUESTION: What legacy systems do you have that will be part of the data entry? We would propose to integrate to those systems (if you want) so that data entry is done o! nce. Data entry into your legacy system while viewing the document can link the Data and the document together so that retrieval can be done through your legacy application or within the document management system. If you have current systems in place that folks are keying data to, we can integrate to them as well so as to provide those users the ability to see, review, edit, etc... documents/records that have been scanned into the system. They would have a show me the paper button that would automatically log them into the Doc management system and allow them to retrieve the supporting documents associated with that data.  (15) ANSWER:  No.   (16) QUESTION: Do you have a budget for this project, and if yes, what is it?  (16) ANSWER: See answer (1).   (17) QUESTION:  You state in section 2.4 that notification of work is to be done through email. You further state that the system needs to be able to send mail out directly. If your email system is out, how do you propose that the end user gets their work-to-do? I propose that if that happens, the user can log into our system, and they would be given what their work is, allowing them to work and know what they have to do regardless of your internal email servers) being down.  (18) ANSWER:  We are not so concerned with doing work. We are more concerned about notification of a document that has been uploaded. The last part of the question is a proposal to solve the issue. Such information is to be included in the offerors formal proposal.

<SUBJECT>B--TO EVALUATE CUMMULATIVE CONCENTRATIONS OF PESTICIDES USED IN MOSQUITO ABATEMENT.
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is planning on making award to San Jose Ste University Foundation and partnering iwth the CA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife along with the University of California, Davis.  The goal of this project is to evaluate whether repeated applications of mosquito adulticides have cumulative effects on water quality and invertebrate communities in wetlands.  Three wetland cells adjacent to the most frequently utilized adulticide application on the Colusa National Wildlife Refuge will be used to monitor invertebrate response to repeated mosquito control applications. These will be the same units where water and sediment samples are taken. Three similar wetland cells on Delevan National Wildlife Refuge, where no mosquito abatement activity occurs, will be matched to treated sites as closely as possible in terms of vegetation, flooding date, and depth.  Initial water and sediment samples will assess whether source water is contaminated at the sites.  The San Jose Foundation was part of the original project with the above mentioned programs and they are able to provide samples that no other entity has.  This is not a notice for competitive process but vendors are able to reply to this announcement within 7 days from the date of this notice.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-04-R-SK03, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-24 and DFARS Change Notice 20040810.  The associated NAICS code is 334419 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  NRL has a requirement for Contract Line Item(s) CLIN(s) as follows:  CLIN 0001 - The Contractor shall provide a Flip Chip Bonder, quantity: 1 each in accordance with the following specification.  The Bonder must support adhesive, eutectic, preform, solder, thermocompression, and thermosonic bonding.  Flexibility to handle a wide variety of bonding techniques and devices is important; speed of operation is unimportant.  The flip chip bonder should also be able to perform conventional die attach with controlled dispensing of epoxy or solder paste.  The equipment’s end use is in a laboratory research environment.  The system shall meet the following specifications:  Placement accuracy must be 1 micron or better.  Minimum die size must be 200 microns x 200 microns or smaller.  Maximum die size must be at least 2 inches x 2 inches with heating capability (temperature specified below).  Maximum substrate size must be at least 100 mm x 100 mm.  Strong preference will be given to a system able to heat and bond a 100 mm x 10 mm die and a similarly-sized substrate.  Both substrate and die holders must be capable of temperature control to 400 C for thermocompression bonding.  Applied force must be controllable, with a minimum force of 30 grams or less and a maximum force of 9 kg or more, with an upgrade path to at least 50 kg.  It is not necessary to cover the entire force range without hardware changes.  The range may be adequately covered in multiple ranges with hardware changes, provided all necessary hardware is included and the hardware change can be easily performed by user.  Transducer must be able to supply at least 40W of ultrasonic power for thermosonic bonding and enough force to perform at least 64 gold stud bump bonds.  Ultrasonic collet must be heatable to at least 100C.  Ultrasonic operation must be programmable.  System programming must allow multiple forces, temperatures, and distances to be specified in a single bond profile.  Must be able to store multiple bond cycles and backup and access all files and data using standard PC storage media or network interface.  The bonder must be able to supply inert gas into the bonding area to minimize oxidation during bonding.  Must have the ability to planarize the upper and lower bonding surfaces by bringing the actual bonding surfaces into contact but without bonding in order to level the actual surfaces through the use of an air bearing, magnetic, or similar flexible universal joint.  Optical system must be capable of resolving 1-micron lines and allow the use of alignment marks separated by at least 50 mm.  Must display realtime stage position, applied force, and temperature for both upper and lower chucks.  Must have dark-field lighting for non-reflective parts.  The bonder must include a dispensing system with X-Y-Z control to dispense viscous materials such as epoxy or flux in the work area either aided by the optical system or in a programmable mode.  UV source must be included to allow in-situ curing of UV-cured epoxy.  Theta control must allow rotation of +/-20 degrees or more with a resolution of 0.002 degrees or less.  Must include a high magnification side view camera to observe bonding site or alternate feedback method to monitor bonding process to aid in process development.  Z-position must be adjustable by at least 5 mm to enable stacking multiple die.  INSTALLATION: The contractor shall provide complete system installation and conduct operational training at NRL-DC. WARRANTY: The contractor shall provide a standard commercial warranty against all parts and labor. Delivery and acceptance is at NRL, Washington, D.C. 20375, FOB Destination. Delivery shall be no later than 120 days from date of award. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror proposing the lowest price for the items that have been determined to comply with the requirements of the specifications and solicitation.  The proposal must demonstrate an understanding of the requirement and the ability to meet the specifications. Offeror must complete and submit with its proposal, FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items and DFARs 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; which are identified as B and available electronically at: http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/repsandcerts.htm.

The Government is not responsible for the amount of time required to clear unannounced visitors, visitors without proper identification and without complete information that would allow delivery (ie point of contact, telephone POC, bldg., room number, etc.)  If 24 hour notification was not provided, it is suggested that your company representative or your courier service arrive at NIST at least 90 minutes prior to the closing time in order to process entry to the campus through the visitor center and complete delivery.

Submission must be received by 3:00 p.m. local time on August 30, 2004.

The Director of Army Museums (DAM) has been tasked to plan, develop and build the National Museum of the United States Army (NMUSA).  Professional consulting services and subject matter expertise are required to support outreach, strategic planning, progra m support, and relationship management with industry, Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and other Government Organizations required to open NMUSA and the Museum Support Center by FY2009 at Fort Belvoir, VA.  The mission also requires p rofessional and support services for project management, strategic planning, studies and analyses, museum programs support, and information technology support 2.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS.   In developing the strategic plan to coordinate critical relationships and strategic alliances with Non Government Organizations (NGOs) to include academia, private industry and other critical stakeholders the contractor shall refer to the following documen ts:  AR 870-20, Army Museums, Historical Artifacts, and Art.  The Strategic Vision for the Armys Museum and Historical Program, The Museum Divisions Strategic Vision and applicable NMUSA project documents.  The government shall provide these documents up on request.            3.0	SPECIFIC TASK/REQUIREMENTS.   In order for the National Museum of the United States Army (NMUSA) to open in June 2009 as scheduled, and to operate successfully thereafter, several challenges must be met. The most significant challenges are listed below:  o	A shortage of government staff o	The need to inspire and coordinate efforts of multiple stakeholders, inside and outside the Army. o	Impending retirement of a majority of the museums workforce and the lack of modern curatorial, museum business and information technology skills across the Army Museum System workforce.    o	Mandatory integration of evolving Army and civil sector security and safety requirements into the design, development and implementation of the museum facility and its programs.   o	Rapid changes in information technology to support a virtual museum, ensure access to clients with disabilities, appropriately showcase and secure holdings as well as provide for administrative support.   To meet these challenges, the NMUSA Program government staff must be augmented with contractor expertise.  This augmentation will expand the capability of a small staff so that it can address the challenges in parallel, rather than sequentially. Specific c ontractor tasks to overcome each challenge are in succeeding paragraphs. 3.1	Task 1- Plan, Develop and Support Project Management The contractor shall provide a single program manager to coordinate all tasks under this effort.  The program manager shall provide monthly reports of progress made and of costs.  He or she shall also directly support one of the tasks and provide other rep orts required by the government. These reports include requests for travel, expenditure status, trip reports and cost projections. Deliverables: ·	In Progress Reports ·	Travel expenditure, trip, and cost projection reports 3.2	Task 2- Strategic Campaign Plan Expand and update the NMUSA Strategic Campaign Plan Phase 2.  The NMUSA Strategic Campaign Plan is a phased planning and implementation effort to identify, inform and involve every stakeholder in the coordinated support of the National Museum of the U.S. A rmy.  The current Plan identifies stakeholders and recommends actions. Significant actions have already been accomplished. These actions must be documented and followed up where required. The stakeholders are both internal and external to the U.S. Army. Internal stakeholders range from the constituent museums of the Army Museum System to Army Commands and the Headquarters Department of the Army Staff. This Army Family includes Active and Reserve Components, retired and family members, as well as the Army Historical Foundation and other veteran organizations.  External constituencies include the Congress, local and state governments who will host the NMUSA, other Defense Departments/Agencie s, related federal agencies such as the National Park Service and the Smithsonian Museum system.  Industry providers of weapons systems and services are also stakeholders, as are schools, tourist agencies and other museums.   There is a continuing need for  adequate funding in the right appropriations to develop and build NMUSA. Strategic Campaign Planning and implementation must accommodate these needs; advise on t he subject of public fundraising through the Army Historical Foundation.   This task requires extensive knowledge of the U.S. Army at every echelon, the Army Museum System, the planning, programming, budgeting and execution system, relationship planning, Congressional liaison, public affairs and strategic planning. Deliverables: ·	In Progress Reports ·	Meeting Minutes ·	Trip Reports ·	NMUSA Strategic Campaign Plan 3.3	Task 3 - Support the NMUSA Program Development Initiatives.  NMUSA has initiated programs with major museum educational centers, several underserved universities and colleges, nation-wide youth training organizations and the current workforce.   The programs provide interns, identify and ameliorate training shortfal ls in the current workforce and prepare staff for the NMUSA.   This extensive effort is phased to provide NMUSA staff with the skills to run a world class national museum that has local, virtual and traveling programs.  This task requires application of de tailed knowledge of the NMUSA Programs Development Initiatives, participants, museum knowledge and skills, youth and adult education, and nation-wide travel. The NMUSA Programs will require the full spectrum of Security, Safety, and Information Technology applications. Deliverables: ·	In Progress Reports ·	Meeting Minutes ·	Trip Reports ·	Briefing Documentation 3.4	Task 4  Security and Safety Requirements The government requires identification and integration of evolving security and safety requirements into the design, development and implementation of the museum facility and the wide array of NMUSA Programs.  NMUSA will be located within the security enve lope of Fort Belvoir, Virginia in a manner which provides maximum public access while meeting both anti-terrorism/force protection and standard museum security rules.  Army security regulations for personnel, documents, communications, information systems and physical assets are changing to match evolving threats and technological advances. Change also permeates the security practices for constructing and implementing museums.  Because the NMUSA will serve a wide and diverse audience of visitors, ranging fr om children to seniors, with interactive programs, safety is a significant factor.  This task requires identification of a baseline of Army and professional museum security and safety requirements as well as best practices in these disciplines within 90 da ys of task award.  The identification must be in a format that can be incorporated into museum design, construction and programs.  Next steps involve tracking changes to Army and museum security and safety requirements with the museum design, construction and program development process. The contractor shall recommend changes in time for them to be considered and implemented. Deliverables: ·	In Progress Reports ·	Meeting Minutes ·	Trip Reports ·	Briefing Documentation ·	Museum Security and Safety Requirements Baseline ·	Museum Security and Safety Requirements Updates 3.5	Task 5 - Information Technology assessment, validation and integration.   NMUSA uses information technology today to communicate with external audiences and for internal collaboration. Some systems are government owned, such as the time accounting system for government civilian employees and the Army Knowledge Portal. Others are  general commercial products, such as supply chain and customer relationship management that NMUSA may use. A third category is specialized systems for museum operation: security, exhibit support and access for persons with disabilities. This task builds u pon going programs to identify and evaluate current information technology in use by the NMUSA.  A baseline evaluation is due 60 days after task award. Ninety days after task award the contractor shall provide an initial, time phased assessment of informat ion technology changes that will impact ongoing operations, museum construction and museum operations.  T he contractor shall update this baseline every 90 days or more frequently to match construction and program development cycles.  The task requires expertise in DOD, Army, commercial and museum related special purpose information technology. Deliverables: ·	In Progress Reports ·	Meeting Minutes ·	Trip Reports ·	Briefing Documentation ·	Baseline Information Technology Evaluation ·	The Phased Assessment of Information Technology Changes 4.0	MINIMUM PERSONNEL REQUIRED.  The Contractor shall be responsible for assigning the minimum number of personnel necessary to provide the services for the successful execution of this contract to include a Program Manager. 5.0	SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS.

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to provide answers to additional questions received to date regarding solicitation 200-2004-Q-01613.  Question 1: What is the total number of samples that CDC expects to submit to the laboratory?  Answer 1: 123 samples for nicotine, moisture, and pH analysis (41 samples done in triplicate).  123 samples for tobacco specific nitrosamine analysis  (41 samples done in triplicate).  39 samples for metals analysis (13 samples done in triplicate).  13 samples for pesticide analysis.  Question 2: Will these samples be coming to the lab in one shipment or separate batches?  If in batches, what would be the typical size of each batch and the shipment frequency?  Answer 2:  These samples should be coming to the lab in one shipment.  Question 3:  What is the expected turn-around time for sample analysis or for project completion?  Answer 3: Six (6) months after the samples are received by the contractor.  Question 4: Are there any specific reporting requirements (e.g., required formats for QC data or tables or documentation), and if so, can you provide additional information on these requirements?   Answer 4: We request that copies of standard curves and QA/QC documentation be provided.  The format can be at the discretion of the contractor.  Question 5: Are we to be submitting reports as the work is completed or a summary report at the end of the project?  Answer 5: One report when the work is completed.  Interim reporting is not required.  Question 6: Would you require an electronic copy of the report, a hardcopy of the report, or both?  And if an electronic copy is required, do you have a preference with regard to the format (i.e., Word, WordPerfect, and so on)?   Answer 6: Electronic and hardcopy.  Electronic copy should be in Word format.  Question 7: Does our organization need to represent and certify 52.212-3(b)(3) Taxpayer Identification Number?  Answer 7: Yes.  Question 8: Is 52.212-3(g)(2) or (3) Buy American Act-Free Trade Agreements-Israeli Trade Act Certificate applicable? The solicitation does not specifically state this requirement.  Answer 8: No.  The Buy American Act-Free Trade Agreements-Israeli Trade Act Certificate is only applicable to acquisitions for supplies, or for services involving the furnishing of supplies, for use within the United States.  Since this acquisition does not require the vendor to furnish supplies to the CDC, then this certificate is not required.  Question 9: Is 52.212-3(h) Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension or Ineligibility for Award applicable? Does the contract value exceed the simplified acquisition threshold?  Answer 9: The simplified acquisition threshold is $100,000.*****

<DESC>THE DAATE AND TIME FOR THE SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS IS BEING EXTENDED TO AUGUST 31, 2004 COB  INCLUDED ARE TO THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS.  DG1350-04-RQ-0203

1.   Has this been competed before and if so who is the incumbent.

Response:  No, this is a new solicitation.  A broad customer satisfaction survey was conducted more than a year ago to serve as a generic management decision tool by generating a fundamental understanding of ITA’s services agency-wide that U.S. exporters use and find valuable.  The anonymous results served solely as a starting point to identify topical areas on which to focus subsequent program-specific improvement efforts.  This narrower solicitation is intended to help target resources directly to the most appropriate clientele segment from within the universe of private sector American export businesses that are most likely to benefit from the DOC Compliance Program.  

2. The first paragraph under Statement of Work has a sentence fragment I believe, could you clarify what may be missing.

Response:  The Department of Commerce has a requirement to provide the Agreements Compliance Unit in seeking proposals for issuing a questionnaire, hosting focus groups, and/or conducting interviews to gather strategic feedback from core and target customers.

3.   Is the bureau-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey covering all ITA program units available for bidders to review?

Response:  The ITA Customer Satisfaction Survey is not necessary to address this new solicitation.  However, as background, we will provide to the contractor a synopsis of the results that have led us to want to pursue more helpful programmatic customer feedback, once a selection is made. 
 
4. How many customers were surveyed in the prior survey and how many were TCC customers?

Response:  Over 5,000 ITA agency-wide customers were surveyed.  The responses were anonymous so there is no way to know how many TCC customers responded.  
 
5.  Do you know how many customers would be covered by the proposed survey?
 
Response:  This has not been pre-determined.  Our decision will be based upon input from selected contractors regarding recommendations for statistical sampling methodology, options provided in proposals submitted, experts advice about identification of candidates, and internal deliberations.  It is anticipated that scope of survey population will not exceed 1,000. 

6.  How many customers would be expected to participate in the focus groups?

Response:  This has not been pre-determined.  Our decision will be derived from competitive proposals submitted by potential contractors and internal discussions.  It is anticipated that magnitude of focus group population will not exceed 100.  While the universe of American exporters who might participate in focus groups is about 100, we envision 2-3 focus groups of manageable size. 

7.  Must the work be performed in Washington, D.C.?  

Response:  Off-site work will be considered, solutions in work plans can include conference call sessions, etc.  Government anticipates that at least 3-4 on-site planning and consultation meetings in ITA offices will be necessary.  If your proposed work plan includes activities not performed in Washington, travel costs should be reflected in accordance with your solution proposal.

8.  Reading this RFP, it states that the D o C Agreements Compliance unit wants to “gather feedback from core and target customers” this RFP continues saying that “a substantial customer base is unaware of the specific services”. Initially it would appear that the Dept of Commerce would supply a list of their core customers and their targeted customers but as the RFP continues and cites a customer base that is unaware of these offered services it is not clear how this customers will be identified. Will the Dept of Commerce supply the list of customers they wish to receive feedback from or are we, the consultants, expected to find participants who are involved in shipping and logistics for these focus groups?

Response: DOC will identify active customers and some prospective customers after award.  The consultants are expected to find other participants.  DOC will work with contractor to develop a profile or other means to identify additional prospective customers and discover untapped customers from among the private sector exporting business community of product manufacturers and service providers.

9. Approximately how many active customers does TCC have?

Response: The TCC has had about 500 customers from over a period of several years.
 
10.  Do previous studies exist that would allow the contractor to distinguish between prospective and untapped customers?

Response: No previous studies have been conducted on the TCC’s specific customer base.  However, TCC outreach efforts have provided some useful information, insights, and contacts for prospective customers that can be shared with contractor once selection has been made.  Likewise, public and private sector listings of untapped exporters exist from registries, directories, and representative organizations.     
 
11.  Is it possible to obtain a copy of the section of the bureau-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey conducted in 2003 that pertains to MAC?

Response: Information will be provided to contractor once a selection is made.  As background, we will provide to the successful offer a synopsis of the results that have led us to want to pursue more helpful programmatic customer feedback.
 
12. Is there a budget target and/or estimated level of effort for this work?

Response:  Government is seeking a proposed solution falling within the lower end of a simplified acquisition price range. 
13.  Who conducted the 2003 ITA survey?
Response: The CFI Group, an Accenture subcontractor.
14.   What was the contract amount for the 2003 ITA survey?
Response:  This information is not readily available.  The previous survey was part of a much broader effort.
15.  Will the Government provide the list of study participants for the survey and focus groups?  If so, what contact information will be available (i.e., name, phone, address, e-mail)?  How current is the list?
Response: DOC will identify active customers and some prospective customers after award.  Up-to-date name, phone, address, e-mail can be provided.  The consultants are expected to find other participants.  DOC will work with contractor to develop a profile or other means to identify additional prospective customers and discover untapped customers from among the private sector exporting business community of product manufacturers and service providers.
16.  What methodology was used in the 2003 ITA survey (i.e., telephone, Web, mail)?
Response:  The survey was web-based.  
17.  What was the sample size in the 2003 ITA survey?
Response:  Over 5,000 ITA agency-wide customers were surveyed.    
18.  Will the Government provide a meeting room for the focus groups?  In other words, can we meet in a DOC building, or should we budget for a focus group facility with two-way mirror?
Response:  Please budget for off-site (rental of non-government facility) focus group logistics and also provide an option for cost-savings using on-site government facility/DOC building if available.
19.  What are the sizes of the groups to be surveyed, (i.e., Active Customers, perspective Customers and Untapped customers)?  What are the specific totals for each group and for the entire population?

Response: Size has not been determined for all customer groups.  Our decision on survey size will be based upon input from selected contractors regarding recommendations for statistical sampling methodology, options provided in proposals submitted, experts advice about identification of candidates, and internal deliberations.  It is anticipated that scope of survey population will not exceed 1,000.  The TCC has had about 500 customers from over a period of several years.  DOC will identify active customers and some prospective customers after award.  TCC outreach efforts have provided some useful information, insights, and contacts for prospective customers that can be shared with contractor once selection has been made.  The consultants are expected to find other participants, from sources such as public and private sector listings of exporters that exist from registries, directories, and representative organizations. DOC will work with contractor to develop a profile or other means to identify additional prospective customers and discover untapped customers from among the private sector exporting business community of product manufacturers and service providers.

20.  Will Commerce's TCC or MAC supply the contractor with a list of possible participants from each group (i.e., Active, Prospective and Untapped Customers who can be contacted for the survey and the focus group(s) sessions?

Response: MAC/TCC will identify active customers and some prospective customers after award.  Up-to-date name, phone, address, e-mail can be provided.

DOC will work with contractor to develop a profile or other means to identify additional prospective customers and discover untapped customers from among the private sector exporting business community of product manufacturers and service providers.

21.  Is there a designated geographical specification to be included regarding the survey and focus groups or will the contractor be responsible for selecting, determining the areas and selecting the participants?

Response:  No pre-designated geographical specifications or limitations for survey or focus groups of American exporters.  Off-site work will be considered, solutions in work plans can include conference call sessions, etc.  Government anticipates that at least 3-4 on-site planning and consultation meetings in ITA offices will be necessary.  If your proposed work plan includes activities not performed in Washington, travel costs should be reflected in accordance with your solution proposal.

Statement of Work for – Assessment of DOC Compliance Program
The Department of Commerce has a requirement to provide the Agreements Compliance unit is seeking proposals for issuing a questionnaire, hosting focus groups, and/or conducting interviews to gather strategic feedback from core and target customers.  These surveys will provide reactions to MAC’s publicly available tools, informational outreach efforts, customer service regarding compliance casework, and new initiatives for exporters.

Background

In 2003, the Department of Commerce’s (DOC’s) International Trade Administration (ITA) conducted a bureau-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey covering all ITA program units.  ITA’s Market Access and Compliance (MAC) program survey report identified gaps between a high level of customer awareness yet low customer use of fair trade and market access services.  Findings also indicate that a substantial customer base is unaware of the specific services that the DOC Compliance Program offers.

In response to the survey findings, MAC is proposing to conduct a survey and/or focus groups to assess, in more specific terms and greater detail, what is MAC’s Trade Compliance Center’s (TCC’s) customers expectations.  This will enable the TCC to answer: “What Do Customers Want from the DOC’s Compliance Program?”   Information about the TCC can be found on its website at www.export.gov/tcc. 


Work Description

The Department of Commerce’s (DOC) International Trade Administration (ITA) has made great strides in monitoring ITA’s customer satisfaction and advancing a strategic approach to delivering value to its customers.  

The purpose of this Work is to obtain customer and potential customer views regarding the DOC Compliance Program to determine:
 
&#61553;	If the TCC offers the right set of services to assist U.S. exporters to overcome foreign trade barriers
 

&#61553;	If MAC is aware of exporter needs
&#61553;	If the right MAC programs are in place to meet identified needs
&#61553;	If MAC services are properly promoted to maximize efficiency and effectiveness
	
	In order to continue to monitor customer satisfaction and improve the customer experience, this work requires the following deliverables:
	
 

•	Design and administer a MAC survey based on the TCC-relevant recommendations identified during the ITA-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey
•	Development of an interview guide and conduct focus groups and/or interviews to obtain additional information regarding the survey findings and address the desired outcomes
•	Analysis and recommendations based on survey and focus group questions that address the following key issues
	
	The primary scope and outcomes from this work include the following:
 

&#61553;	Analysis of what ‘customers’ expect of Commerce compliance services and how expectations match ability of the TCC to deliver those services 
&#61553;	Recommendations on how to improve customer awareness and use of products and services (what tools & how are they used)
 

&#61553;	Identification of opportunities to increase Market Access and Compliance case intake
 

&#61553;	Identification of which monitoring and outreach tools work best and which could be improved or added (best distribution/communication channels)
&#61553;	Identification of data for areas of client demand where product or services are needed but do not exist
 

&#61553;	Analysis of customer perceptions about resolving foreign trade barriers
 

&#61553;	Analysis of what prevents potential customers from using Commerce Compliance Program services
 

&#61553;	Assessment of how well the Liaison subprogram is delivering value
 

	
	Alternatives 
	
	Market Access and Compliance is considering the two options below and requests a proposal outlining the approach, activities, and timing for executing a survey and/or focus group that will target the following customer segments:
	
 

a.	 Active customers: Existing TCC customers who will be able to comment on the effectiveness of MAC’s current programs, identify repeat business opportunities, and suggest potential improvements
b.	 Prospective customers: Exporters who are aware of the TCC, but currently do not seek assistance and will be able to provide insight regarding what would motivate them to use the TCC’s programs
c.	 Untapped customers: Exporters who are unaware of the TCC’s products and services and will be able to provide insight regarding how the TCC can best increase its customer base through awareness and promotional efforts 
	
	Option 1.  Conduct a Customer Survey and Focus Groups to Assess the Effectiveness of the Compliance Program – The contractor shall provide an outline of the specific tasks involved in administering a survey and series of focus groups/interviews, including questionnaire development, design, approval, and execution.  The purpose of the survey will be to obtain cross-TCC specific information on the customer’s needs, experience with the TCC, and overall satisfaction.  The focus groups will then use the survey findings to gain a deeper understanding of issues identified.
 

	
	Option 2.  Conduct Focus Groups Only to Assess the Effectiveness of the Compliance Program – The contractor shall clearly outline the specific tasks involved in administering a series of interactive customer focus groups, including the internal MAC preparation meetings, focus group questions, related facilitation materials.  The purpose of the focus groups will be to gain a better understanding of the issues identified in the ITA-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey.  The focus groups will also target the above-listed customer segments.  
	
	Each option shall conclude with a summary and more detailed report of the data and analysis (specify presentation medium), which will outline the primary recommendations for improving the TCC’s compliance program.

This amendment is issued as a question and answer due to technical difficulties uploading to the Q&A portion of FedBizOps:

Question:  Do you currently have a covered building with reinforced concrete slabs and concrete footings to miniimize vibration and protect against the elements being prepared by the Corps of Engineers?  If so, can you send us plans and specifications?

Answer:  There is a site picked out on Camp Salerno for the prime power plant.  This area has been grubbed and cleared of debri, but that is the extent to which our men will prepare the site.  The site is approximately 200' by 200' but can be changed depending on contractor space requirements.  There will be no construction at the site done by the Corps of Engineers.  Any set-up and designs contemplated by the contractor for the construction/manufacture of protective structures shall be performed by the contractor.

Question:  We would like to know the elevation of the site. We believe it to be in the range of 4,000 meters.  Can you confirm this?

Answer:  Salerno is at 3700 feet of elevation.
