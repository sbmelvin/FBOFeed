The project is anticipated to consist of 2 major objectives: 1) Help accelerate licit economic growth and business activity development in selected provinces in which poppy cultivation is thriving; and 2) Help provide an immediate alternative source of income to poor households whose livelihoods depend, directly or indirectly, on the temporary opium economy.

A draft Scope of Work and Evaluation Criteria have been issued for comment on the FedBizOps website and can be accessed via the following link (http://www1.eps.gov/spg/AID/OM/AFG/postdatePrevDays_1.html).

The period of performance is expected to be three years. Currently USAID estimates the cost of this program to be $330 million with approximately $250 million to be allocated to programmatic implementation. 

The RFP is expected to be issued on or about December 8, 2004. The RFP will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website. Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued and posted on the website along with the RFP.

Potential offerors are encouraged to check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) periodically. Interested vendors are invited to register on the Interested Vendors List module, particularly those interested in teaming and/or subcontracting opportunities.

<DESC>NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) requires ATLAS 3rd Generation Sensors, to replace existing instrumentation on PMEL’S NX ATLAS moorings. PMEL desires five configurations, four of which, TM, TPM, TCM and TVM, will require First Article Testing. The new subsurface instrumentation shall be small, self-contained data loggers that sample and store data at pre-determined intervals independent of other sensors or the buoy electronics. The instruments are high-accuracy temperature modules (TM) with non-volatile memory and built-in inductive modem. These modules would also have optional configurations to measure water pressure (TPM) or high-accuracy conductivity (TCM, for the computation of salinity), and a stand-alone inductive modem (SM) with external serial RS-232 interface for in-situ direct cable interconnection with other instrumentation. Additionally a high-accuracy temperature current meter (TVM) with non-volatile memory and built-in inductive modem is desired.  Overall lifecycle cost is a strong consideration, since these instruments will be used in arrays of moorings in remote locations.  The instruments shall be: (1) TM – temperature, inductive modem; (2)TPM – temperature, pressure, inductive modem; (3) TCM – temperature, conductivity, inductive modem; (4)TVM – temperature, current meter, inductive modem (5) SM – External RS-232 serial interface, inductive modem. Communication and interfacing: The instrument should provide reliable, low-cost, low-power, real-time full-duplex ASCII data transmission via an inductive modem compatible with the Seabird Electronics, Inc., DPSK (differential-phase-shift-keyed) protocol, using a single, plastic-coated, mooring cable or insulated wire. The modem and inductive coil are to be integral to the instrument. User-selectable (on pre-deployment) operating modes include:  Polled: On command, the modules takes one or more samples and transmits the data along with a time stamp; Autonomous: The modules sample data at pre-programmed intervals, storing the data in FLASH memory; Combo: Data at pre-programmed intervals is stored in FLASH memory and the SIM can request the last stored data with time stamp; Averaging (Continuous or Burst): Data at pre-programmed intervals is stored in FLASH memory. The SIM can periodically request the average (with time stamp) of the individual data stored since its last request. The period of performance will begin on date of contract award for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract type and will continue for five years. A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation may be available on or about November 16, 2004, through this website.  The approx. closing date may be 30 days after issuance of the RFP.

The Program Announcement can be found on the ESTCP Home Page accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.estcp.org/. No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards will take the form of contracts. Before preparing a pre-proposal, potential proposers should read the information pro vided in the ESTCP Program Announcement at www.estcp.org/opportunities/solicitations for details regarding the programs objectives, proposal submission requirements, deadlines, and the evaluation of proposals. ESTCP is seeking proposals for technologies f or wide area assessment of UXO-contaminated sites. ESTCP is seeking these proposals as candidates for funding in Fiscal Year (FY) 2005.  It is the intent of ESTCP to perform demonstration projects at sites chosen in conjunction with the Military Services.  ESTCP will provide descriptions of demonstration sites that match the proposed technologies, as well as additional guidance, at the time of the full proposal request.  Specific site(s) may be suggested in the pre-proposal, but this is not required or expe cted. Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a two-stage review process. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal including a signed original, plus five additional copies, refere ncing this BAA, to: Ms. Brenda Batch, ESTCP Program Office, 901 North Stuart Street, Suite 303, Arlington, VA 22203-1821 (703-696-2127).

All margins (top, bottom, left and right) should not be less than 1 inch. One attachment of up to three single-sided pages of test data may also be submitted. The cover page should be in the format specified in the ESTC P Program Announcement (see above). The pre-proposal must concisely describe what technology the proposer has to offer ESTCP, including its level of development or maturity, and its cost/benefit. The pre-proposal should use the following format (also descr ibed in the ESTCP Program Announcement and contain the following information: 1) Short Descriptive Title. 2) Technology Description: Describe the proposed technology, its capabilities and limitations.  The technology description should include the followin g information: a) Technical description and justification of proposed technologys capabilities; b) Optimal operational parameters (site geology, topography, vegetation, etc.) for the proposed demonstration. Any limitations of the technology for different sites should be explicitly described; c) Evidence the technology is mature enough for demonstration (include references and performance history); d) Any data re quirements for demonstration of the proposed technology or other support required for deployment of the technology; e) Potential issues of concern and technical risks in deploying the technology in field-testing. 3) Benefit of Technology: Quantitatively de scribe expected benefits in terms of the wide area assessment objectives of this solicitation.  Provide justification for the technologys ability to delineate target edges, definitively label portions of the site as uncontaminated, or provide information to support enhanced planning and risk assessment. 4) Schedule: Provide an expected notional schedule for the project assuming deployment to a single site.  Explicitly describe any development or adaptation work that is required prior to actual field demons tration.  Refer to Appendix A for required project deliverables. 5) Cost Estimate: Provide an estimate for the level of funding required, including any development or adaptation work.  Identification of a specific demonstration location is not required or expected for pre-proposals.  ESTCP will offer assistance in site selection.  It is expected that one of the demonstration sites will exhibit relatively benign geology, topology, and vegetation, with the other sites being more challenging in one or more of these conditions.  The cost estimate should be representative of the cost of a single deployment to a representative 10,000-acre field demonstration.  Provide a breakdown of costs in terms of pre-deployment, mobilization, data collection, and data analysis  as appropriate.  Provide an estimate for how costs will vary as a function of the site dimension.  6) Performers: List all organizations involved in the proposed demonstration and their expected contributions.  List the name and organization of the lead p erson(s) for each organization involved.  Provide as an attachment a one-page curriculum vitae for each of the principal performers (not included in the five page pre-proposal count). The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to get init ial Government feedback on their technologies without incurring the expense of a full proposal. The following evaluation factors will be the sole basis for reviewing the pre-proposal pursuant to this solicitation. Relevance and readiness for demonstration/ validation are pass/fail gates. Proposals not passing the relevance and readiness gates will not be evaluated any further. Among the evaluation factors, Technical Merit is most important, followed by Cost/Benefit, and Cost of Demonstration. More detailed d escriptions are available under the Evaluation Factors section of the ESTCP Program Announcement at www.estcp.org/opportunities/solicitations. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work.   Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by the Government, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages the submission of a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the tim e of notification.

<DESC>NA Buyer: NIH Clinical Center 10 Center Drive, B1N238 Rockville MD 20892 Reference Number: CC263-05-Q-LM-0112 Required By: 11-23-04 Delivery By: 12-16-04 Delivery FOB: Y Small Business Set-aside: Y FAR: 52.219-1 SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN REPRESENTATION 84041 SIC: 3317 FSC: 4710 Simplix Key: 86EE9M00 Delivery Destination: James Wilson; 9000 Rockville Pike; Bethesda, MD 20892 LINE ITEM 01: 1 Lot   add pneumatic tube stations in pediatric clinic, alcohol cli   nic ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS:   This is a notice of intent to award Swisslog Translogic Corp    to procure 6 inch pneumatic tubing systems in the CRC at NI   H. It was determined that the old 4 inch system already inst   alled by this company in the old Clinical Center and the ACR   F was not large enough to meet existing needs and, therefore    would be completely inappropriate once the CRC was added in   to the mixture. This is one of the reasons for the increase    to the larger size pneumatic tube systems. Once this decisio   n was made, it became important to try and have the systems    in all areas of the Clinical Center comminicate with each ot   her via the tube system. Our existing system was old and hav   ing problems and it was decided that as, and if, funding bec   ame available, the newer, better technology 6 inch system wo   uld be expanded into the various departments in the ACRF and    then into the Clinical Center itself. In order to ensure th   at there is seamless delivery via this system, it is essenti   al that all elements be installed by the same vendor. All of    the tube stations must be able to communicate and this requ   ires that they all have the same proprietary software. Also,    with the building of the CRC, Clinical Center management ha   s realized the value in standardization of equipment. Standa   rdization provides the very best way of ensuring that all em   ployees are trained and comfortable with the one system (and    not having to try and remember a number of methods of opera   tion); it also saves the Government money in that only parts    for one manufacturer must be stocked. Our government repair    personnel will be in better position to intervene for any e   mergencies if they only have to train and be proficient on o   ne type of system.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Dahlgren Division, intend to purchase through other than full and open competition from Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, services related to the integration of a Modular Wearable Computers (MOWC), which will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), with the Dragon Runner UGV and SUSS systems.  BACKGROUND:   In today's modern battle spaces, where potential enemies understand the United States strengths and capitalize on th! e asymmetric nature of specific areas, small unit leaders will increasingly enter these hostile environments and encounter life-threatening situations.  The Marine Corps Warfighting Lab recognizes that tactical units need an organic suite of unmanned low-risk system capabilities to conduct Reconnaissance Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA) in these complex environments.  It is believed that an integrated MOWC will assist this mission by providing real-time RSTA data, increasing the using unit's overall situational awareness.  This coverage, executed by an organic suite of remote sensors, and controlled/monitored off of one central MOWC, will provide observational data of confined/distant areas where human access is impractical or unsustainable, mitigating risk to the Marines normally carrying out these missions.  Fully functional prototypes of these unmanned systems (Dragon Runner UGV and SUSS) are being developed and demonstrated by the National Robotics Engineering Con! sortium, Carnegie Mellon University Robotic's Institute and the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL).  The Dragon Eye UAV, currently under system enhancement by MCWL as produced by AeroVironment, Inc, is a formal program of record within Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, VA.  The MCWL will conduct experiments to determine the efficacy of such a computer system at the Marine small unit level. BASIC REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall integrate (within 12 months of contract award) one GFE Modular Wearable Computer (MOWC) to operate both a Dragon Runner UGV and a SUSS. The Contractor shall also support integration testing of the MOWC with a vendor TBD, Inc with the Dragon Runner UGV and SUSS systems. The Contractor shall also support an Integrated Product Team (IPT) structure for the development and test phases. The contractor shall also provide all technical support during a multi-day Limited Technical Assessment (LTA) The Request for Proposal number is  N00178-05-R-1014.

The system operates during the peak visitation period from May to September.  The anticipated start date for actual bus service to begin is 05/27/05.  The Contractor is also required to be on site beginning on 05/23/05 through 05/26/05 in order to conduct and complete operational and familiarization training.  Additionally, between 05/23/05 and 05/26/05 the NPS will conduct its eight hour orientation course for Contractor personnel.  Specifics of the training and NPS orientation course will be indicated in the formal solicitation.

<ARCHDATE>02202005
<CONTACT>Mark Ross 850-235-5624 or Contracting Officer Tammy L. Biar at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Titan Corporation of San Diego, CA. for acquisition of the production of selected components that comprise the backfit kits for LCACs that underwent the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) prior to development of the C4N Reliability Improvement Program (RIP). NSWC-PC is the Systems Integration Agent (SIA), In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA), Technical Support Activity (TSA) and Software Support Activity in support of the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Navigation (C4N) program.  This requirement is for acquisition of the following components required to improve the reliability of the LCAC C4N systems. The initial acquisition will be for two (2) sets of the components with options for an additional twenty nine (29) sets. The components are: Navigation Processor (one per set), Universal Keyboard (UKB) Pro! cessor (one per set), IP based Common Data Recorder (one per set), Redundant Ethernet Switch Assembly (one per set), 4x4 UKB Keypad (one per set), Operator Display Panel (ODP) (one per set).  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  These components were uniquely designed by Titan Corporation for the LCAC C4N RIP and are not commercially available. Titan Corporation also built the first prototypes for testing. The prototype RIP hardware has undergone environmental qualification testing (EQT) in the 1st Qtr of FY04 and Titan is currently refining the design based on the results of these tests.  The items being procured are required to be compatible with existing LCAC equipment.  The RIP equipment specified above is 100% compatible with the existing LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) equipment.  Software (embedded operating systems, operational flight software and offline diagnostics) has been developed and tested with th! e new RIP hardware configuration.  Maintenance and operator training have also been developed for the LCAC C4N RIP configuration as well.  Technical manual updates are being performed to match the new RIP hardware configuration.    Therefore it is in the Government’s best interest to purchase the equipment from Titan Corporation that will allow for re-use of the developed software, training and qualified hardware as well as being compatible with other existing C4N equipment. While drawings were developed for the equipment they are insufficiently detailed at this point to support competitive acquisition of the components.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division intends on acquiring for Device 15F8H Serial Number 4 and Serial Number 5, high level architecture (HLA) integration for the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 Weapons Systems Trainer (WST) to support distributed training exercises by July 2006, located at Naval Station Norfolk, VA and Naval Air Station Pt Mugu, CA.  The Navy wants these trainers to be interoperable utilizing HLA.  HLA integration into the WST is a hardware and software modification to both trainers.  As the Government does not, and will not, timely possess an accepted and validated technical data package to pursue a competitive acquisition strategy, it intends on pursuing a sole-source acquisition strategy to NLX Corporation, Sterling, VA.  NLX Corporation is currently tasked under contract N61339-99-C-0084 to design, develop and fabricate a Hawkeye 2000 WST (Device 15F8H Serial Number 5) which is a follow-on to Device 15F8H S/N 4. However, the Device 15F8H Serial Number 5 tasking is inclusive of the design, development and integration of the full Hawkeye 2000 configuration whereas the Device 15F8H Serial Number 4 tasking does not possess these enhancements. This undertaking will retrofit the enhancements into Device 15F8H Serial Number 4.  All questions and information should be directed to Contract Specialist, Linda Hill, via email at linda.a.hill@navy.mil or by phone 407-380-4107.  See Note 22.

<CONTACT>Linda Hook, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-8371, Fax 410-786-9922, Email LHook@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated to Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research of North Carolina to provide regular updates to a software system that identifies physicians located in a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) who are eligible for HPSA bonus payments.  

Sections 413(a) and 413(b) of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 require revisions to the current HPSA bonus process.  Currently, Medicare carriers pay the HPSA bonus based on the inclusion of a modifier with the service when it is billed.  Designations of the HPSA bonus areas are based on determinations of primary care and mental health rural and urban whole and part county geographic HPSAs made by The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).  These designations may be by county, census tract, township, etc. Based on the legislation that policy will be revised to no longer require the modifier for services rendered in zip code areas that fully fall within a designated HPSA area or are classified as dominant according to the United States Postal Service (USPS).  Services provided in areas that are eligible for the bonus, but do not fully fall within a HPSA bonus area, must still be submitted with the modifier.  In order to pay the physician bonus, The Centers For Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must provide to the Medicare carriers and standard systems lists of the zip codes for which the bonuses may be paid.  Under an existing contract, Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research developed a product to identify zip codes for which physicians will automatically be eligible for bonus payments.  

CMS intends to issue a sole source contract for the continued support of this system.  Under this contract, Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research will be required to provide regular updates to the product that can easily be utilized by the Medicare standard systems and carriers and also be added to the CMS website, as well as develop a process to test the zip code files to verify that the zip codes are correctly linked to the geographic areas.  It is imperative that CMS have a contractor that has total knowledge of the development of HPSAs as well as the geography of both HPSAs and ZIP code areas, experience with the relational file structure of the HPSA designations and corresponding Geographic Information System (GIS) files, how each is defined, and how each changes over time.  This contract will be awarded for a period of 1 year with four optional years.  This is a notice of intent and not a request for proposals.  Businesses that recognize and can provide the required service described above must provide supporting evidence.  The Government will consider all responses received within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Intramural Research Program of the NINDS, EEG Section intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Nihon Kohden (America) Inc, 90 Icon St, Foothill Ranch, CA 92610 for a Nihon Kohden Neurofax EEG-9200 EEG machine.  The NINDS, EEG Section provides research collaboration and diagnostic electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to the entire NIH patient population.  The Nihon Kohden Neurofax EEG-9200 will replace the EEG Section’s Nihon Kohden 2100 EEG System.  The 2100 EEG System has been used for many years and is storing a significant quantity of recorded data, but has become nonfunctioning.  In order to maintain continuity in terms of data acquisition and analysis format, the new system must be procured from Nihon Kohden.  The new EEG-9200 will provide enhanced features that where not available on the existing 2100 EEG as well as having the ability to retrieve the previously collected data from NINDS EEG-2100.  The 9200 EEG system is able to monitor the recorded EEG while the system continues to record live signal.  The network feature facilitates the transfer of data electronically to a reading station, where the data can be archived, streamlining data acquisition and analysis, enhancing NINDS data processing speed capability.  The system comes with software that enables the NINDS researcher to analyze spikes and frequency spectra in addition to the basic EEG viewing and analyzing capability.  Nihon Kohden is the only source known to the NINDS researcher that has the aforementioned features and will be capable of maintaining consistency in  data acquisition and analyses format and be capable of retrieving  the  previously collected data stored on the NINDS Government owned non-functioning Nihon Kohden EEG-2100.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NINDS researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on December 1, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), a non-profit organization, to provide a performance consortium for the implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and related performance based management initiatives.

This acquisition will serve as the contract vehicle for other Federal Agencies that are joining the consortium.  This consortium will address (1) Integrating the major legislative and administrative requirements related to improving government performance (i.e., GPRA, the Chief Financial Officer’s Act, and the Clinger-Cohen Act, (2) Developing effective congress/agency processes under a performance based management system requiring a higher level of coordination, cooperation, and prioritization, (3) Establishing core agency capacities (i.e., skills, staff, resources, organizational models, process guidelines) to design, install, and effectively use performance based management techniques, (4) Establishing best practices for strategic planning that includes a capacity for long term strategic planning, annual planning that supports strategic planning, and a continuous focus on the strategic aspects of management in everyday management activity, (5) Identifying characteristics of outcome measures and measurement processes that are cost effective, practical to implement, useful to those who work with them, and have the overall effect of improving performance, (6) Establishing a regular Performance Leadership Forum through which consortium members may meet, discuss, and define emerging issues in GPRA implementation and (7) Provide tailored assistance to individual agencies within the broad area of performance based management, including strategic planning and performance measurement, as included in GPRA and related initiatives.  NAPA can provide this information within a tightened efficient timeframe.  NAPA’s Congressional Charter makes them uniquely qualified to reach across Federal Agencies for this type of service.  Reference to NAPA’s charter can be found in the Code of Federal Regulation 36 U.S.C. chapter 1501.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>****Reason for this modification to FEDBIZOPPS notice is as follows: 
Delete:  “Communication and interfacing: The instrument should provide reliable, low-cost, low-power, real-time full-duplex ASCII data transmission via an inductive modem compatible with the Seabird Electronics, Inc.” 

Add:  “Communication and interfacing: The instrument should provide reliable, low-cost, low-power, real-time half-duplex  ASCII data transmission via an inductive modem compatible with the Seabird Electronics, Inc.” 

NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) requires ATLAS 3rd Generation Sensors, to replace existing instrumentation on PMEL’S NX ATLAS moorings. PMEL desires five configurations, four of which, TM, TPM, TCM and TVM, will require First Article Testing. The new subsurface instrumentation shall be small, self-contained data loggers that sample and store data at pre-determined intervals independent of other sensors or the buoy electronics. The instruments are high-accuracy temperature modules (TM) with non-volatile memory and built-in inductive modem. These modules would also have optional configurations to measure water pressure (TPM) or high-accuracy conductivity (TCM, for the computation of salinity), and a stand-alone inductive modem (SM) with external serial RS-232 interface for in-situ direct cable interconnection with other instrumentation. Additionally a high-accuracy temperature current meter (TVM) with non-volatile memory and built-in inductive modem is desired.  Overall lifecycle cost is a strong consideration, since these instruments will be used in arrays of moorings in remote locations.  The instruments shall be: (1) TM – temperature, inductive modem; (2)TPM – temperature, pressure, inductive modem; (3) TCM – temperature, conductivity, inductive modem; (4)TVM – temperature, current meter, inductive modem (5) SM – External RS-232 serial interface, inductive modem. Communication and interfacing: The instrument should provide reliable, low-cost, low-power, real-time full-duplex ASCII data transmission via an inductive modem compatible with the Seabird Electronics, Inc., DPSK (differential-phase-shift-keyed) protocol, using a single, plastic-coated, mooring cable or insulated wire. The modem and inductive coil are to be integral to the instrument. User-selectable (on pre-deployment) operating modes include:  Polled: On command, the modules takes one or more samples and transmits the data along with a time stamp; Autonomous: The modules sample data at pre-programmed intervals, storing the data in FLASH memory; Combo: Data at pre-programmed intervals is stored in FLASH memory and the SIM can request the last stored data with time stamp; Averaging (Continuous or Burst): Data at pre-programmed intervals is stored in FLASH memory. The SIM can periodically request the average (with time stamp) of the individual data stored since its last request. The period of performance will begin on date of contract award for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract type and will continue for five years. A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation may be available on or about November 16, 2004, through this website.  The approx. closing date may be 30 days after issuance of the RFP.  

Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION and REGISTER AS AN INTERESTED VENDOR feature which provides notification when the RFP becomes available for download and all postings associated with the solicitation.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile, or written requests will be accepted.  It is incumbent upon interested parties to register at the solicitation's site for notification and to review the site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  Technical questions regarding this solicitation should be addressed in writing to Carla.A.Echols@noaa.gov.  All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which will be considere

Request for Proposals (RFP) (Stage I Technical Proposals) for the Interior Renovation of the Federal Building, 210 Walnut, Des Moines, IA. 

The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. The following document describes the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services Contract for the proposed Interior Renovation of the Federal Building located in Des Moines, Iowa. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services. A Fixed-Price contract under FAR 16.202-1 is contemplated. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs). 

Project Summary: The Federal Building is located at 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa. The project consists of approximately 390,000 gross square feet while containing approximately 263,500 occupiable square feet.  Approximately forty federal agencies occupy the Federal Building.  Another project is presently underway and involves the Repair and Alteration of the facade of floors 2 through 10, including the penthouse and roof.  The exterior facade replacement project addresses air and water infiltration though the building envelope, and is expected to be complete January 2005.  The Interior Renovation Project addresses interior renovation and upgrades systems and spaces to improve a variety of issues including abatement of hazardous materials including asbestos and lead paint, mechanical system upgrades, electrical system upgrades, modernization of tenant spaces, ADA upgrades including restrooms, and progressive collapse upgrades.  Also included in the Interior Renovation Project is the renovation and replacement of the facade on the first floor, construction of entries / lobbies / plazas and vertical transportation.  Construction will be in multiple phases as tenants are relocated to provide vacant floors for each phase (the government plans to vacate two to three floors to allow for construction and anticipates the project will include four phases, with construction lasting no longer than 4 years). Total construction costs including all phases are estimated at $35,000,000 to $50,000,000.  

Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor. A Construction Manager as Constructor: or CMc, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer, GSAs A-E firm, as well as other GSA consultants. (NOTE: A-E firm has been selected but no contract has been negotiated or awarded at this time.) 

Proposal Submission Requirements: Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, advisory multi-step process (FAR 15.202). Stage I of the RFP will contain an explanation of the entire selection process, including the evaluation factors for Stage I and Stage II of the Request for Proposals (RFP). Under Stage I, offerors must submit information regarding the firm's qualifications, past performance, past experience, proposed personnel, experience with electronic project management (e-PM) and factors identified in the RFP. All information submitted concerning a joint venture should clearly identify roles and responsibilities within the joint venture.  Submissions shall clearly address the rating factors identified in the Stage I RFP. The evaluation criteria elements for Stage I are as follows:  Past Performance as Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc), or Traditional General Contractor (360 points); Past Performance with Preconstruction Phase Services on Similar Projects (180 points); Past Performance for CMc or General Contractor within the Greater Des Moines, Iowa Area (120 points); Qualifications and Experience of the Four (4) Key Personnel (160 points); Experience in the Greater Des Moines Area with General Construction and Pre-construction Services on Similar Projects (150 points); Experience in Use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (20 points); Experience with Building Owner as Full Partner (20 points); Experience with Value Engineering  (20 points); CMcs Use of Current Project Management Technology (20 points); and Project Specific Knowledge (50 points).  

Stage I Request for Proposals will be issued on or about December 6, 2004.    

The Government will evaluate Stage I of the RFP submissions to identify and advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors. The Government shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the Stage I of the RFP, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The Government shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The Government shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the next stage of the acquisition. The evaluation criteria elements for Stage II are as follows:  Project Management Staffing Plan (40 points); CMcs Remaining Qualification and Experience of Key Personnel (170 points); Quality Control Plan (20 points); Network Analysis Schedule (40 points); Safety Plan (20 points); Track and Control Costs (20 points); Processing Correspondence/Dealing with Issues (20 points); Utilization of (Sustainable) Methods and Materials (20 points); and Oral Presentation (50 points).  Offerors must submit a Detailed Project Management Plan, Oral Presentation, Price Proposals and Subcontracting Plans under Stage II of the RFP. All Stage II respondents shall provide a brief written narrative of their outreach efforts to utilize small disadvantaged and small women-owned businesses on this project. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum goals for all subcontracted work: 39% for Small Business (SB) which includes 3% for HUBZone Small Business (HZSB), 6% for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), 5% for Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), and 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) that includes 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) for Fiscal Year 2004. An acceptable Subcontracting Plan shall be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business. (Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.) Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13. FAR Clause 52.219-4 - Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply. Offers from Small disadvantaged business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.12. FAR Clause 52.219-23 - Notice of Price Evaluation Adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns shall apply. The Stage II evaluation will be based on technical factors as well as price; however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. The Government reserves the right to make an award based on the evaluation of the Stage II submittals without holding discussions.  Pre-Construction Services are anticipated to be awarded the summer of 2005.  Options for Construction Phase Services will be exercised if the Government chooses, and if the CMc contractors performance is satisfactory.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) has provided more than $114 million in FY 2003 and 2004 to support humanitarian needs in Iraq, including delivering essential medicines to healthcare facilities, providing emergency health services, and rehabilitating water treatment and sewage plants, clinics, hospitals, and schools.  

OFDA expects a new allocation of $70 million in Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Funds (IRRF) through FY 2006 to respond to the needs of up to one million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq, as well as vulnerable populations in communities hosting IDPs.  Interventions aimed at reducing mortality, morbidity, and economic impact associated with displacement will help meet immediate needs, support the longer-term goal of enhancing stability within Iraq and facilitate the return of IDPs to non-contentious areas. OFDA currently has seven international Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) and International Organization (IO) partners, and plans to issue an Annual Program Statement soliciting new proposals to expand implementing capacity.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

<SUBJECT>16 -- Technical Criteria for Gearbox Second Source Market Survey
<SOLNBR>FA8202-05-R-AAAA
<RESPDATE>122004
<ARCHDATE>03202005
<CONTACT>Marilee Barnes, Contracting Officer, Phone 801-586-1707, Fax 801-775-5339, Email marilee.barnes@hill.af.mil
<DESC>The T-38 Aircraft Mounted Accessory Drive (AMAD) gearbox is a critical component for operation of the aircraft.  It drives the hydraulic pumps and the generators that are used for virtually all controls and instruments on the aircraft.  The following criteria are essential for any source of supply in order to maintain the highest reliability and the most dependable supply line possible:

1.  Overhaul Procedures:  All overhaul procedures are governed by T.O. 16G1-102-3. The internal oil pump is governed by T.O. 7J4-2-34-3. Any source must have the capability to perform all of the functions described in the T.O.s including inspection and testing capabilities.  The source must have all special tools required for overhaul as called out in the subject T.O.s.  A quality control program must be in place to ensure compliance with T.O.s.  

3.  Test Stand Requirements:  Both static and dynamic test stands must be able to meet all test requirements called out in the subject T.O.s.  The test results must be repeatable.  All instruments used on the test stands must read to the proper resolution and be routinely calibrated.  Safeguards must be present to prevent improper use, damage, or overloading of the gearbox.  The dynamic test stand must not impose additional vibration loads on the gearbox.  The configuration and operating procedures of the test stands must be thoroughly documented including all maintenance, calibration, and training requirements.  Test results must be documented and filed for future review.  The USAF currently uses an automated dynamic test stand which ensures that the operator has complied with all test requirements and is currently developing an automated static test stand for the same purpose.  

3.  Production rate:  The USAF facility is currently capable of producing 100+ units per quarter.  The current demand is approximately 25 units per quarter.  Any source must be capable of producing at an equivalent rate in order to support surges to the system.  The source must also be prepared to endure periods of very low demand as well.

4.  Supply chain capability:  The parts list for the gearbox is contained in T.O. 16G1-102-4. Many components in the gearbox may be reused depending on condition; however there are many others that require 100% replacement.  The source must be capable of maintaining an adequate volume of parts in stock to support production rate as described above.

5.  Discrepancy Report (DR) investigation capability – The source must be prepared to conduct a failure investigation on all gearboxes received from the field which failed prematurely.  This is important because it is the first opportunity to discover materiel deficiencies.  Materiel deficiencies which are not detected early, have the potential of causing significant down time for the end user.
 
6.  Design Improvements – Any source must be able to support ongoing research to extend service life and reduce premature failures.  The USAF facility is in the process of implementing narrow band vibration analysis.  This is tool used to evaluate the condition of many components in the gearbox such bearings, gears, shafts, etc.  The USAF will eventually implement limits based on narrow band vibration analysis.  The USAF is also investigating the implementation of an oil analysis program as another tool to identify problems and monitor the quality of the gearboxes. 

Any questions or inquiries please contact Marilee Barnes/Contracting Officer @ 801-586-1707

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to the feasibility of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Rear Ground Handling Wheel (RGHW).  The RGHW is planned to be used on the following H-1 Model aircraft (AH-1W, AH-1Z, UH-1N, UH-1Y, HH-1N).  A pair (two) RGHW units are required to lift the aircraft from attachment points located on the rear of the 4 inch diameter aircraft skids.  Skid lugs provide the interface for attachment.  The dimensions, constraints and sketches for the skid lug and each aircraft will be provide upon request.  RGHW installation and removal from the aircraft should not require any special tooling, disassembly or assembly.  Rapid installation and removal by one person is required.  Maximum safe working limits for the RGHW are required to meet a maximum aircraft weight of 20,000 lbs.  The RGHW should allow for easy transport, by one person in a standing/walking position, to and from the aircraft.  It is desired that overall weight of the RGHW be keep to a minimum.  The target weight for a RGHW unit is 90 lbs or less.  RGHW should feature non-castering pneumatic wheels, which are suitable for towing speeds up to 10 MPH on pavement, shipboard non-skid decking and unmade surfaces such as gravel, dirt and stone.  The RGHW is required to lift the aircraft to a minimum height of 3.5 inches measured from the ground to the bottom of the skid at a point between the attachment skid lugs.  The RGHW lifting mechanism should not require external power (such as electric or pneumatic).  Actuation of the lifting mechanism, by one person, per RGHW unit, is a requirement. The RGHW is required to have a mechanism to allow the rapid lowering of the skids to the ground.  The target time to completely lower the skids is 3 seconds.  The RGHW requires a method for remote activation of the rapid lowing mechanism, which can be reached by one person during aircraft towing or spotting.  The remote activation device should be designed to fit the smallest RGHW envelope dimensions for stowage.  The remote activation device should not require any tooling to install on, or remove from, the RGHW.  When installed, the remote actuation device should be accessible at a target distance of 36 inches from the RGHW center and at a target height of 24 inches from the ground.  Location of the remote actuation device is limited due to aircraft configurations.  Access to the remote actuation device should be in line with the skid tube and either forward or aft of the RGHW.  A design goal is to have a remote activation device that can be positioned either forward or aft of the RGHW.  The envelope dimensions for the RGHW unit, not including the remote activation device is available upon request.  Note that there are multiple aircraft configurations that will limit the envelope dimensions.

Please provide commercial pamphlets, operating and maintenance manual or any other documentation that would describe a unit/s or system/s to meet the above requirement.  It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 12/10/04 to Ms. Nancy Delaney, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25221B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, or by electronic mail at: Nancy.Delaney@navy.mil.  Ms. Delaney may be reached at (732) 323-4478.  Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from the RFI.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent with costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The U.S.Army RDECOM-ARDEC is seeking to identify potential sources for innovative packaging designs for 5.56mm ammunition. Easing and improving the  soldier’s ability to carry/ deploy small caliber ammunition will be the primary  goal of any proposed solution.  Additionally, reduction of packaging layers  leading to improvements of pack out in the load plant is a secondary goal.   Ammunition lifecycle cost reduction is also a consideration.  Presently, the Logistics Research and Engineering Directorate (LRED),   Packaging Division is pursuing the following packaging solutions: - M2A1 Consolidator that may eliminate the need for the wirebound box - Elimination of M8 Bandoleer and carton through the use of alternate carrying  and soldier/squad-distribution methods The above are merely examples of ongoing programs and should in no way limit  the scope of submissions to this office.  Commercially available items that are  mass producible and lend themselves to automation are preferred.  A chart showing all present packaging configurations may be obtained from the  POC listed below.  Proposed solutions should be directed at the lines  highlighted in that chart in Orange that are presently being produced at Lake  City Army Ammunition Plant. Submissions should include, but not be limited to:  A brief cost estimate for  purchase of the item in bulk to support ammunition production in the millions;  suggested manufacturing processes and costs associated with implementation;  advantages relating to cost, transportation, and storage improvements  throughout the logistics life cycle of the ammunition item; and finally,  tactical advantages to the soldier in the field. Interested parties should also include a brief summary of the company’s  capabilities, i.e.; description of facilities, personnel, past production  experience and environmental compliance as it relates to the product(s).  Interested firms should provide the manufacturer’s name, address of production  facility, pilot plant facility, and administrative building, point-of-contact  with telephone number and e-mail address for each location, and size of  business (small/large).

<SUBJECT>A--Performing a two-year, two-part project to identify Gila River basin streams that are fishless or occupied only by native fishes.
<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS AND REQUEST FOR QUOTE The Fish and Wildlife Service anticipates entering into a contract with a suitable contractor, hereinafter referred to as "Contractor" and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, hereinafter referred to as "Service." Contractor will perform a two-year, two-part project to identify Gila River basin streams that are fishless or occupied only by native fishes.  HISTORY: Fish & Wildlife Service and other personnel from academia, state and federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, and other entities have repeatedly sampled and recorded the fauna of many Gila River basin streams in Arizona and New Mexico.  Native species now are extirpated from some places and most reaches have mixed faunas of native and non-native fishes.  A few streams have intact native communities absent an introduced component, and some apparently were fishless, at least at time(s) of visitation.  There also are some waters that have not recently, or in some cases ever, been sampled comprehensively.  Among the last three kinds of streams, fishless, native only, and unsampled, there may be some where suitable habitat is available for possible establishment or re-establishment of one or more native fish species, including threatened loach minnow and spikedace.  Such sites may be especially amenable to native fish management because they may not require a barrier to protect the fauna or renovation to remove an unwanted non-native species or community.   Purpose: A contractor and the Fish & Wildlife Service anticipate to perform a two-year, two-part study to identify Gila River basin streams that are fishless, native only, or unsampled.  This work is a fundamental prerequisite to transferring native species into such streams to establish new populations, replicate existing ones, or repatriate populations that have been extirpated.    Objective: Objective of the contract is to identify fishless and native only streams in the Gila River basin.  This objective is to be met by successful completion of the following general tasks: (1) review available data bases and published and agency collection records, and interview knowledgeable professionals and lay persons to identify potential streams (fishless, native only, or unsampled), (2) design a field protocol to perform fish collections that verify fish occurrence or absence in streams identified in Task 1, and (3) implement the protocol developed under Task 2. The Service in cooperation with contractor and the Central Arizona Project Fund Transfer (CAP) Technical Committee will determine final site selections for sampling.  Specific objectives to be accomplished under each general task are provided below.  Scope of Work: Contractor shall perform a comprehensive review of published and unpublished databases, published literature, and gray literature to include agency and contract reports, files, web sites, and other materials.  From this information contractor will specifically identify streams or stream reaches that are thought to be fishless, occupied only by native fishes, or that have never or not recently been sampled.  Contractor will augment this information through interviews with knowledgeable professionals and other individuals.  Contractor will identify potential streams or stream reaches that meet the above criteria on 7.5-minute topographic maps. Task 1.)  Contractor will develop a generalized field protocol to verify the status of potential streams and stream reaches identified in Task 1 as fishless, native only, or unsampled.  The protocol will incorporate schedule and timing, methods, data recording and management, personnel requirements, and equipment needs.  It is anticipated that each stream site will be sampled more than once and that collections will be made when conditions are suitable (i.e., periods of high discharge, runoff, inclement weather, etc. are to be avoided).  Contractor will submit the draft field protocol to the Service, and incorporate Service comments and suggestions into a final protocol that will guide conduct under Task 3.  Protocol should be generally applicable across all streams of the Gila River basin upstream of and including the Hassayampa River subbasin.  The Service in cooperation with Contractor and CAP Technical Committee will make the final site selections.  It is anticipated that changes in the protocol may be necessary during the course of field studies, and such changes should be communicated to the Service at Contractor's earliest convenience.  The Service does not anticipate a need for field surveys in the Verde and Blue river drainages, as relatively recent comprehensive surveys there have been accomplished.  However, relevant data reviews of those drainages are to be included in the final report. Task 2.)  Contractor will perform field studies according to the protocol and site selections developed under Task 2.  Sampling is to be opportunistic and intensive with the primary purpose of detecting and identifying fishes present.  Contractor will maintain contact with and apprise Service of progress, problems encountered, and solutions to problems.  Contractor must have appropriate permits and permissions in hand when conducting field operations.  For example, a scientific collection permit issued by Arizona Game and Fish Department is required to authorize fish collections in the state, and other authorizations may be required by other permitting entities.  It is Contractor's responsibility to be aware of and comply with all such requirements.  Further, it is Contractor's responsibility to obtain permission, preferably in writing, to access and sample on private lands, Native American reservations, or anywhere else that such permission is required.  Task 3.)  Contractor will prepare a draft Final Performance Report for the Service that incorporates all methods, results, analyses, conclusions, recommendations and other materials derived from completion of Tasks 1-3.  The report will include a tabulation of all streams and stream reaches reviewed (Task 1) and indicate the fish community status for each (i.e., non-native only, mixed native-non-native, native only, fishless) on the basis of that review, and also indicate the actual status of each stream-stream reach based on the field surveys performed as part of Task 3.  All streams and stream reaches will be identified on 7.5 minutes topographic maps and related by stream or stream reach name to the tabulation.  The field protocol (Task 2) and any modifications thereto, or adjustments made during the course of the study, will be incorporated into the report. The Service will: a. Provide technical coordination and consultation within the Service, Contractor, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and other cooperating entities to exchange information and optimize the probability of successful completion of the project.  b. Be available as necessary to meet with Contractor to discuss progress and results.     c. Provide timely review of and comments on the Field Protocol developed under Task 2. d. Provide site selections for field surveys.  e. Provide timely review of the draft final performance report. Pricing shall include delivery and all applicable local, state, and federal taxes.

<SUBJECT>R -- Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) plans to enter into a sole source contract, with MS Technologies Corporation for routine and preventive maintenance of the Center for Retirement and Insurance Service’s Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System.  

The contractor will be required to provide routine and preventive maintenance as well as software and hardware upgrades that will be preformed during non business hours that will not effect system operations.  The contractor will perform software upgrades remotely or on-site as needed.  The contractor will provide documentation for software and hardware upgrades us prior to the actual upgrades.  The contractor will provide documentation of any software bugs or fixes once resolved.  

To award this contract to another contractor will void the current maintenance agreement on the system, and require us to purchase another telephone system which will be a considerable cost to the government and its customers. MS technologies is the only known licensed dealer that’s authorized to sell, distribute and maintain the IVR System.  It would be inefficient to issue a new contract to another firm because they would have to repeat the work that has been performed by MS Technologies and gain knowledge of the operations of the IVR System.  

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement are invited to submit in writing, within 15 days of publication of this notice, a capability statement describing their ability to provide these services.  Such information should contain pricing information for providing these services.  We will not pay for information provided.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  Interested vendors are requested to contact the OPM Contracting Officer, Toni Campbell at Antoinette.Campbell@opm.gov or by fax 202 606-0910.

Offerors are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Therefore, all items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary or personnel information must be clearly marked.  Marking of these items will not necessarily preclude disclosure when the US Office of Personnel Management (or The Government) determines disclosure is warranted by FOIA.  However, if such items are not marked, all information contained within the submitted documents will be deemed to be releasable.

--------------------------------------------------
STATEMENT OF WORK- F73ADR43001100

1.  Provide the formal training at contractor’s location (training facility).  This training is off-the-shelf type, not dedicated training.  Current needs are MicroSoft courses to include but not limited to Developing ADO.NET Applications for SQL Server; Administering MS SQL Server 2000 Database; Implementing & Supporting MS WIN XP Pro; Managing MS WIN Server 2003 Environment; Programming w/ MS VB.NET; Intro to C# Programming w/ MS.NET; Implementing & Administering Security in a MS WIN 2003 Network; Developing ASP.NET Web Apps w Visual Studio; Programming w/ MS.NET Framework Visual C#; Programming w/ MS ADO.NET; Developing XML Web Services Using MS ASP.NET; MS Project Courses;  and Computing Technology Industry Association (Comp TIA) Courses to include A+ Certification Operating Systems; A+ Certification Hardware;  Security+ Certification Training
The courses named are current needs, but the customer reserves the right to substitute like courses offered by the contractor or delete courses if requirements change.  This “clause” is necessary due to the constant changing of Information Technology courses.  For instance, today a course could be offered called Supporting ABC Software, but six months from now ABC Software is replaced by DEF Software, customer would need the “updated” course.  The other possibility for substituting courses would be loss and gain of personnel during contract period; the new person may have need for different course.

2.  These proposed courses vary in course length (two to five-days), so the contractor will bid on a per-day price.  In other words, the contractor will price courses by category (line item) by day, for instance CISCO $525 per day, meaning any 5-day CISCO course would be $2,625 and any 3-day course would be $1575.  THE PRICES LISTED ARE USED AS EXAMPLES ONLY.  The customer would arrange for courses until all “days” were used.  Due to current and changing mission requirements, the number of students and number of different courses to be taken simultaneously cannot be determined.  In the past, contractors have offered schedules (open to public) for courses requested and customer arranged attendance as they could permit release of personnel.  No guarantee of participation in scheduled classes is made until customer makes such arrangements, but even then, customer reserves the right to cancel (even last minute) due to military necessity.  The customer wants to be able to send students to attend courses offered in the Montgomery area after providing the contractor with adequate advanced notice (two weeks).  Courses will have open enrollment, not solely dedicated to the customer.  NOTE:  If there are two separate MicroSoft line items, the separation is only due to different funding.  The courses identified are the same for both lines and all stipulations of the Statement of Work apply.

3.  Course Objectives:

a.	Receive training state-of-the-art training from certified instructors.  Most of these courses have an official curriculum from the “parent company” (i.e. MicroSoft, Cisco) that needs to be utilized.  
b.	Each of these off-the-shelf courses also have objectives outlined.  Customer expects to receive hands-on knowledge to better perform daily work related tasks.  Actual certification is not a goal, but if part of the course, it is expected.  If an additional charge is involved for certification, it would be the responsibility of each student. 

4.  Contractor is expected to provide all equipment, course materials, handouts, books and other related items as customary for each course.  Contractor is expected to provide a local facility (Montgomery area) for this training.  The cost of these items should be reflected in the contractor’s price.  Training should be offered on a standard workday basis (Monday through Friday 0730-1630 hours or close to that).  If some classes are offered after hours, the customer may provide students.

5.  Requested Date:  To be determined after award of contract. Courses will be completed within one year.

6.  The quantity of days of training listed is the current need.  If courses (days) need to be cancelled, the contract will be modified reducing the number of days accordingly and corresponding funding.

7.  The contractor will be responsible for determining the number of students (both customer’s and outside) per class.

<DESC>Questions and Answers USAID RFP TRN-05-002   
U. S. Warehouse for Title II Food Commodities

Questions and answers: 
1.	Will the goods be received by SKU number?  USAID plans to use the USDA “Notice to Deliver” (ND) numbers (numbers assigned to different USDA vendor shipments) or a similar process to assigned specific numbers to each lot of commodities that are stored at the warehouse facility.  This number will be assigned early in the process and will be on various documents that arrive with the shipments.  In addition to this number, rail car or conveyance numbers will also be used to track commodities for reports, inspections, fumigation and re-delivery.

2.	Will we receive “in case” lots or “pallet” lots? You will receive commodities in tonnage or parcel lots by rail cars or truck trailers.  ND numbers will be on the documentation and the contractor will track rail car or conveyance numbers.

3.	Will pallets have mixed SKUs on them?  The solicitation specifies that commodities will be delivered and re-delivered in ND lots.  Each rail car or conveyance should contain commodities shipped under a specific ND number.

4.	When shipping outbound, will we ship by individual SKU, case lot or pallet lot?  The solicitation specifies that the contractor will ship outbound in tonnage or parcel lots by ND numbers and perhaps also by inbound rail or conveyance numbers.

5.	Will we be required to mix SKU's on a pallet?  No.

6.	When shipping outbound, will you have a required date for delivery to the stated consignee?  Yes, and the time required for outbound delivery, whether F.o.b. origin or F.a.s. vessel, will be consistent with notice, inspection and transport circumstances.

7.	Can you identify the incumbent contractor and the location and copy of the current price or rate structure?  There is no USAID incumbent contractor.

8.	Can the warehouse facility be shared with others or do you want exclusive use of the facility?  You may share the warehouse facility with others, subject to the restriction that the other commodities are not injurious to food commodities. In addition, other commodities may not be commingled with the USAID Title II commodities.

9.	Will we use our Warehouse Management System software or do you supply one?  You may use your warehouse management system software to the extent that it complies with the USAID record management requirements.

10.	How will outbound orders be received?  You will receive written instructions from the USAID Contract Technical Officer (CTO) that commodities are being purchased for delivery to the warehouse facility.  Subsequent notices will inform the warehouse contractor that commodity vendors will ship commodities during a certain period.  The warehouse contractor will coordinate with the commodity vendors to plan shipments and track deliveries.

11.	Do you want a web site furnished for direct entry into the contractor's management system?  An internet-based warehouse management system is not a requirement under this contract.

12.	Will all shipments arrive at the warehouse via truckload and boxcar?  Yes.  These are the expected means for delivery of commodities to the warehouse.  But the warehouse contractor may also propose and utilize other means as appropriate (barge, etc).

13.	Will there be any less-than-full-carload shipments?   It is possible that some trailers or rail boxcars will be less than full loads on delivery and re-delivery.

14.	Will there be any small parcel shipments?  No, the government does not anticipate any small parcel shipments.

15.	Will the warehouse contractor be required to prepare any special labeling because of the final destination? i.e., foreign countries?  No.  Re-delivery of commodities from the warehouse will be for domestic delivery only.  Normal documentation and labeling for domestic delivery will be required.

16.	Is there a standard label that you require the warehouse contractor to prepare?  Commodity packages (bags and cartons) will be labeled by the commodity suppliers before the commodities arrive at the warehouse facility.

17.	Is there a Radio Frequency ID system required for your commodities?  There will be no requirement for Radio Frequency Identification of commodities.

18.	Billing Rate per metric ton:  Is billing to be done on net product weight or on total weight received which would include the pallet and other tare weight?  Billing will be on a net weight basis, which will not include tare weight.

19.	What does “F.o.b. Origin” and “F.a.s. vessel, port of shipment” re-delivery mean?  Please refer to the definitions in the Federal Acquisition Regulations at Part 52, clause numbers 52.247-29 and 52.247-36.  These clauses may be reviewed on the world-wide web at www.arnet.gov.

20.	Does the warehouse facility have to be able to hold 30,000 metric tons of commodities?  Yes, the government expects that up to 30,000 metric tons of commodities may be placed in storage at any one time.  The warehouse contractor should have available or should have access to enough space to accommodate up to 30,000 metric tons of packaged food.

21.	If the warehouse is at a port please define F.o.b. Origin.  Please refer to the definitions in the Federal Acquisition Regulations at Part 52, clause numbers 52.247-29 and 52.247-36.  These clauses may be reviewed on the world-wide web at www.arnet.gov.   If the warehouse is at a port the F.o.b. Origin clause requires the warehouse contractor to deliver the commodities to, and place them on, the carrier’s wharf at shipside, within reach of the ship’s loading tackle, or to the carrier’s freight station.

22.	In a bid from a port facility, is a rate required for F.a.s. delivery to other terminals/ports?  Yes, a F.a.s. Vessel, Port of Shipment rate is required.  The government may request the warehouse contractor to transport commodities to a port and place the commodities in a F.a.s. Vessel, Port of Shipment position.

23.	Is a port warehouse required to submit rates for taking delivery at the local rail terminal (bridge) or at the warehouse rail unloading platform and place the cargo on the warehouse floor?  Yes.  The government presumes that the port facility has terminals for rail and truck delivery of commodities at the port.  Commodity vendors will be responsible for delivering commodities on a F.o.b. Destination basis.  The definition for this may be found in the FAR at clause 52.247-34.  The cost to take possession of commodities on the unloading dock or warehouse door and place the commodities on the warehouse floor should be stated in your proposal.

24.	What is meant by "First - In, First - Out" (FIFO)?  Will contractor be responsible for moving the oldest commodity out first (example:  If USAID releases 1,000 tons of peas and 3,000 tons are in inventory, is it contractor's responsibility to release oldest 1,000 tons)?  Indeed, in all cases, the government will require inventory to be re-delivered on a FIFO basis.

25.	Will the facility awarded the warehouse contract have an exclusive contract for all warehouse services, or can several facilities share in the contract responsibilities?  The government will consider joint ventures for the performance of this contract.

26.	How do I calculate the price or rate for F.a.s. delivery of commodities to a port?  You add together the direct and indirect costs, plus any profit, for delivering commodities from your warehouse floor to an F.a.s. Vessel position at the ports or coastal ranges to which you wish to offer service.
