QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: N/A
EXPORT CONTROLLED:  NO
QUALIFIED SOURCE(S): United Technologies Corp./Pratt & Whitney (CAGES 52661 / 77445) In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical, and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer, Stephen Smiley 405-734-8114, Stephen.smiley@tinker.af.mil.

Projects may be technology development or development of spacecraft or payloads for suborbital, balloon or orbital space flights. NASA intends to enter into cooperative agreements with institutions for selected projects. The Smallsat Technology Partnerships is a pilot initiative to: 	Develop new technologies and capabilities for small spacecraft by engaging the unique talents and fresh perspectives of the university community 	Share NASA experience and expertise in relevant university projects 	Increase support to university student efforts in small spacecraft technology through funding and collaboration with NASA, to foster a new generation of innovators for NASA and the nation, and 	Engage NASA personnel across the agency in the rapid, agile, and cost-conscious small spacecraft development approaches that have evolved in the university community. The goals of this notice include collaboration with university teams that have experience in small spacecraft development and also extension of support to colleges and universities that have little or no previous involvement in this field.  These dual goals may be met by proposals that involve partnerships between colleges and universities with varying degrees of past experience.  The projects must be relevant to the development or demonstration of technologies or new capabilities for small spacecraft in support of NASAs missions in science, exploration, space operations, or aeronautics.  Examples of relevant technologies are: propulsion, power generation and storage, guidance, navigation and control, communications, thermal management, radiation tolerance, structures and mechanisms, and flight software development.	 Examples of relevant capabilities include: orbital maneuvering, formation flying, proximity operations, rendezvous, grappling, docking, in-situ and remote sensing, precision pointing, atmospheric entry, planetary landing, and mission operations and tracking.  Projects may be laboratory technology development or they may be development of spacecraft or payloads for potential suborbital, balloon or orbital space flights.  The following are not within the scope of this notice: science investigations, operational science missions, conceptual design projects, or mission studies. Appropriate technologies for development must be at a starting Technology Readiness Level of at least 3 (analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept) and no more than 6 (system/sub-system model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).	 Appropriate technologies for development of spacecraft or payloads must be at a TRL of at least 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment). The maximum value of any single award under each Cooperative Agreement will be $100,000 per year, per university or a maximum of $150,000 per year for projects with more than one university partner.  A NASA civil servant labor allocation of up to 1.0 full-time equivalent (FTE) would be available to support NASA involvement in each selected project. Project duration will be one year, with possible continuation for a second year based on satisfactory progress and available funding.  Proposers will be requested to submit a Notice of Intent to propose on or around May 1, 2013.  Proposals will be due on or around June 5, 2013.   Proposals shall be submitted electronically, and all proposers shall use NASAs proposal data system, NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com     ) or Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov	  ). In addition, the electronic proposals must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Participation is open to US colleges and universities. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this CAN must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal.

<RESPDATE>042313
<CONTACT>Irina Perl, Contract Specialist, Phone 4107862240, Email irina.perl@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the management and implementation of multiple physician quality programs including the Physician Quality Reporting System, Electronic Prescribing (eRx) Incentive Program, and other programs that rely on and/or leverage quality data collected under these programs or the reporting infrastructure of these programs.
<p>CMS builds its measure development and maintenance work on the National Quality Strategy's (NQS) three aims of better quality of care, better health, and lower costs, and the following six priorities: clinical quality of care, care coordination, population/community health, safety, person- and caregiver-centered experience and outcomes, efficiency and cost reduction. These focus areas shall drive measure development, selection, and maintenance.</p>
<p>CMS intends to obtain support services for the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) to include maintenance and support of the measures, analytic services (including but not limited to trending performance rates etc.) and implementation support. This includes all measures within PQRS, eleven (11) CMS-owned measures and non-CMS owned measures used for reporting and performance for the PQRS Program and other quality reporting programs to include but not limited to Accountable Care Organizations (ACO), Meaningful Use (MU), or Value Based Modifier (VBM). This also includes maintaining and supporting up to six (6) additional measures (that do not have current steward ownership) if the COR requests that those additional measures be included for the PQRS program.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Contractor will conduct business through partnerships within CMS, across other Federal and state agencies and non-government entities to promote health information technology.</p>
<p>As part of the harmonization process within CMS, the Contractor shall be familiar with the Lean Single Piece Flow (SPF) system in conjunction with scrum/agile when retooling and updating measures. Single Piece Flow refers to the Lean concept of moving one work piece (a measure or small group of measures) at a time through the development cycle rather than process an entire batch of measures before moving it to the next operation. Scrum/agile refers to a Lean methodology that is an iterative and incremental development framework for managing software projects and product or application development.</p>
<p>This procurement is a competitive 8(a) set-aside, under NAICS code 541614 (Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) with a size standard of $14 million. The SBA has assigned number 0373/13/302189/01 for tracking purposes of this contract requirement.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that CMS will award a one (1) year cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with four (4) option years.</p>
<p>This synopsis is in reference to RFP-CMS-PQMM-2013-0001. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). The solicitation package will be available on or 15 calendar days after this notice and the due date of receipt of proposals are 30 days from the RFP issue date. The solicitation will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. Contract awards are anticipated by September 30, 2013. It will be the Offeror's responsibility to frequently check the FedbizOpps site where the solicitation is to be posted for any amendments, changes to the RFP issue and closing date. Questions related to this synopsis should be referred to Irina Perl at Irina.Perl@cms.hhs.gov.</p>
<p>Contractors must be free of conflicts of interest or prepare an OCI mitigation plan to address any actual, potential or apparent organizational conflicts of interest that could arise.</p>
<p>All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (via e-mail). Telephone questions will not be accepted. The Government is not obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice. Hard copies or CD ROMs will not be available. Telephone and fax requests will not be honored.</p>
<p>Source selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a cost plus fixed-fee contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>

Additionally, four other program initiatives that intersect with PQRS and directly impact physicians include the physician value-based payment modifier under the physician fee schedule, Medicare shared savings program, Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive program, and the physician compare website.
<p>CMS intends to obtain support services for the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) to include overall program management, development and implementation of a strategic plan, support on policy decision documents, clinical and other analysis of program data, development of tools and educational materials and products for use by program stakeholders, reporting requirements, and data collections methods. Additionally, the Contractor for this effort will support the Quality Measurement and Health Assessment Group (QMHAG), specifically the Division of Ambulatory Care (DAC), to carry out tasks related to the management and implementation of multiple physician quality programs.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters has released a solicitation, entitled Space Technology Research Opportunities - Early Stage Innovations (STRO-ESI), on April 2, 2013. The solicitation is available by opening the NSPIRES homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/, selecting "Solicitations," then selecting "Open Solicitations," and, finally, selecting "Space Technology Research Opportunities - Early Stage Innovations (STRO-ESI)." NASAs Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) solicits proposals from accredited U.S. universities for innovative, early-stage space technology research of high priority to NASAs Mission Directorates. Eligibility requirements are detailed in the solicitation.  STRO-ESI is focused on low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) space technologies. The goal of this low-TRL technology endeavor is to accelerate the development of groundbreaking, high-risk/high-payoff space technologies, not necessarily directed at a specific mission, to support the future space science and exploration needs of NASA, other government agencies, and the commercial space sector.  Such efforts complement the other NASA Mission Directorates focused technology activities which typically begin at TRL 3 or higher. The TRL of the efforts to be funded as a result of this call will be TRL 1 or TRL 2 at the beginning of the selected effort and TRL 2 or TRL 3 at the end of the effort.  This solicitation seeks unique, disruptive, or transformational space technologies that have the potential to lead to dramatic improvements at the system level - performance, weight, cost, reliability, operational simplicity or other figures of merit associated with space flight hardware or missions. Although progress under an award may be incremental, the projected impact at the system level must be substantial and clearly defined.  This solicitation is not seeking literature searches, survey activities or incremental improvements of an existing technology.  This solicitation exclusively seeks proposals that are responsive to one of the five topics described: Asteroid Detection, Remote Characterization, and Impact Avoidance; Technologies for In Situ Instruments; Optical Coatings and Thin-film Physics; Oxygen Recovery Technology; and Improved Understanding of Cryogenic Propellant Physics. NASA anticipates addressing other areas/topics in future Space Technology Research Opportunities solicitations. All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES or through Grants.gov (www.grants.gov) by an authorized organizational representative. Notices of Intent (not mandatory) are due by April 29, 2013. Proposals are due on or before May 21, 2013. Detailed submission instructions are provided in the solicitation. Potential proposers and their proposing organizations are urged to familiarize themselves with the submission system(s), ensure they are registered in NSPIRES, and submit the required proposal materials well in advance of the deadline. Technical and programmatic comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to the Space Technology Research Grants Program Executive, Claudia Meyer, at hq-stro-esi-call@mail.nasa.gov. Procurement questions may be addressed by e-mail to the procurement point of contact on this solicitation, Jonathon Wingerberg, at hq-stro-esi-call@mail.nasa.gov. Responses to inquiries will be answered by e-mail and may also be included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document located on the NSPIRES page associated with the solicitation; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.

<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis services from Affymetrix, 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051, for a maintenance agreement for a government-owned Affymetrix Fluidic Station.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 the business size standard is $19.0 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>The Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory Unit (MELU) in the Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is dedicated to studying genetic determinants of upper gastrointestinal cancer as part of a global effort to develop strategies for the prevention of these cancers. Efforts in the MELU are focused on gene discovery for genetic susceptibility and early detection marker identification, as well as laboratory analysis in traditional epidemiologic association studies.</p>
<p>The MELU houses a government-owned Affymetrix Fluidic Station (serial numbers 60101670, 60114350, FS0259) which includes a CPU (serial number 57VJPL1), hybridization oven (serial number 11845), autoloader (serial number A06590), and genechip scanner (serial number 54713480). This system is the major analytic platform used in the MELU for the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and expression array chips. The NCI proposes to purchase a service maintenance agreement for this Fluidic Station.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide: 1) One (1) preventive maintenance inspection per year; 2) unlimited emergency repair within forty eight (48) hours of first call; 3) all required replacement parts with the exception of consumable parts to include batteries at no additional cost to the Government; 4) software service and updates in accordance with the manufacturer's latest established service procedures.

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institutes of Health, intends to solicit a contract with the Inova Fairfax Hospital of Fairfax, Virginia to determine the biological mechanisms underlying the risk for the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) onset as well as long-lasting neurological impairments.</p>
<p>In this study the NINR will categorize patients into two groups: 1) trauma patients who do not develop PTSD; and 2) trauma patients who do develop PTSD; to evaluate differences within these groups to determine the biological mechanisms underlying the risk for the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) onset as well as long-lasting neurological impairments.</p>
<p>This study is important to design future care to prevent PTSD onset in those patients at high risk. This study will identify differences in the DNA methylation of stress related genes and concentrations of inflammatory proteins collected in blood and sweat which may contribute to a higher risk for PTSD onset; it will also identify the impact of PTSD onset on perceived health</p>
<p>Data will be obtained from clinical procedures and medical records as part of standard of care to determine the eligibility of the patient. All patients admitted to trauma services are evaluated with the ISS and GCS as part of clinical care. Blood for research purposes will be taken when phlebotomy is done for clinical evaluation and/or treatment or in conjunction with clinical care. The requirement shall include: 1) recruitment of 120 patients total. Recruited patients will be enrolled over year 1, with an average of 10 patients enrolled per month; 2) the study will be completed in year 2, from the date that the contract is awarded and 3) this site will maintain at least 65% of the sample; 3) process samples to analyze epigenetic profiles and concentrations of inflammatory proteins at NIH (4) maintain the confidentiality of the data and to maintain current IRB approval at all study sites; and 5) provide secure back-up of all data essential to the project.</p>
<p>Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition makes competition unfeasible for this solicitation.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. A Sources Sought Notice had been posted as <br />HHSNIHODSBSS13003.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<a href="mailto:jonathan.gray3@navy.mil">NAVSEA eTWD System Solution</a>
<DESC>In accordance with FAR 5.201, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to release solicitation N00024-13-R-4318 in order to conduct a full and open, firm fixed price competition for the acquisition of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software and services to support that software.  The COTS software and services will provide and sustain capabilities of the electronic Technical Work Document (eTWD) System Solution.  The solicitation is projected to be released in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. 

The eTWD System Solution provided by the Contractor will be a transformational change to the way NAVSEA performs depot-level ships maintenance, repair and overhaul by replacing the current resource-intensive, paper-based ship repair work instructions with an electronic technical work document.
  The eTWD System Solution will integrate work instructions, drawings, data tables, digital signatures, and quality assurance forms into an online certifiable document.  It will validate recorded data, auto-populate required forms, and enable online problem identification and resolution.  Upon job completion, certification will be an electronic function within the eTWD System Solution that authenticates proper accomplishment of all work, endorsements, and tests to specified parameters.  The overall goals of the eTWD System Solution initiative are to reduce the resources and time required to author, compile, issue, execute, and certify work while at the same time enabling the non-stop execution of work.

NAVSEA anticipates the Base CLINs in the contract to require the following products and services:

1.Commercial Off-The-Shelf Software and initial Licensing (Development & Testing)
2.Configuration of COTS software for eTWD System Engineering and Management
3.Delivery of Increment One (1), eTWD System and Functionality Capability 
4.Annual Software Maintenance Subscription
5.Technical Consultation      

The eTWD System Solution RFP is a continuation of market research and acquisition planning notices that began in August of 2011 with a Request For Information (Solicitation Number N00104-11-I-QU20) and continued with an Industry Day (Solicitation Number N00024-13-R-4306) in October of 2012 at the Washington Navy Yard.
  Both of the aforementioned Presolicitation Notices have attachments that interested parties may find informational.

The applicable NAICS code is 541511.  The issued solicitation will include a combination of base and option CLINs with a period of performance of 5 years beyond contract award date.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) Philadelphia, intends to enter into negotiations, on a sole source basis, with RODYN Vibration Analysis, Inc., 1932 Arlington Blvd. #223, Charlottesville, VA 22903, to procure two permanent hard-key single user licenses of DyRoBeS software for the Electric Drive Test Facility.

Rodyn Vibration Analysis, Inc., Dynamics of Rotor Bearing Systems (DyRoBeS) software is the only known COTs software that currently meets all Navy requirements. The inclusion of these capabilities in other software packages would require software development which could result in additional cost and unacceptable schedule delays. As a result, the proposed action cannot be processed on the basis of full and open competition since the Government does not possess full legal rights to the essential data in whole or in part.
 

The Government, therefore, intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1.  A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.

The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 541711.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any and all responses must be received within 15 days of this synopsis notice. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s).

<DESC>FOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT: Carlos Diaz at (443) 395-1344 carlos.diazrivera.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> Sources sought for services for the Emergency Power Remote Monitoring System (EPRMS).  The EPRMS provides power status/monitoring to the AN-FPN-67 Fixed Based Precision Approach Radar (FBPAR). The FBPAR provide radar surveillance and air traffic control to military and commercial aircraft. The EPRMS monitor the power status of the FBPAR shelter and site and consistently report the power status of the site backup generator. The power status is then reported to the air traffic control tower (ATCT) through the electronic display screen. The EPRMS indicates in the FBPAR shelter or ATCT whether the FBPAR is operating on normal utility power or the generator is carrying the site load. CECOM LRC intends to award a three year services contract in support of EPRMS.   <br>  <br> The requirement to be contracted is as follows:  When an end user experiences a failure of any of the EPRMS parts listed below, the end user (Army Unit) will then contact the Supplier, and the spare part will be directly issued by the Supplier to the end user.  The Supplier will respond, ship and deliver the replacement part within five calendar days of receiving request from the end user.  The original manufacturers of the listed parts are Allen-Bradley and GE FANUC.  The Government does not possess specifications and-or detailed drawings for the said parts. For components requiring the pre-loading of software and/or configuration, which includes the EPRMS Touch Screen Operator Interface (Allen-Bradley PanelView Plus 700 Terminal - Manufacturer's P/N:  2711P-T7C4B1) and 9300 RADES Ethernet Switch - software and/or configuration information will be provided by the Government to the supplier, and the supplier will load software and/or configure the replacement component as part of the preparation for shipment.  In the case of EPRMS Touch Screen Operator Interface, the supplier as part of the service agreement will copy the EPRMS specific display program to the blank CF Memory Card provided with the replacement Allen-Bradley Bradley PanelView Plus 700 Terminal - Manufacturer's P/N:  2711P-T7C4B1 display (EPRMS Touch Screen Operator Interface), and install the card in the EPRMS Touch Screen Operator Interface as part of preparation for shipping the replacement.  For components requiring specific optioning of dip switches, jumpers or strapping, the Army Air Traffic Control Engineering Team will supply that information to the supplier, and as part of the service agreement the supplier will option replacement components in preparation for shipment accordingly.  The supplier may be required to submit a  report describing the activities performed on a monthly basis. <br>  <br> As part of the response to this market survey, interested Suppliers should provide their proposed method of responding and satisfying the government's aforementioned services requirement. Interested Suppliers may contact the government via writing or electronic mail at the following address: Commander USACECOM ATTN: Carlos Diaz, AMSEL-LCE-IAV, Building 6007, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005. The response must include documentation showing that the Supplier is capable of providing the required services. Responses must be provided by 12 April 2013.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) - Johnson Space Center (JSC) is requesting information from industry regarding potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) arising from the anticipated Integrated Mission Operations Contract II (IMOC II) for services supporting the Mission Operations Directorate (MOD). The nature of the work anticipated under the anticipated IMOC II, where potential offerors will provide mission operations design, development/operability, and plan, train, fly (PTF) services for existing and future spaceflight programs/projects, may create a situation where there could be the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest.  Each potential offeror should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASAs anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the anticipated IMOC II. NASA anticipates that the effort will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  The current IMOC contract Statement of Work (SOW) is provided on the MOD procurement website for reference at http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/IMOCII/    . OCI assessments should include consideration that NASA determines/leads operational processes, decision making, requirements definition and mission execution. Considering the overall NASA leadership role and the potential IMOC II contract requirements, NASA anticipates that the effort will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  Provide operational assessments to NASA of component and system designs, design requirements, analysis, and models developed for: o Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV)/Space Launch System (SLS) o International Space Station (ISS) o Extravehicular Activities (EVA) o Commercial crew or cargo providers o New technology development Provide support to NASA for design, development, and technical integration operations activities for programs and projects including: o Generic analysis and trade studies o Reference mission development o Operations concepts development o Spacecraft and payload safety compliance o Risk management Provide support to development of NASA PTF processes, standards, products, and training/certification requirements used for spaceflight mission operations planning, training and execution activities for programs and projects Monitor, evaluate and provide feedback to the NASA certifying official, as part of the documented NASA certification process, on student (i.e. crew, flight controllers, instructors, analysts) and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities. Provide support to NASA in the development of user requirements and user verification and acceptance testing for user applications, mission systems, and training systems within their associated facilities that are developed and maintained by Contractors other than the IMOC II Contractor Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements Access to a Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participants proprietary information where said Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the IMOC II Contractor These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated IMOC II contract:  Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the IMOC II Contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government procurement contract Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and advice to NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASAs preparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASAs evaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement Potential impaired objectivity if the IMOC II contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractors Potential offerors are requested to address the following questions: 1. What type of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the anticipated IMOC II? 2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. 3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the anticipated IMOC II that were not identified in this RFI? 4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with IMOC II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the anticipated Integrated Mission Operations Contract II solicitation? NASA intends to assess any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offerors proposed OCI mitigation strategy, responding to each company who submits a mitigation strategy in writing.  NASAs response will simply be an attempt to preliminarily examine possible circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI.  It will not be a confirmation that, in fact, an OCI will ultimately exist or that an offeror can successfully eliminate or mitigate an OCI.  Furthermore, the response in no way alters or interprets the application of FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should a potential offeror elect to submit a proposal in response to a solicitation for the anticipated IMOC II. Subsequent to the initial submission and response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. For your information, a link to the NASA Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest has been posted to the Integrated Mission Operations Contract II procurement website at: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/IMOCII/    . You are requested to provide electronic responses via e-mail to the Contracting Officer listed at the end of this synopsis.  Your response is requested by 4 p.m. CDT on April 23, 2013.	 The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only.	NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the potential offeror who submitted it. Any information submitted in response to this RFI that is marked as Confidential Commercial or Financial Information or with similar restrictive markings will be considered as voluntarily submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. The Government intends to release the names, addresses, and points of contact of all respondents unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent.  This information will be included in the interested parties list on the IMOC II procurement website.  All questions should be directed to the point of contact identified below.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.	The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. The Government will not pay for any information solicited under this RFI.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	  .

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a High Precision Devices (HPD) Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR) system, Model 103 Rainier or an equivalent model that is capable of meeting the salient characteristics of the brand name identified herein.
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.</p>
<p>If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST requires an ADR-type closed cycle cryocooler to operate cryogenic single-photon detectors in support of its photonic-based quantum information efforts to meet its mission. The extraordinary combination of performance characteristics of these cryogenic photon detectors, with their near unity photon detection efficiencies and the capability to resolve the number of incident photons, are required for a number of the efforts in support of our mission.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide a dewar/ adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) system with a dewar/closed-cycle refrigerator/ADR system (henceforth referred to as the "cryostat") as per specifications already determined by NIST Boulder for operation of cryogenic single photon detectors. The cryostat that is being procured must be fully compatible (thermally, electrically, mechanically) with an existing cryostat system. It is anticipated that the cryostat will be used in a number of different applications and with a number of types of cryogenic detectors developed at NIST and already in use in our laboratory. In particular this system will be used with transition edge superconducting sensors, which due to their extreme sensitivity put very specific requirements on the cryostat system. As a consequence, the dimensions and clearance of the cryostat, and thermal and electrical environments it provides for cooling and mechanically isolating the detectors and extracting the wiring outputs of the detectors through the cryostat are tightly constrained.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics of the High Precision Devices (HPD) Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR) system, Model 103 Rainier are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The ADR refrigeration system must have a demonstrated record of being used to cool superconducting transition-edge sensors. <br /><br />2. The unit must be capable of obtaining a base temperature &lt; 100mK and maintaining this temperature in excess of seven (7) days per cooling cycle without a heat load.</p>
<p>3. The unit shall maintain mechanical vibrations at a level that does not interfere with experiments on an optical table.</p>
<p>4. The unit shall be cryogen-free, not requiring liquid nitrogen or liquid helium for operation.</p>
<p>5. The cryocooler must have a cooling power greater than 0.5W at 4.2K to allow for heat sinking many copper wires.</p>
<p>6. A motorized ADR heat switch with controller must be included.</p>
<p>7. The vacuum feedthroughs must be standard KF fittings. There must be at least three KF fittings. At least two must be KF40 or larger. There must be a quick connect clamp for opening the vacuum jacket to allow fast access to the cold stages.</p>
<p>8. There must be a remote motor valve for the cryocooler to reduce EMI from the compressor. Compressor lines from the compressor to the remote valve and from the remote valve to the cryostat must include sound dampening insulation to reduce noise.</p>
<p>9. There must be a stand to hold the ADR that allows for tilt adjustment and vertical height adjustment of more than 25 inches for ease of servicing or placing the cryostat on a table surface.</p>
<p>10. There must be a stage of cooling below 1K for cooling wires that will be connected to electronics at 3K and the detectors at the base temperature.</p>
<p>11. The system must include a thermometry system that monitors and controls the temperature of the stages of the cryocooler, magnet, 1K stage, and base temperature stage. Communications options will include both RS232 and GPIB. All cables and breakout boxes necessary for operation must be included. In addition to a rack mount mainframe for the control system, the following specific modules will be provided to read temperature and control the magnet:</p>
<p>a.&bull; AC Resistance Bridge for RuOx measurements and control signal for the magnet controller.</p>
<p>b. &bull; PID controller uses RuOx input to control a magnet power supply.</p>
<p>c. &bull; Octal multiplexer accepts signals from up to eight RuOx sensors and interfaces with the AC Bridge.</p>
<p>d. &bull; Diode Temperature monitor reads and displays the signals from the silicon diode sensors.</p>
<p>e. &bull; Quad channel digital voltmeter</p>
<p>f. &bull; A bi-polar operational power supply for the ADR magnet.</p>
<p>g. &bull; Wiring Break-out Box provides convenient and customizable interconnects between the cryostat and the components of the control system</p>
<p>12. The readout of the base temperature stage must use a low-noise lock-in amplifier so that minimal excitation current is used to measure the temperature.</p>
<p>13. The system must include a 10 Amp power supply to energize the magnet.</p>
<p>14. The system must include the capability to regulate the temperature of the base temperature stage by controlling the current in the magnet.</p>
<p>15. The temperature of the 1st stage must be &lt;50K.</p>
<p>16. The temperature of the 2nd stage must be &lt;3K with the ADR unit installed.</p>
<p>17. There must be radiation shields at the 1st stage (&lt; 50K) temperature of the cryocooler.</p>
<p>18. There must be a radiation shield at the 2nd stage (&lt; 3K) temperature of the cryocooler.</p>
<p>19. There must be enough penetrations through the 1st radiation shield for wiring so that at least 7 micro-d connectors can be mounted. Each micro-d connector will contain 25 connections. The penetrations needed for the thermometry are not included in this count.</p>
<p>20. There must be enough penetrations through the 2nd radiation shield for wiring so that at least 3 micro-d connectors can be mounted. Each micro-d connector will contain 25 connections. <br /><br />21. There must be an area of at least 5" x 5" on the 2nd stage that is unoccupied and can be used to mount NIST made printed circuit boards for superconducting electronics.</p>
<p>22. There must be a suitable scheme for mounting wiring to the 1K cooling stage.</p>
<p>23. There must be a suitable area for mounting devices to the base temperature stage.</p>
<p>24. The volume of workspace that is enclosed by the 4K radiation shield must be at least 25 cm diameter and 25 cm high and additionally must be large enough so that a 1" x 1" x 4" volume of copper can be mounted to the base temperature stage. In the volume of workspace, suitable room must be there to accommodate 100 twisted pairs of wires and 24 optical fibers.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.</p>
<p>Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (greater than $25M) within the Baltimore District Area.  This area includes lower Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington D.C. Metro area, Northern Virginia (VA) and West Virginia (WV).  Projects may consist of new construction as well as renovation, repairs and upgrade projects.   <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).   <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.  Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law.  Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.  Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> (1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts awarded by the Baltimore District Corps of Engineers area described above?   <br> (2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? <br>  <br> (3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> (4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses? <br>  <br> (5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA? <br>  <br> (6) What is the cost impact to the bid/proposal due to a PLA? <br>  <br> (7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Baltimore District solicitation and any resultant contract? <br>  <br> Responses shall be submitted via email to Mr. Kevin Cook at Kevin.j.Cook@usace.army.mil no later than 1 p.m. (EST) on 17 April 2013.   <br>  <br> This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey. <br>

<DESC>Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for Dredging of New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site Lower Harbor, New Bedford, MA to determine interest, availability and capability of 8(a), HUB Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns.  The NAICS code for the work described below is 237990 with a project cost between $30-$35 million dollars.  Work will begin in March 2014 and will extend over a two year period. <br>    <br> Work consist of providing materials, equipment, and labor for environmental dredging of approximately 300,000 cubic yards (CY) of material and depositing it in the Lower Harbor Confined Aquatic Disposal Cell (LHCC).  Offerors should note that this is not production dredging.  The selected contractor will need to meet precise dredge depths.  Dredging, placement of material into scows, transport of the material, and depositing of material into the LHCC must be performed with minimal spillage or turbidity.  Measures will be required to minimize disturbance of sediments and turbidity.  The LHCC is located between the Route 195 and Route 6 bridges.   The offeror must demonstrate the ability to provide suitable equipment that can dredge at a depth of up to 30 feet of water and shallow draft equipment capable of dredging in 3 feet of water.  The work requires compliance under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 including a Health and Safety Program, Site Specific Health and Safety Plan, and Training (40 Hour HAZWOPER and 8 Hour Refresher Training) for all onsite workers.  The offeror must indicate whether they own, plan to rent or identify their teaming partners who owns the necessary equipment.   <br>  <br> The excavation of the CAD cell will be conducted under a separate contract issued by the New Bedford Harbor Development Commission (HDC).  Sediments placed into the LHCC will be dredged using mechanical dredging equipment.  Debris removal will be required prior to dredging and may include discarded metal objects, timber, abandoned piers.  Access to the upper harbor dredge area is restricted by two low bridges. Shallow draft split hull scows are required to perform this dredging.  All dredged material shall be removed with an environmental (closed) bucket.  Dredging is limited to the upper 2-4 feet.  The dredging process will be operated in a careful, well-designed manner so that the project-specific turbidity criterion of 100 neptholometric turbidity units (ntu) above background measured 300 feet down-current of the dredge area is not exceeded.  The dredged sediments will be placed into split-hull scows for transport to the LHCC. The dredged sediment will not be mechanically dewatered prior to placement, although some passive dewatering will occur during material handling and transport. Free-standing water collected in the scows/hoppers shall be decanted and filtered using activated carbon to ensure compliance with this same 100 ntu turbidity criterion.  A silt curtain and oil boom will be placed around the perimeter of the LHCC. Best management practices, including water and air quality monitoring, will occur during the mechanical dredging, transportation and placement processes to ensure that no excess of project performance standards occur and that the placed sediments stay within the LHCC.    <br>  <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.), bonding capacity, as well as qualifications and experience in performing the work requirements in similar size and value as stated above.  Please include three examples performed in the last 5 years and identify if you performed as a prime or subcontractor.  Subcontractors may be used to demonstrate this past experience.  Provide contract numbers, project location, description of the work requirements, point of contact and phone number for each effort.  Responses are due 23 April 2013 no later than 4:00 PM.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN: R. Muhammad (Contracts Branch). Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.   <br>  <br>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers New England District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:  <br>  <br> Lower Harbor Confined Aquatic Disposal Cell (LHCC), New Bedford, Massachusetts  <br>  <br> Description:   The filling of a confined aquatic disposal (CAD) cell in the New Bedford lower harbor for disposal of approximately 300,000 cy of mechanically dredged sediments with PCB levels above the 50 PPM.  Sediments placed into the Superfund LHCC will be dredged using mechanical dredging equipment similar to that used for the navigational dredging to date. The dredged sediments will be placed into a scow for transport to the LHCC. The dredged sediment will not be mechanically dewatered prior to placement, although some passive dewatering will occur during material handling and transport. Depending on the type of equipment used, the dredged sediments will be placed into the LHCC by utilizing a split-hull scow. A silt curtain and oil boom will be placed around the perimeter of the LHCC. Best management practices, including water and air quality monitoring, will occur during the mechanical dredging, transportation and placement processes to ensure that no excess of project performance standards occur and that the placed sediments stay within the LHCC. <br>  <br> Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000.00 and $35,000,000.00. <br>  <br> Period of Performance: approximately 720 calendar days after Notice to Proceed.  Notice to Proceed is anticipated to occur between March 2014 and December 2015 <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are: <br>  <br> a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br> b. The complexity of the project. <br> c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br> d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br> e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area. <br> f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br> g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br> h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).  <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br>  <br> 1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br>  <br> 2. Be consistent with law. <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described LHCC? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve?  What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the LHCC project? <br>  <br> b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency?   If so, how?  What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?  What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area?  Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project? <br>  <br> d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles of LHCC) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project?  Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements?  <br>  <br> g. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?  For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc.. <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your responses to these questions and any comments via e-mail to Ms. Raushanah Muhammad, Contract Specialist, at raushanah.m.muhammad@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 23 April 2013. <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division in support of Unmanned Systems and Warfighter Technology Team (RDNS-TSU) located at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, is requesting concept papers from industry and academia for enabling technologies that support the development of a mobile soldier sensor.  The overall capabilities of the cargo pocket sized (7.5 in x 7.5 in x 1 in = 56.25 in3) soldier sensor should support both indoor and outdoor intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Initially, a white paper proposal will be submitted and reviewed and those that are selected will be invited to submit a formal proposal.  The desired final outcome would be prototype hardware and software that will be used to advance the state of the art in Soldier ISR and integrate with an overall Cargo Pocket ISR system when they reach the requisite Technology Readiness Level (TRL).   <br>  <br> The Unmanned Systems and Warfighter Technology Team is specifically interested in two types of enabling technologies: <br>  <br> (1)	Advanced payloads of the appropriate size (~2 grams) and power consumption for a sensor system that can support imaging at night and during low lighting conditions. <br> (2)	Guidance, navigation, and control systems that can support navigation in indoor environments where GPS is not available along with the capability to operate the platform semi-autonomously (station holding/hovering and waypoint navigation), avoid collisions, and allow the sensor to recover and/or regain aeronautical stability if a collision does indeed occur.    <br>  <br> The proposed research and development approach must clearly identify the proposed personnel, materials, and equipment required to successfully execute.  Approximate cost and schedule should also be provided in the concept paper. Concept development strategies without such supporting information will be weighed negatively.  Interested parties should  submit a white paper proposal for evaluation.  NSRDEC will invite authors of selected white papers to formally propose, which includes the ability to collaborate and discuss specific approaches with the Technical Point of Contact (POC) to optimize successful submission. Following proposal submission, no contact with the Technical POC may occur as the official selection process for contract award will begin.   <br>  <br> All efforts are subject to availability of funds. <br>  <br> All interested firms are encouraged to submit a concept paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Solicitation W911QY-13-R-0032, which can be found at http://www3.natick.army.mil. The BAA contains instructions for submission of Concept Papers against H.1  quote mark Soldier Intelligence Surveillance, and Reconnaissance quote mark .  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. Nothing shall be construed herein or through the synopsis process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this synopsis. Firms responding to this synopsis shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government, and will not be returned to the submitter. Interested parties are invited to submit a concept paper under the topic referenced above and shall submit via email to Mr. Michael Samuel (michael.n.samuel.civ@mail.mil) by 26 April 2013.  The Government shall evaluate all concept papers and provide an invitation to the selected authors on or about 6 May 2013.  Technical questions concerning this acquisition should also be addressed to Mr. Michael Samuel, via e-mail michael.n.samuel.civ@mail.mil or 508-233-4663.  Authors are highly encouraged to speak with the above POC prior to white paper submission. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that cost plus fixed fee contract will be awarded.  In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, for an anticipated cost type contract to be awarded, potential offerors must ensure that they have an adequate accounting system, as determined by their cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office.   The Natick BAA is effective from April 1, 2013 through March 30, 2015. This synopsis 26 April 2013. <br>

<a href="mailto:josephine.e.baran@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Baltimore</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis per FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with Ohio University, Athens, Ohio, for the acquisition of diamondback terrapin monitoring during the nesting season out on the Poplar Island Ecosystem Restoration Project in Talbot County, Maryland.  Dr. Willem Roosenburg with Ohio University is uniquely qualified to support the needs of Poplar Island and the terrapin monitoring efforts.   Dr. Roosenburg has conducted research on diamondback terrapins in Maryland since 1987. The cornerstone of his research program is long-term mark-recapture studies with the goal of monitoring population response to changes in the environment, including climatic factors, habitat use and availability, and anthropomorphic perturbations. This work has resulted in numerous peer-reviewed publications, presentations at national and international meetings and an international reputation as a population biologist and a terrapin expert. During his career, he has served on the Governor's Task Force for Diamondback Terrapin Conservation and Management. He currently serves on the IUCN/SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group that make recommendations and proposals concerning the protection of rare, threatened and endangered turtles. He wrote the species account for the compendium Conservation Biology of Freshwater Turtles by invitation of the specialist group. Additionally, Dr. Roosenburg is the mid-Atlantic regional representative of the National Diamondback Terrapin Working Group, a national group of scientist that provides recommendations for terrapin research, conservation, and management. Dr. Roosenburg presented his terrapin research at a symposium on temperature dependent sex-determination at the Fifth World Congress of Herpetology in South Africa in 2005. Finally he has been monitoring the Poplar Island Terrapins since 2002 when they were first discovered nesting on the Island and he maintains the only database on the terrapins there. In addition, he maintains the largest database of terrapins in the Bay. The determination to not compete the proposed acquisition is within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by close of business (5:00 PM EST) Friday, April 12, 2013 will be considered by the Government. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>The offer must submit a quotation providing information and data that shows the proposed item meets the specifications described above and that the offeror is willing to submit a sample item to be tested on 6 or 7 May 2013. Simply reiterating that the proposed item meets or exceeds the specifications is not acceptable. On a separate paper from the technical information, the quote must contain the price, a statement that the price will remain valid for 90 days after the date of the quote, and the amount of time needed for delivery of the required item. The quote must also include the quoting company's name, address, CAGE Code, Point-of-Contact's name, phone, and email address, Quotation Number and Date.</p>
<p>Technical Ability will be determined as follows:</p>
<p>Step A: The Government will initially evaluate the written quote to determine if the proposed item appears to meet the required specifications. If the quoted item does not meet the specifications, the quote will be determined to be technically unacceptable. If the evaluation determines the item appears to meet the required specifications, the contractor will be notified and required to provide a sample item to be tested on 6 or 7 May 2013. If the contractor can't submit a sample item to be tested on either of those dates, the quote will be determined to be non-responsive.</p>
<p>Step B: The items that appear to meet the required specifications based on the written quotations will be tested to ensure they meet the required specifications and be given a score. The score is the total time it takes to complete all of the steps in Attachment 1 (FA8601-13-T-0130 Ultra-High Resolution Optical Spectrum Analyzer Step B Test Process).<br /><br />The minimum number of people to be present at the testing of the item will be the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist, the Government Program Manager, and the Contractor's Representative(s) (no more than two). At any time during the testing of the item it is discovered that the item fails to accomplish the specific tasks identified in Tables 1, 2, and 3, the testing will be stopped and the Contracting Officer will find the quote technically unacceptable. The item will be returned to the contractor at the conclusion of the testing. The same Government samples will be used to test each contractor's submitted sample item.</p>
<p>If the testing of the sample item confirms the item meets all of the required specifications and accomplishes the specified tests in Tables 1, 2, and 3, it will be considered technically acceptable and given a score for Technical Ability. The score for Technical Ability is the total amount of time for the item to accomplish all of the tests identified in Tables 1, 2, and 3. (A lower score is considered better Technical Ability i.e., when comparing two or more scores for Technical ability, the Contractor with the lowest score would be considered to have the best Technical Ability.)</p>
<p>The Government will make an award from this RFQ to the responsible offeror whose quote will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The factors that shall be used to evaluate the quotes are Technical Ability and Price, with Technical Ability more important than price.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to not make an award at all. By submission of a quotation, the offeror acknowledges the requirements that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management Registration (SAM) prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. Point-of-Contact is Jan Holbrook (937) 522-4609. Offers can be emailed to jan.holbrook@wpafb.af.mil or to Alternate Regina Robinson at regina.robinson@wpafb.af.mil. All offers are due by 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Time,&nbsp;2 May 2013.</p>

<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>

<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Technical Capability: Meets all requirements stated in the Bill of Materials (BOM).<br />(2) Price: No additional information from the offeror will be required if the price is based on adequate price competition. In the event adequate price competition does not exist, the contracting officer will obtain other than cost and pricing data from the offeror to the extent required to determine the reasonableness of the offered prices.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br />52.233-1 DISPUTES. (JUL 2002)</p>
<p>(a) This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613).</p>
<p>(b) Except as provided in the Act, all disputes arising under or relating to this contract shall be resolved under this clause.</p>
<p>(c) "Claim," as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under the Act until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under the Act. The submission may be converted to a claim under the Act, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.</p>
<p>(ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.</p>
<p>(iii) The certification shall state as follows: "I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor."</p>
<p>(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.</p>
<p>(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.</p>
<p>(f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.</p>
<p>(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the offer.</p>
<p>(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.</p>
<p>(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>WAWF</p>
<p>EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of, stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:<br />1-866-618-5988<br />COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095<br />CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL <br />Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com. <br />(e) Questions concerning payments:<br />(1) DFAS Indianapolis at 1-888-332-7366. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number ready when calling about payments.<br />(2) Payment and receipt information can be accessed at the DFAS website https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil/.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and paragraph (a) is completed as follows: The following evaluation factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(vii) Evaluation Factors<br />The Evaluation factors are Technical Capability, Past Performance and Price<br />- Technical Capability: Vendor shall demonstrate capability to support the services identified in the attached Statement of Work and Schedule. Vendor must be a Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) approved carrier with an active Military Bus Agreement. Proposals submitted by vendors that do not have an active Military Bus Agreement will not be considered for award. <br />- Past Performance: The Government will evaluate Past Performance in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b) (3). Offerors should identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors are encouraged to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the corrective actions take to address the problems. The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), when evaluating the past performance.<br />- Price: The Government will evaluate Price for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a) Basis for award.</p>

This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

Badges must include contractor?s company name and employee?s name. The badges shall be colored white with black lettering and a minimum badge size of 1.5 inches wide by 3 inches long. A company logo may be placed on the badge, at the company?s discretion. No other items may be placed on the badge. b) Contractor workspace (office, laboratory, desk) shall contain a sign signifying the space is occupied by ?contractor employee(s)  to ensure that Federal employees and the public know that they are not Federal employees.

(c) Contractor employees shall initially identify themselves by name and company affiliation when answering the telephone, presenting briefings, conducting or attending meetings/seminars.

It is therefore in the best interest of the Government to afford the parties a full and complete understanding of their respective obligations. (b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not: (1) be placed in a position where they are appointed or employed by a Federal Officer, or are under the supervision, direction, or evaluation of a Federal Officer, Military or Civilian.

(5) be used in administration or supervision of military procurement activities. (c) Employee Relationship: (1) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the contractor or his employees to exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the Government, but rather the contractor?s employees will act and exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the contractor. (2) Rules, regulations, directions, and requirements which are issued by command authorities under their responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the installation, or who travel on Government transportation. This stipulation is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control which is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract. <BR> <BR>U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground is located in a remote area. The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites. <BR> <BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract.

The Contractor shall also list the date(s) foreign nationals will be on post. If a sensitive test or visit is scheduled during the dates provided, the Counterintelligence Office will inform the Contractor whether the work/visit may take place. Employees will not be allowed on Post until verification process is complete. Once verification has been received, the Counterintelligence Office is responsible to provide the Protocol Office the following information for badge preparation: Name, Company and Point-of-Contact. The Contracting Officer or COR will be responsible to pick-up the badges and holders, issue them to the visitor and return them at the end of the visit. <BR> <BR>Questions concerning this buy must be submitted at least 3 days prior to the established closing date to reasonably expect a response from the Government. Those questions not received within the proscribed date may not be considered. <BR> <BR>

Synopsis:

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective January 2, 2013 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 073 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for the Core Business Line (CBL) for Schedule 073, Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>

SOLE SOURCE- The proposed contract action is for the supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, Cameca Science and Metrology Solutions under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).

However, a determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

This requirement is for the purchase of a Maintenance Agreement for the Electron Probe MicroAnalyzer manufactured by Cameca Science and Metrology Solutions. 

This solicitation is being issued pursuant to the procedures at FAR 13.
  Synopsis exception FAR 5.202(a)(13) applies and Solicitation Number N00164-13-T-0140; is hereby issued as an attachment hereto.  All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted FedBizOpps and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Lead or designee, and can be based anywhere in the world, but must be immediately available for frequent and possibly long-term temporary duty assignments to the Syria region.  The incumbent may be required to live in temporary quarters or in a hotel in a neighboring country for indefinite periods until the situation in Syria is stabilized.  The incumbent must be prepared for uncertainty in regards to the length of time that will be required to remain in the Syria region.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Syria country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>The OTI Syria program will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government to promote stability and democracy in Syria by providing assistance to support the political transition. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  The Country Representative will:</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>This RFQ has one line item described as follows:</p>
<p>Ultrahigh Resolution Optical Spectrum Analyzer (one each) that meets the following specifications:</p>
<p>1) Operational wavelength range: 1520 - 1610 nm<br />2) Wavelength accuracy: +5 pm<br />3) Spectral resolution (FWHM): &lt;10 MHz<br />4) Dynamic range @+200MHz (+1.6pm at 1550 nm): 40 dBc<br />5) Power level measurement range: -70 to +10 dBm<br />6) Power level measurement accuracy: &lt;0.5 dB<br />7) Acquisition time (2000 points over 3 nm range): &lt;1 sec<br />8) Optical Input: FC/PC or FC/APC<br />9) Simultaneous measurements of both primary polarization states<br />10) External tunable laser access<br />11) Automatic calibration<br />12) User interface software features</p>
<p>The offer must submit a quotation providing information and data that shows the proposed item meets the specifications described above and that the offeror is willing to submit a sample item to be tested on 6 or 7 May 2013. Simply reiterating that the proposed item meets or exceeds the specifications is not acceptable. On a separate paper from the technical information, the quote must contain the price, a statement that the price will remain valid for 90 days after the date of the quote, and the amount of time needed for delivery of the required item. The quote must also include the quoting company's name, address, CAGE Code, Point-of-Contact's name, phone, and email address, Quotation Number and Date.</p>
<p>Technical Ability will be determined as follows:</p>
<p>Step A: The Government will initially evaluate the written quote to determine if the proposed item appears to meet the required specifications. If the quoted item does not meet the specifications, the quote will be determined to be technically unacceptable. If the evaluation determines the item appears to meet the required specifications, the contractor will be notified and required to provide a sample item to be tested on&nbsp;9 or&nbsp;10 May 2013. If the contractor can't submit a sample item to be tested on either of those dates, the quote will be determined to be non-responsive.</p>
<p>Step B: The items that appear to meet the required specifications based on the written quotations will be tested to ensure they meet the required specifications and be given a score. The score is the total time it takes to complete all of the steps in Attachment 1 (FA8601-13-T-0130 Ultra-High Resolution Optical Spectrum Analyzer Step B Test Process).<br /><br />The minimum number of people to be present at the testing of the item will be the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist, the Government Program Manager, and the Contractor's Representative(s) (no more than two). At any time during the testing of the item it is discovered that the item fails to accomplish the specific tasks identified in Tables 1, 2, and 3, the testing will be stopped and the Contracting Officer will find the quote technically unacceptable. The item will be returned to the contractor at the conclusion of the testing. The same Government samples will be used to test each contractor's submitted sample item.</p>
<p>If the testing of the sample item confirms the item meets all of the required specifications and accomplishes the specified tests in Tables 1, 2, and 3, it will be considered technically acceptable and given a score for Technical Ability. The score for Technical Ability is the total amount of time for the item to accomplish all of the tests identified in Tables 1, 2, and 3. (A lower score is considered better Technical Ability i.e., when comparing two or more scores for Technical ability, the Contractor with the lowest score would be considered to have the best Technical Ability.)</p>

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide technical clarification to offerors on solicitation N68335-13-R-0065 as follows:<br /><br />Question: Will the Navy accept only the SULLAIR compressor, or is&nbsp;an alternate compressor acceptable?<br /><br />Answer: As a result of discussions with the technical subject matter expert, an alternate compressor cannot be accepted. Last year, the Navy procured two (2) of these same SULLAIR compressors for the A/M32U-21 Maintenance Trailer Pilot Production (First Article) units. The A/M32U-21 Maintenance Trailer's design and testing are based on the SULLAIR specifications, and the provisioning process (including such tasks as spares support, technical manual, training, etc.) was initiated last year based on the SULLAIR compressors. Due to duplication of cost, there cannot be&nbsp;two (2) different compressors in the fleet to support the A/M32U-21 Maintenance Trailer. The Navy will only accept the SULLAIR compressor described in the combined synopsis/solicitation.<br /><br />The combined synopsis/solicitation closing date is not changed.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact: <br />

<p>The Department of Education (hereafter, Department), Institute of Education Sciences (IES), National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), intends to award a contract for a series of studies, based largely on administrative data collections and some student interviews, to comply with the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended.  These studies are designed to describe: (1) how students and their families finance postsecondary education and (2) students' persistence, attainment, and workforce outcomes. They include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (http://nces.ed.gov/npsas);<br />&bull;	Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/b&amp;b); and<br />&bull;	Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/bps).</p>
<p>The requirements under this contract are to:<br />(1)	Develop and implement a plan to field a study of how postsecondary education students finance postsecondary education that is nationally-representative for both graduate and undergraduate students and, for undergraduate students only, state-representative,<br />(2)	Develop and implement a process for collecting data from postsecondary institutions that automates data extractions and reduces burden,<br />(3)	Launch or continue longitudinal postsecondary studies begun in this contract or continued from past contracts, and<br />(4)	Provide data and information as necessary to administer the contract, meet the NCES study requirements, and/or the Department's accountability requirements.</p>
<p>The Department anticipates the release of the "2015-16 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS 2016) &amp; Postsecondary Longitudinal Studies" in April 2013.  The Department anticipates the period of performance for the hybrid contract will be a 60-month base period and a 60-month option period.</p>

<DESC>1. What are the power requirements for the facilities in question?  i.e what size power generators/options will be expected.  kW or MW requirement?

We are not restricting the order of magnitude as long as there is Return on Investment.  Typically, this would entail larger MW systems.


2. Are you looking for a combined heat and power system?

We will consider systems that consider heat and power combined (i.e. biomass, WTE).

<DESC>Updates:<br />April 2, 2013 - FBO Announcement updated to show a response date.<br />April 1, 2013 - RFP Package uploaded to FBO.<br /><br />==<br />The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) contemplates awarding one (1) Labor-Hour contract for one base year and four option years. This will be a competitive procurement set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) under NAICS Code 541611 (Size Standard: $14 million). This acquisition is subject to the availability of funds.
<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) requires the professional services of one full-time individual or two part-time individuals who have the appropriate knowledge, skills, and experience to continue the operation of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) Workplace Helpline for a contract period of one year with four optional years. The one full-time individual or two part-time individuals will work a maximum total of 40 hours per week. It is estimated that an average of 8 to 10 inquiries are received per day. The Helpline individuals will normally operate the Helpline Monday through Friday (except for Federal holidays).</p>
<p>In 1986, Presidential Executive Order 12564 required that each Federal Executive branch agency develop and implement programs to address drug abuse in their workplaces with a comprehensive program that would include a written policy, access to employee assistance program services, employee education, supervisor training, and drug testing. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was required to oversee the development of the Federal-wide program and help agencies with implementation efforts. In addition, HHS was required to establish and operate a toll-free telephone service for business and industry that would answer questions about drug abuse in the workplace. The toll-free telephone service, which is the subject of this requirement was initiated in 1987 and has continued uninterrupted since. Under the Reorganization of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration on October 1, 1992, the administrative responsibility for managing this telephone consulting service was transferred to the CSAP/SAMHSA. In light of CSAP's prevention mission, the Workplace Helpline began to consult on alcohol issues and problems as well as drugs of abuse. Additionally, the Workplace Helpline expanded its scope of coverage to include any community-based program whose mission is to reduce or eliminate the problems of alcohol and drugs of abuse in its community workplace.</p>
<p>The Workplace Helpline responds to a critical need on the part of its largest constituent-small businesses. As has been the case since its inception, the Workplace Helpline receives most of its requests for assistance from small business owners (i.e., employee populations of 250 or less) who represent the vast majority of enterprise in the American economy. Small businesses also represents the segment least informed and least involved in addressing workplace alcohol and drug abuse problems. The Workplace Helpline also answers a significant number of calls by individuals inquiring about workplace drug testing and substance abuse prevention and treatment issues regarding prescription drugs, illicit drugs, and alcohol use. The service is available to all 50 States and territories of the United States and has assisted employers from other countries.</p>
<p>The estimated date for issuance of the RFP is March 19, 2013 with proposal responses due April 19, 2013. The solicitation may be obtained in any of three ways: by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1067, Rockville, MD 20857; or FedBizOpps. If you have a continuing interest in the RFP, notify the individuals identified below that you wish copies of amendments to the RFP (if any) sent to you. Requests for copies of the RFP must be made in writing. Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after the twentieth day will reach the requestor before the due date for receipt of responses. Requests shall be forwarded to the attention of Blenda Perez, Procurement Analyst/PCO, Division of Contracts Management, OFR, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, DHHS, 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1067, Rockville MD 20857. Requests may be sent via fax to (240) 276-1510. Electronic mail and telephone requests will not be honored.</p>

This will be a competitive, Invitation for Bids, bid opening. The work includes installation of a new fire suppression system for the building. The contractor will furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to do the work. <br /><br />General Conditions at Thule Air Base: The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October.

Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally.

Average winter temperature is 20 -30 degrees F below zero while average summer temperature is 40-50 degrees F above zero. One annual military cargo sealift departs from Norfolk, Virginia to Thule AB, approximately 1 July. There are two sealifts that go from Copenhagen, Denmark to Thule AB, one in July &amp; one in August. Airlifting any materials or equipment via military aircraft is very expensive and only on an emergency-need basis. The project magnitude is $1 - $5M . The performance period shall be approximately1 year from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). <br /><br />Anticipate the plans and specifications to be posted electronically on or about 01 March 2013 via the Federal Business Opportunity Website at www.fbo.gov, with a bid opening on 01&nbsp;May 2013.

See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD <br> FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br> PRIORITY 03 <br>  <br>  <br> 1. Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 <br>  <br> 2. Description of Action: Urgent procurement of SpineArt posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) L4/5 surgical implants. This action has an unusual and compelling urgency that could be detrimental to the medical health care mission or could result in loss of life. <br>  <br> 3. Description of Products/Services:  This requirement is for surgical implants needed for urgent care of a truama patient, Brooke Army Medical Hospital (BAMC), Fort Sam Houston, TX.   <br>  <br> 4. Authority Cited: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (2) is implemented by FAR 6.302-2(a) (2) Unusual and compelling urgency.  The agency's need is of such an unusual and compelling urgent nature that without the SpineArt orthopedics surgical implants the medical healthcare mission will be compromised unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits quotes. <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 5.202(a) (s), Exceptions, the unusual and compelling requirement will not be advertised. <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106(c) (1), Soliciting competition, price and availability will be obtained telephonically. <br>  <br> 5. Reason for Cited Authority: The above statutory authority is cited because this is a true, urgent request that has been verified by Joann Espitia on 12 March, 2013.  The surgical implants are needed for a trauma patient for 13 March, 2013 and without it would compromise medical care and life threating patient.  <br>  <br> 6.

FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	260 Industrial Way West
     	Eatontown, NJ 07724
      
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm fixed-price delivery order issued under a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV contract for Sencha brand name software, which includes Sencha Ext JavaScript (JS), Sencha Touch, Sencha Touch Charts, Eclipse Plugin for Ext JS, Sencha Architect and 12 months of Premium Support for Ext JS and Sencha Touch.

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is for the procurement of Sencha brand name software licenses, including Sencha Ext JS, Sencha Touch, Sencha Touch Charts, Eclipse Plugin for Ext JS, Sencha Architect and 12 months of Premium Support for Ext JS and Sencha Touch.  The Sencha suite of products and services required is a set of tools that will support creation of tablet-based applications (apps).  The specific tools/products required are as follows:

    a.  Sencha Ext JS:  A web framework of development libraries that enables developers to use a model-view-controller architecture when building apps.  The new Model-View-Controller (MVC) enables apps to leverage features like infinite Scrolling a Grid to build an entirely new level of interactivity into web apps.

    b.  Sencha Touch:  An application framework built specifically to leverage HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript for the highest level of power, flexibility, and optimization.  Product uses HTML5 to deliver components like audio and video, as well as a local Storage proxy for saving data offline.  Product makes extensive use of CSS3 in stylesheets to provide robust styling.

    c.  Sencha Touch Charts:  An application framework that allows the user to create charts and graphs for use in tablet applications.

    d.  Eclipse Plugin for Ext JS:  Allows for rich code completion, error correction, and Eclipse-based team collaboration to facilitate ease in building complex applications in large and distributed team environments.

    e.  Sencha Architect:  An HTML5 visual application builder enabling users to design, develop, and deploy applications from a single, integrated environment.

    f.  Sencha Premium Support: Provides for technical support for 12 months and also provides for free upgrade to the next major version release of the Sencha products.
The total estimated price of the proposed action is $

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is 41 U.S.C. 4106(c) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled, "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."   

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited:  The Sencha product suite of developer tools are already in use in the current Health Management Platform (HMP) Collaborative Development Environment.  HMP provides a collaborative development environment for multiple development partners and pilot sites. The HMP prototype has a universal user interface for the electronic health record and includes data connectors to link the HMP platform securely to patient data from any source to include Department of Defense (DoD) systems.  Sencha gives VA developers the ability to prototype applications and provides a powerful code editor that improves productivity and allows the developers to work in lock-step to create applications with other partners.  Switching to another vendor's product, even if one with similar capabilities could be located, would result in development delays that would negatively impact the quality of software provided or could even threaten the continuity of operations.  In addition, fundamental changes to the development environment could also impact HMP's ability to collaborate with downstream DoD systems to facilitate data sharing across the VA and DoD healthcare information systems.  If another robust developer tool could be identified, selecting another brand of software would lead to additional expenses.  For example, 3-6 developers working 60-90 days at approximately $116 dollars an hour to decommission and standup and new system would cost approximately $111,000 to $335,000 with training costs and result in a delayed system.  These costs could not be recovered through subsequent competition.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(6), this effort is exempt from pre-award synopsis since the proposed contract action is an order placed under an existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government's technical experts will continue to perform market research to determine if there are any suites of products available that will enable future requirements to be competed.  

8.  Market Research: VA's technical experts conducted market research in March 2013 by researching similar products for the Sencha product requirements.  The products researched were Adobe Flex and Highcharts.  The Adobe Flex and Highchart websites were reviewed to determine if available functionality was equal to the Sencha products.  Adobe Flex does not support mobile or tablet application development and Highcharts only does charting.  Research determined both products have security shortfalls for operation within the VA enterprise and would not provide the full capabilities that the Sencha brand provides.

Further market research was conducted via the NASA SEWP IV Product Verification and Manufacturer Lookup tool indicated that the required Sencha software is available only from one Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Value Added Reseller (VAR) in Group B and one Small Business VAR in Group C on the NASA SEWP IV contract vehicle.

9.  Other Facts: None.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR
OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, West Palm Beach Medical Center, 7305 N Military Trail, West Palm Beach Fl.

2.	In order for the Medical Center to comply with the new government-issued energy regulations, changes need to be made to the existing building infrastructure. To accomplish this, a new building automation system is needed since the existing system is obsolete. 

3.	Contractor will provide all necessary labor, materials, tools, equipment and supervision to remove 54 old control panels and rewire and reprogram existing into newly installed Siemens PXCM panels.  

4.	 In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, this requirement is being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) - only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency.

5.	Although other contractors may perform a portion of the rewiring work, the reprogramming requires using Siemens proprietary data.

6.	On January 22, 2013 the VA issued a Notice of Intent to sole-source this procurement on Fed Biz Ops (FBO).  Only one vendor expressed interest by providing his capability statement as was required by the FBO posting.

7.	The Contracting Officer performed price analysis on Siemens' proposal and compared the price with that of the Government Estimate and published General Supply Schedule (GSA) Pricing.  The Government Estimate was based on past current industry standards.  The analysis performed resulted in a determination of Siemens' price as being fair and reasonable for this project.

8.	As described in No. 6 above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.

9.	The rewiring and reprogramming of the PXCM panels is being procured from Siemens in order to bring the current obsolete system up to date to achieve compliance with new government-issued energy regulations.

 
 
10.	This is a one-time rewiring and reprogramming of the system and once completed, the system will allow the VA to competitively compete all further building control systems expansions.

11.	 I certify that the requirement outlined in this Justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.



Debra Becht
Contracting Officer
April 2, 2013

 
12.	 Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is estimated at $99,421.10.  On past acquisitions, General Electric has either matched or offered a lower price than that of the government estimate.

The information presented above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.



Debra Becht
Contracting Officer

<DESC>This is a three month extension of Task Order 0013 under Contract W91WAW-07-D-0028.  U.S. research laboratories and engineering centers are developing the advanced technology that will form the heart of the U.S. Army's future fighting force, Future Combat Systems Brigade Combat Team (FCS BCT). Foreign governments and companies that both use and sell military systems will go to great lengths to acquire the advanced technology that dominate future warfare. Identification and protection of those technologies is essential to the U.S. Army's ability to fight and win when those systems are fielded. The Army must have an integrated technology and program protection program with the ability to perform this critical mission with a high degree of confidence of success.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 22, Network Contracting Activity, 4811 Airport Plaza Drive Long Beach CA, 90815. Transaction No.: 664-13-2-921-0245.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  The VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System's Research and Development Department is contemplating the acquisition of laboratory services through means of other than full and open competition as authorized by FAR Part 6.302-3 "Industrial mobilization; engineering, development, or, research capability; or expert services". No other supplies or services will satisfy Government requirements. A new one (1) year firm-fixed price one-time purchase order in the amount of $40,000.00 payable to Soltesz Laboratory Services (the Lab), Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of California at Irvine is contemplated.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Soltesz Laboratory (the Lab) shall perform neuroanatomical characterization of 10-20 neurons, 5-10 in control and 5-10 in epileptic animal brains.

Fixed animal brains shall be shipped to the Lab.  The Lab will process the tissue by first sectioning the vibratome. Next, the lab will perform immunocytochemical stains for biocytin, parvalbumin, somatostatin, mGlur 1 receptor and if necessary other immunocytochemical markers such as VIP, CCK, or Reelin.  Then, sections will be mounted and cover-slipped.  If the staining is ideal individual neurons shall be anatomically reconstructed under Camera Lucida, a device that performs an optical superimposition of the subject being viewed upon a drawing surface which can then be traced. Finally, microscopy digital photographs shall be taken of the reconstruction drawings and incorporated into figures for further analysis and publication. These figures are the deliverables.


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(X)  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	
Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The Soltesz Laboratory service shall be inclusive of skilled research scientists to perform the immunocytochemcial staining and nueroanatomical reconstructions. The Lab shall also provide all primary and secondary antibodies; histological supplies required to stain the tissue; and all other incidental supplies and services.

VA Greater Los Angeles have prepared the fixed the brains for this process.  Several weeks and many man hours are invested in creating the epileptic animals including but not limited to implanting EEG monitors, monitoring the animals for seizures, recording intensity and frequency of seizures to exact specification necessary for the study. When appropriate the epileptic brains are extracted from the animal and shall be supplied to the Lab. 

Soltesz Laboratory is the only lab that has the knowledge and expertise to perform multiple immunocytochemical stains, and identification of single hippocampal interneurons. The technique used by the lab is not exclusive to the lab as it is commercially available; however its application in this case is specific to this particular research. This lab is the international authority in the field of hippocampal interneuron chemical anatomy. The outcome of this Government research relies exclusively upon the unique services of this lab to maintain the board approved research methodology and must be consistent with the research itself. Soltesz Laboratory has pioneered ground breaking research as it pertains to seizures after a head injury; epilepsy; and fever-induced seizures in children.


5.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Market research was conducted as and there are a range of Universities that are experimenting with this field of neurobiology with various focuses. However, are not specifically focusing on seizures and epilepsy. Soltesz Laboratory has published works and result sets in the Journal of Neurocytology; articles in Wiley Press; Science Direct; and is world renowned for its work in the advancement of this field. No other labs are performing this very important work. 

6.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The cost or price of $40,000.00 is considered fair and reasonable. This determination was based on market research as to the necessary supplies and the labor cost associated with this service. This service is a commercial item therefore cost and pricing data is not available. However, based on internet  list pricing  for like cost elements consider the following should cost estimate:

Antibodies (Protein/Peptide): 40 TGF Beta 1 Protein  .005ug @ $509.00 (ug = nanogram)= $20,360.00

7.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was conducted as and there are a range of Universities that are experimenting with this field of neurobiology with various focuses. None however are specifically focusing on seizures and epilepsy. Soltesz Laboratory has published works and result sets in the Journal of Neurocytology; articles in Wiley Press; Science Direct; and is world renowned for its work in the advancement of this field. No other labs are performing this very important work. 

8.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: N/A

9.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above

10.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Research and Development is often pre-approved by various boards at the station or national level. These boards designated the when, why, and how Government funded research studies are to be conducted. R&D rarely allowed to deviate from what the board has approved. This fact provides a barrier to competition both now and in the future.

<DESC><br />1. The Office of Acquisition Management is conducting this acquisition for Kenwood Radios and supporting communication equipment on behalf of DS/IP/SP/MSG-SA.
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The action being undertaken is the procurement of name brand radio equipment for DS/IP/SP/MSG-SA security mission. This will be a new order under GSA Federal Supply Schedule GS-35F-0485T with Kenwood USA Corp via manufacturer representative Federal Communications Consulting.</p>
<p>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs. The U.S. Department of State intends to procure the following supplies:<br />Contract&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Product Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantity<br />GSA&nbsp;&nbsp; TK-5810HBGK2 Range of MHz 50W 100 Zones/512 Channels (R.F. DECK ONLY) 2<br />Open Market&nbsp;&nbsp; S-CLIN-4010B QW-406/MB8P Antenex 7" long / Antenex 17" cable and conn 2<br />GSA&nbsp;&nbsp; 10CHSH KCH-16M, KRK-11M,KCT-22m2,KCT-23M4, KMB-9, KES-5 2<br />GSA&nbsp;&nbsp; KWD-AE20K AES FIPS140-2 &amp; DES Plug-in Secure Cryptographic Module for TK-5210/5310[Intrinsically Safe Approved Accessory] 2<br />GSA&nbsp;&nbsp; KCT-51 HiRose Audio Adapter, can Keyload with KVL-3000+ and HiRose cable 17<br />GSA&nbsp;&nbsp; x-15038 Kevlar Reinforced Two wire surveillance kit with Knowles mic and 6-pin Hirose wired for Motorola Saber 17<br />GSA&nbsp;&nbsp; KNB-43L 3300 mAh, Li-Polymer battery - requires KSC-32/326K charger 30<br />GSA&nbsp;&nbsp; KSC-326K GANG CHARGER (KSC-32 x 6) 3</p>
<p><br />4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. FAR 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(B) Limited Sources - Justification and Approval - Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p>5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. <br /><br />The Kenwood radio supplies being procured under this order use special signaling system enhancements which are required as part of the E&amp;E emergency net to alert personnel in the event of an emergency along with other customized signaling functions specific to the U.S. Department of State, which only the manufacturer can program with this requirement. This requirement cannot be met on the open market by any resellers due to this specialized signaling functionality required to operate with this radio platform already deployed in the field overseas. Marines at post may be required to initiate the alert functions as part of their duties. The signaling system enhancements are proprietary to Kenwood end items and are only produced by Kenwood. To introduce a different vendor radio to existing Kenwood based post may be detrimental to safety since the Marine Security Guard will not be able to initiate nor receive special alert functions in an emergency due to incompatible signaling methods used by different vendors. It also results in more complications due to the: additional training required for familiarity, the inability to use existing spare parts and ancillaries, the additional programming and other maintenance related issues brought on by different vendor software, programming requirements and hardware. The special alert function of "Fleetsync" which is proprietary to Kenwood Corporation. This allows compatible Kenwood radios to send special alerts to other Kenwood radios. Although different vendors make radios that are compatible for voice communications, the radios we seek need to be able to initiate special Fleetsync based alert functions so other users are able to hear those alarms and react. Any changes to the items in the subject acquisition would result in the need to make alterations to the total communication network plan, resulting in additional costs and acceptable interruptions of service and security operations; this equipment is required for continuous, uninterrupted security operations.</p>
<p>6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. FedBizOps notice will be publicized as required by FAR 5.301 and also in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p>7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. In accordance with FAR 8.404(d) Use of Federal Supply Schedules - Pricing. Supplies offered on the schedule are listed at fixed prices...GSA has already determined the prices of supplies under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing.<br /><br />8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted. IRM is constantly evaluating its radio networks and realizes the risk involved in procuring manufacturer specific equipment. However, the equipment for this purchase is specific to embassies and consulates with existing or previously planned Kenwood subscriber radio networks and must be utilized to maintain the integrity, functionality, and safety of communications networks protecting DoS personnel and property, as described in paragraph five (5) of this justification. <br /><br />9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. Communication equipment is highly specialized and what may seem like a "small" change to an item can create unanticipated compatibility issues elsewhere in the system. The specification, as presented, is known to be completely compatible. Any changes would result in additional risk to the government and could delay or prevent successful security operations.</p>
<p>10. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. N/A.</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. In March 2013, the Radio Program Branch will be evaluating different vendor equipment in response to a recent DoS solicitation number SAQMMA12R0137. This solicitation will afford vendors the opportunity to compete for the awarding of a new multi-million dollar contract to support the department's Emergency and Evacuation network radio refresh program.</p>
