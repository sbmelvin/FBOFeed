<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center (PSC), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a 10 month contract plus two 12-month option periods with Digital Support Corporation (DSC).  DSC will assist in the PRISM Web implementation project.  PRISM is a proprietary commercial-off-the-shelf comprehensive procurement application that automates each step of the procurement process and has been in use by DAM since 1993.  It is a very complex acquisition information management package which includes hundreds of users views and tables in the backend of the database necessary for report development.  Currently the PRISM Windows version of the application is being used.  DAM has acquired the PRISM Web version of the product and is in the process of planning an upgrade from PRISM Windows to PRISM Web.  This upgrade must be completed by the end of the 2002 calendar year.  DAM also currently uses InfoMaker to generate reports used to monitor billing and staff workload.  DSC will assist in the implementation and testing of PRISM Web for simplified acquisitions; record and report test results; migrate approximately 43 reports from InfoMaker to Oracle 9iAS and make any necessary changes to the reports as a result of the migration; prepare and manage technical documentation; assist in the assessment of users needs for reporting and design and develop new reports; design reports to allow for easy data manipulation and assist users with the report process; assist in the development of DAM business processes and the implementation and testing of the PRISM Web Large Contracts; design and develop automated reports from existing manual reports; design a PRISM Web Large Contracts Procedures Manual; and perform PRISM System Administrator functions and daily system management and provide user assistance.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  DSC is uniquely qualified for the following reasons:  It is already is familiar with and has a thorough knowledge of DAM business processes, procurement flow, detailed reporting requirements and the DAM PRISM database structure.  DSC has begun assisting DAM with the reporting transformation and Web implementation, has worked in the PRISM application, and is familiar with its numerous views and considerable number of tables.  DSC is familiar with DAM?s current manual reports and business processes used to track the status of various acquisitions and staff workload; track contract milestones and progression to award; track the DAM Agency Fee for Billing report; and provide various management and employee reporting tools.  DSC is versed in the PRISM simplified acquisition procedures and the PRISM large contract reporting requirements and has created customer database views to extract PRISM data.  DSC has identified and reported PRISM database bugs.  DSC has the expertise and knowledge to meet the implementation schedule without delays. Delays in the implementation of PRISM Web will seriously harm DAM and result in the PSC being noncompliant with Federal Reporting Requirements.  Additionally, all reports must be available with no downtime as billing and workload monitoring is critical.  Finally, DAM is allowing the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to use PRISM Web to prepare and electronically submit their acquisition requirements to DAM.  The PSC would be monetarily harmed if SAMHSA could not electronically submit their requirements because of schedule slippages.  DAM intends to begin using the PRISM Web in March 2002.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing their capability to meet the Government?s requirements within 45 days from the date of publication.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the Government?s requirements.  In addition to cost, the Government shall consider the impact to the DAM mission.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source award to DSC.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation package is available for this requirement, therefore, requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses.  See Numbered Note 22.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct competitive procurement. All price quotations shall be submitted to Wanda Russell, Contracting Officer, no later than 12:00 P.M., EST, April 1, 2002.

No telephone requests for this requirement will be honored. Numbered Note 22 applies. Services:   The National Institutes of Health Information and Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center (NITAAC) requires the services of a NON-PROFIT organization that can support information technology investment decision analysis and technical IT assistance. Because of the nature of the follow-on work resulting from award of the NITAAC contracts the use of for-profit, commercial contractors is inappropriate.  NITAAC's requirements are such that performance by a for-profit contractor would exclude them from competing on subsequent efforts for similar work in the same area due to detailed insider knowledge of the project.

NITAAC requires the services of an organization that can, through the business practices it adopts, provide continuing, essential, conflict of interest free services which support information technology investment decision analysis and technical assistance utilizing a general systems engineering and integration approach under their current Government-wide Agency Contracts.  Acquiring this non-profit support will provide NITAAC with unbiased and timely systems and economic analyses, strategic and program planning, and acquisition support.  This action also supports NITAAC in fully meeting the requirements of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, mandating each Federal agency to implement a process for maximizing the value and assessing and managing the risks of agency information technology acquisitions and our Executive Agency Authority granted in 2000 through 2002.  The non-profit contractor shall have unique business characteristics that can provide essential capabilities to conduct explorative studies, independent investment decision analyses, business process reengineering, strategic planning, and IT systems analysis.

DITA operates the NIH Information Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center (NITAAC) and NITAAC currently manages two Task Order Government-Wide Agency Contracts (GWACs): Chief Information Officer - Solutions and Partners-2 Innovation (CIO-SP 2i) and Image World-2 New Dimensions (IW2ND). The Contractor will assist NIH Contracting and Project Officers in reviewing requirements identified by potential clients and proposals returned for same. 

Each of NITAACs two Task Order GWACs has multiple contracts. The Contractor will be required to provide appropriate personnel with the skill sets specified in this Statement of Work.  A labor skill mix needs to be supplied to review the technical functionality and adequacy of clients' task order requests and contractors' proposals, with appropriate attention to task order source selection plans and methodologies for contract award. General analytical studies will also be performed by CTAs in the administration and management of the contracts. In addition, CTAs will assist NIH Contracting and Project Officers in enterprise process improvement, activity reporting, process automation, and acquisition regulation compliance.  The Contractor shall assist the Government in executing NITAAC's strategic plans by identifying required activities and transitioning them into tactical operations that guide NITAAC in the conduct of major systems engineering analysis and acquisition.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in conducting special studies that specifically require a company that has a set of conflict-free business practices and has no proprietary interest in any particular solution. The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in conducting requirements analysis.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in conducting requirements traceability.  The purpose of requirements traceability is to permit the progressive identification of mission needs, operational requirements, and design specification.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in conducting criticality analyses of program requirements.  The results of criticality analyses will be used to prioritize, monitor and evaluate NITAAC's efforts pertaining to development and program phases to derive greatest cost benefits. The Contractor shall perform functional analysis/allocation to the level of depth needed to support required system products and processes design effort. The Contractor shall assist NITAAC to successively (highest to lower level) establish performance requirements for each functional requirements and interface.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in system conceptual design phase to determine feasibility and define product and process solution in terms of design requirements that satisfy the functional architecture and integrate the physical architecture.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in system concept analysis to satisfy operational requirements and program objectives, and to provide a rigorous quantitative basis for performance, functional and design requirement.  The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in system concept planning to satisfy overall program objectives. The Contractor shall assist NITAAC in the development of policy and/or tailoring or selection of specifications and standards for qualitative and quantitative risk management, and in the performance of specific risk management processes. A fixed rate cost reimbursement contract is anticipated.

<DESC>This is notice that WR-ALC anticipates issuing a contract to BAE, Nashua NH for the acquisition of spare parts and repairs for items within the Federal Stock Class 5895 that are determined to be sole source to BAE.  Other sole source items outside of FSC 5895 will be included if considered necessary for weapon system integrity.  A fixed price type contract is contemplated for three years with the inclusion of options to extend the contract to a total of ten years.  An award fee clause based on delivery performance will be included.   

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or  call DLSC at the above number. The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  

Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.


Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kathy Cames, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604.

<SOLNBR>DTFA03-02-R-00012
<RESPDATE>031802
<ARCHDATE>04172002
<CONTACT>Phyliss Schlegel, (609)485-4380
<DESC>Project Title:  Destructive Evaluation and Extended Fatigue Testing of a Retired   Passenger Aircraft <P> Point of Contact:  Phyliss Schlegel (609) 485-4380 <P> Description of Requirement:  Working in conjunction with the Airworthiness Assurance Working Group (AAWG) of the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is endeavoring to promulgate rule changes, which would ensure the absence of widespread fatigue damage (WFD) in commercial transport aircraft.  The pending rules would require an assessment of each aircraft model to prevent WFD.  The FAA will require the implementation of a revised maintenance program to ensure that aircraft are safely modified or retired well in advance of this time.  In the absence of such maintenance program aircraft will not be allowed to operate past their design service goal (DSG). <P> In performing structural evaluations and assessment for continued airworthiness of high-time operational aircraft, comprehensive teardown inspections have been and are conducted in both the commercial and military sectors.  Information and data developed from destructive evaluation and extended fatigue testing have been instrumental in ensuring structural integrity of aircraft, especially those nearing their DSG.  Teardown inspection activities are essential to evaluate airframe structure susceptible to WFD.  Current advisory material to Section 25.571 of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), as revised by amendment 96, suggests post-test teardown inspection as a means of compliance but offers no further guidance.  While the expertise and knowledge base to conduct teardown inspections are well established by the large commercial airframe original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and military sectors, comprehensive guidelines and data that are documented and available to the broa! der aviation community are lacking <P> The destructive testing and analysis of structure removed from retired aircraft can provide the FAA with first hand knowledge of teardown procedures conducted in support of applications for continued airworthiness certification.  Experience and knowledge gained from this destructive analysis will enable the FAA to issue essential rules, policy, and advisory circulars pertaining to the prevention of WFD.  Extended fatigue and residual strength testing of sections of actual fleet aircraft will result in data which will enable calibration and validation of prediction methodologies and can serve as a test bed to evaluate the sensitivity and effectiveness of standard and emerging inspection technologies to detect small cracks. <P> Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, FAA intends to award a single source contract to Delta Air Lines to conduct a destructive evaluation and extended fatigue test of a retired narrow body passenger aircraft in order to develop a knowledge base within the aviation community on the experimental procedures, analytical methods, and data reduction approaches for teardown inspection activities and extended fatigue testing for use in assessing programs to preclude WFD.   <P> The research shall involve the destructive evaluation, inspection, and testing of sections removed from a retired aircraft at or near its DSG.  The sections removed shall be representative of fuselage structure susceptible to WFD identified in the AAWG report entitled Recommendations for Regulatory Action to Prevent Widespread Fatigue Damage in the Commercial Airplane Fleet, revision A, June 29, 1999.  Primary focus will be to characterize the state of multiple site damage (MSD) in fuselage structure using detailed nondestructive inspection (NDI) and destructive examination.  The state of MSD will be advanced through extended fatigue testing using the FAA's Full-Scale Aircraft Structural Test Evaluation and Research (FASTER) facility and then assessed through NDI and destructive evaluation.  The extended fatigue testing will provide data to enable calibration and validation of prediction methodologies and will serve as a test bed to evaluate the sensitivity and effectiveness!  of standard and emerging inspection technologies to detect small cracks. Analysis methods will be developed to correlate the state of MSD at any point in time to preclude WFD.  FAA believes that DAL has the requisite aircraft; essential and specially trained personnel and technological capability necessary to successful complete this research. <P> 3.1.	General Task Listing: Supply Test Article:  The contractor shall supply at least one narrow body transport category aircraft near or at its DSG.   The aircraft must hold up to 120 passengers and be representative of aged revenue-service passenger aircraft with at least 700 currently in service.  The aircraft must have a well-documented and accessible service history.  A prerequisite for the aircraft chosen is that the entire usage in terms of flight types, mix and hours be known.  The aircraft shall have at least 75% of the 16 WFD susceptible structures defined in the AAWG report described previously. <P> Prepare Test Article:  At least nine areas susceptible to WFD, each approximately 8 ft by 12 ft, shall be inspected, removed from the aircraft, shipped, and prepared by the contractor for destructive evaluation and extended fatigue testing.  The contractor shall perform NDI and visual inspection to catalog and fully document the condition of the selected areas.  At least four test articles for proper fit and testing using the FAA's FASTER facility by the contractor.  The contractor shall prepare samples for fracture surface examinations using high-resolution microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). <P> Damage Characterization:  The contractor shall characterize the state-of-damage of all test articles.  This includes quantifying the extent of fatigue cracking, corrosion, faying surface fretting fatigue, and structural disbonding.   The contractor shall split open select fastener holes to reveal the crack surfaces and then perform fractographic examinations to identify, catalog and document crack initiation sites and mechanisms, crack shapes and sizes, and quality of the fastener hole surface.   The crack shape and size should be cataloged and documented.  The contractor shall empirically reconstruct crack growth histories using striation counts. <P> Data Analysis:  The contractor shall analyze the crack data (patterns, distributions, sizes and shapes) and demonstrate how to use this data to characterize MSD crack initiation, crack detection, crack link-up, residual strength and the WFD average behavior in the structures removed using methods recognized by the AAWG.   Analysis methods will be developed to correlate the state of MSD at any point in time. <P> 4.2.	Contractor Qualifications: Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the work, the contractor must possess or have access to a multi-disciplinary engineering staff covering areas of:  ·	solid and structural mechanics,  ·	fracture mechanics,  ·	material sciences,  ·	NDI, and ·	aircraft maintenance and repair.

If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer an Ombudsman has been appointed  to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Ms Kim McDonald, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.  "F" - This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Mission data will be uploaded to the MALD via CMBRE or an aircraft-to-decoy data interface."  e) Add the following:  The Precision Strike SPO has scheduled an Industry Day presentation on Tuesday March 26, 2002  - in building 860 (Enlisted Club, near East Gate), in the Top Three Club Room from 8:00 - 12:00; One-on-One sessions may be scheduled for March 27-28.

The HRB has developed a unique, geographically-based study of women who have had blood samples collected during pregnancies that produced infants with neural tube defects.  The proposed extension will expand on previously conducted biochemical and genetic investigations and continue recruitment.  Extensive biochemical analysis has been performed on study subjects.  Continuity requires that the same laboratory perform biochemical testing for the future work.  This is particularly important in the case of folate assays which have been shown by a CDC study to produce results that vary substantially from laboratory to laboratory. Any organization that has: 1. a geographically-based sample of women who are not using vitamin supplements on whom blood has been collected during pregnancies resulting in neural tube defect offspring, 2. blood samples from subjects with neural tube defects and first degree relatives, 3. genetic data from a genetically homogeneous population relevant to neural tube defects for families with neural tube defect members, and 4. the capability of conducting other genetic investigations and is interested in performing these tasks, should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirements to continue this project.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there are other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work as described.  This is not a request for proposals. Capability statements, not to exceed 20 pages, should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to: Mr. Charles W. Grewe, Contracting Officer, CMB, OAM, NICHD, NIH, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Room 7A07,MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 or via e-mail at cg59b@nih.gov.(See Numbered Note 22).

DESCRIPTION

Introduction:  The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Consular Affairs (CA) intends to solicit proposals from industry to establish one or more ?user-pays?, contractor-provided and operated Visa Information Centers to respond to inquiries by the general public for information on consular matters and to provide certain visa related services as defined in the attached draft Statement of Work.  Initially, the Center(s) will serve callers from the Mission China?s service area, Hong Kong and its vicinity.  Additional service centers may be established later on to serve countries in the East Asia and Pacific region. 

The term ?user-pays? means that the caller will be responsible for paying the Contractor directly for the services rendered, such as, automated information, live operator assistance, fax-on-demand services, etc.  This means no U.S. Government appropriated funds will be made available or utilized in the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall provide the required personnel, facilities, technology, supplies, and services to operate, maintain and manage the Center(s) and to collect the appropriate service fees from the callers to cover all costs incurred to deliver the services requested by the U.S. Government.   The service fees to be paid by the callers will be based on a price schedule approved by the U.S. Government.  Certain portion of the service fees collected by the Contractor will be used to fund Special Related Services (SRS) to enhance the level of service to recipients of consular services and to assist in setting up other center(s) to serve countries in the East Asia and Pacific region.  The Contractor may use different payment methods for collecting the applicable service fees from the callers, including the use of ?900? type ?user-pays? telephone services, credit cards, prepaid telephone calling cards, bank payments, etc.  

Purpose:  To obtain comments from industry regarding industry?s understanding of the requirements as defined in the draft Statement of Work,  implementation strategies and approaches for meeting these requirements within the defined service areas, and payment collection methods for services rendered.  The Department of State intends to use industry?s comments to finalize the Statement of Work for release through pre-solicitation conference or notice.  NO AWARD WILL BE MADE AS A RESULT OF THIS RFI.  NO PAYMENT WILL BE MADE FOR INFORMATION SUBMITTED.

Information Requested from Industry:  Interested parties are encouraged to submit comments on the Draft Statement of Work.  Specific comments are requested on the following questions:  

1. Are ?800? and ?900? type services available in each of the service areas defined in the draft Statement of Work?  If so, are the services accessible from all callers within each of those service areas?  
2. Will it be possible to implement a single ?800? and ?900? number solution to serve callers from Mainland China, Hong Kong and vicinity?  If so, what is the cost impact of such a solution?
3. What effective payment methods and implementation strategies are commonly used for collecting payment for ?user-pays? information services, such as those defined in the draft Statement of Work, including attended and unattended services for voice and fax services, and for responding to e-mail requests for information and support?
What technology is available to enable callers with dial pulse telephones to obtain services via the unattended mode and the incremental costs for implementing such technology over that used for providing unattended services to callers with touch tone telephones?

<SUBJECT>A -- Request For Product Information From Manufacturers of Pedestrian ITS-based Technologies
<DESC>This is not a solicitation notice of intent to procure. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is in the process of evaluating the effectiveness of various pedestrian related Intelligent Transportation System-based traffic control technologies for reducing pedestrian fatalities and injuries as part of its Pedestrian Safety Engineering and ITS-Based Countermeasures Program. The FHWA recently awarded cooperative agreements to three cities in Nevada, Florida, and California to demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive pedestrian safety engineering and Intelligent Transportation System-based countermeasures program for reducing the pedestrian fatalities, injuries, conflicts and other surrogate measures.

The objective of this special announcement is to notify and inform manufacturers of pedestrian ITS-based technologies about the project and obtain from them information on their products. This information should be in the form of brochures, manuals, videos, etc. that can be provided to the metropolitan areas with whom FHWA is working with. Examples of the ITS technologies include pedestrian detectors (infrared, etc.), pedestrian information systems (talking signs, illuminated push buttons, audible signals, count-down signals, etc), motorist information (in-pavement lighting, smart overhead lighting, etc.) and enforcement systems (variable speed limit, speed controls, etc.).
	
The FHWA reserves the right to review the submitted information for relevance to the project.  FHWA is interested in getting five (5) sets of brochures, manuals, and other related materials for each pedestrian ITS-based technology. This information is for general use only, and must not be taken as an endorsement of product or manufacturer. In addition this request for information must no be taken as an intent to procure. Please mail the materials to:

	FHWA,
	400 Seventh ST, SW, HSA-20
	Rm: 3407 
	Washington, DC 20590
	Attn: Mr. Leverson Boodlal

It is requested that these items should be submitted to FHWA by April 16, 2002 and sent by overnight mail.

<OFFADD>Office of Personnel Management, Office of Contracting and Administrative Services, Contracting Division, 1900 E Street, N.W., Room 1342, Washington, DC, 20415-7710
<SUBJECT>D -- Employment Information System (USAJOBS)
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) 1.0 Background The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) operates and maintains the Federal Employment
Information system, USAJOBS. It serves as the United States Government's official source for jobs and employment information.
USAJOBS is available to job seekers through the Internet at www.usajobs.opm.gov. USAJOBS has a companion telephone system
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to ensure access to Federal employment information for all individuals. Studentjobs.gov is also a
component of the USAJOBS system providing one-stop shopping for students. In addition to providing information to jobseekers,
USAJOBS contains a job entry system so employers can enter job vacancies into the system. The OPM Employment Service (ES) program
office in Washington DC administers the Federal Employment Information program, and develops and approves all requirements for
enhancements, modifications, and changes to the system. OPM's Technology Support Center in Macon, Georgia is currently providing all
programming and maintenance support for both the Internet and phone system. The OPM is the managing partner for the E-Gov
Recruitment One-Stop initiative. The Recruitment One Stop seeks to leverage all existing functionality of USAJOBS and to expand
services through providing improved on-line job application submission (one-to-many) for job applicants; integration of paper
resume/job application data; on-line application status tracking; enhanced on-line resume integration with agency systems; on-line
resume mining for agency hiring managers, recruiters, or human resources professionals; on-line employment eligibility determinations;
and integration with a variety of automated assessment options and systems. The Recruitment One Stop will provide job seekers with a
single, Government-wide port of entry for Federal employment consideration. The Recruitment One Stop is a fast track initiative with
implementation of the first enhancements required no later than June 2002. It is unlikely that those enhancements will be implemented
under this agreement. 2.0 Purpose of Solicitation The OPM is considering the award of a cost-sharing contract for the future
development, operations, and maintenance of USAJOBS and Recruitment One-Stop. A cost-sharing contract is a cost-reimbursement
contract in which the contractor receives no fee and is reimbursed only for an agreed-upon portion of its allowable costs. We are
contemplating using this type of contract because of the fact we expect a contractor would realize substantial compensating benefit
resulting from provision of Federal Job Information. In response to the human capital challenges facing the Government in carrying out
the President's management agenda, OPM's is looking to develop a new model for the delivery of employment information and
recruitment services. The challenge to find and keep talented public service workers, given retirement projections, programmatic
reshaping, and a dynamic and shifting labor market, has reinforced "mission fundamentals". Reviving the image of the public service
requires relentless pursuit so Government can enlist the best and brightest, and assure them that their career commitment to citizen
service is valued. Pursuing this new model requires a more nimble approach to the way daily work is accomplished and services get
delivered. We expect to be "on target" for the President's E-Gov initiative in the delivery of on-line recruiting services for citizens. Our
planning strategy calls for increasing use of contractor expertise with our own small staffs serving as project managers. Entering into a
cost-sharing contract for the operation of OPM's employment information systems would allow us to use the technological expertise of
private industry leaders to deliver these services. That expertise permits rapid addition of features to the system, as well as the ability to
take advantage of an established telecommunications infrastructure and disaster recovery platforms. 3.0 Scope of Work Functions within
the scope of this proposed agreement may include the development, operation, and maintenance of all software and hardware systems
(job entry and delivery) for the web sites (Recruitment One Stop, USAJOBS, Studentjobs.gov, and FirstGov jobs page portal) and the
USAJOBS by Phone system. In entering into the arrangement our goal is to gain more consistent and reliable operations; more timely
and effective technical support; quicker systems enhancements and modifications per OPM program office guidance; and enhanced on-line
recruiting services to customers. The OPM will oversee contract performance, interface with agency customers and stakeholders,
provide system vision and direction, explore new ideas/initiatives suggested by the contractor, ensure system integrity and requirements,
determine enhancements/modifications, and make determinations regarding system marketing, recruiting guidance, and related
activities. The OPM will use performance-based service contracting principles to monitor contract performance and ensure the contractor
performs at its best including providing performance objectives, and standards. OPM's employment information systems must achieve a
minimum level of 90% or higher customer satisfaction to maintain and increase the quality of service to citizens and agencies. In order to
do this; we must design improved metrics to measure satisfaction with customer and technical support, and to provide quality control of
systems operation. Reliability is critical-the Federal Employment Information and Recruitment systems must operate 24/7 with backup measures in place in the event of equipment failure or emergencies. The Federal jobs database must be refreshed at least daily if not in
real time. Many system changes, such as updated Employment Information fact sheets, occur frequently and must be implemented
rapidly (24 to 48 hours). More complex changes, such as new job search routines, occur two to three times per year and must often be
implemented within one to two weeks. OPM will require the contractor to retain the unique identity and URL for the USAJOBS web site,
Studentjobs.gov web site, and/or any other web site brands and/or URLs that may develop from the Recruitment One Stop initiative. We
envision that the contractor's identity and branding may be incorporated into the OPM systems. We further envision that the Federal jobs
database and functionality would be incorporated into the contractor's system adding value for the contractor, and increased exposure to
Federal jobs and employment information for job seekers. The OPM is seeking to enter into this contract for an initial term of one-year
with options to extend it for five years or longer. 4.0 General Description of Current Systems 4.1 USAJOBS via Web The USAJOBS system
provides employment and vacancy information to the public and Federal employees. The system has a web-based program that agencies
use to add jobs and vacancy announcements into the Federal jobs database. Many agencies also post jobs using an email template
program that has been integrated into a number of vendor products. USAJOBS offers general employment information fact sheets; link
pages to agency specific sites and information; and uses push technology for email notification of new job postings to registrants. The
system also offers a resume builder service that includes an option for agencies to flag jobs to accept on-line resumes and an OPM process
to transmit resumes to agencies via email. The USAJOBS Federal Jobs Database is also available via FTP. Approximately 16,000 to
18,000 vacancy announcements are available each day. The USAJOBS web site is accessed by over 17,000,000 unique visitors each year
and more than 3,500,000 USAJOBS by Email messages were sent in FY 2001. We anticipate usage to increase at least 10% annually over
the next two to three years. The USAJOBS resume database contains on average 175,000 resumes. Resume transmissions in FY 2001
were slightly in excess of 185,000. A goal of the Recruitment One Stop initiative is to substantially increase on-line resume/application
transmissions and increase the security of the transmissions. USAJOBS does not currently contain features for applicant database
mining, application status tracking, or paper resume/application data integration. USAJOBS via Phone The USAJOBS system provides
employment information via a phone system. It uses the same job database file generated from the job entry system mentioned above.
This system can be accessed at 478/757-3000 or TDD 478/744-2299. As with the web site, this system's hardware, software, and
telecommunications are operational and available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The phone system delivers most of the same
employment information as the web. Job seekers request copies of information from the phone system through a fax/mail request
function. The USAJOBS by Phone system received over 428,000 calls in FY 2001. 4.3 Studentjobs.gov The Studentjobs.gov is a
companion site to USAJOBS that runs off the same hardware/software/database. It's designed specifically to deliver job information to
students while they are still in school. It contains a link to the job search function (USAJOBS), resume builder (USAJOBS), and the
USAJOBS by Email function. It also has some specialty features that consolidate information about Federal agencies. Studentjobs.gov
averages 35,000 unique visitors each month. The Studentjobs.gov web site is a new feature and usage is expected to increase, as the site
becomes better known. 4.4 FirstGov Job Portal page This page is still under review and development but will essentially serve as the
primary link page to all job pages. This feature will also run off the USAJOBS hardware/software applications. 5.0 Technical Description
of Current Systems 5.1 Web Systems All USAJOBS systems are currently housed and supported at OPM's Technology Support Center in
Macon Georgia. Currently, 25 servers support the USAJOBS system-5 HP quad processors, 2GB; 5 HP dual processors, 2 GB; 13 HP dual
processors, 1 GB; and 2 Dell single processors, 64 MB. Of those, 18 are web servers, 2 are database servers, 2 are file servers, 2 are fax
servers, and 1 is a mail server. Development and testing servers are also available (2 - 3) and are not included in the 25 discussed above.
Web server software is IIS; database software is SQL server. Operating system is Windows. Coding language is ASP. The only off-the-shelf
software applications used are Central Dispatch by Resonate for load balancing and Web Trends. It connects to the Internet via a T3
telecommunications line. USAJOBS also provides a link to Online Applications that are part of another OPM system using Oracle. OPM
will make the existing hardware available for our contractor to use in providing the required solution. Our service, however, cannot be
interrupted and the contractor would be required to provide all equipment during the cut over period. 5.2 USAJOBS via Phone The
USAJOBS by Phone system is also housed and supported at OPM's Technology Support Center in Macon Georgia. The current system
was just upgraded to Windows NT/2000 using Realspeak text-to-speech. Conversion of the phone system job searches to SQL server
2000 stored procedures is currently in process. OPM will make the existing hardware available for the contractor to use in providing the
required solution. Our service, however, cannot be interrupted and the contractor would be required to provide all equipment during the
cut over period. 6.0 Upgrades/Enhancements We believe that a cost-sharing contract will allow us to fully realize state-of-the-art
functionality for job seekers and agency employers. USAJOBS and the Recruitment One Stop must be the premiere recruiting tool for
Federal agencies and provide easy-to-use services for all job seekers, applicants, and agency users. All services must provide value-added
enhancements for improving and modernizing the site to attract job seekers; support agencies in their recruiting efforts; improve citizen
service; streamline the hiring process, and promote the Federal government as a viable and competitive employment site in the current
job market. Listed below are some enhancements we believe are salient to this goal; however, we are seeking recommendations on these
and additional features that could be achieved under this contract. Better/easier job search capability Applicant database mining for
employers Integration of paper resume/application data Improved job entry system or processes State-of-the-art reporting system
Applicant tracking function Vacancy announcement enhancements Career exploration module On-line forms Better customer
satisfaction survey and reporting capability On-line/virtual job fairs Recruitment videos Effective banner ads Increased linking capability
FAQ's Site Index Spanish versions of some information 7.0 Accessibility Requirements The USAJOBS system must meet all Section 508
accessibility requirements. Visit www.section508.gov for complete technical descriptions. 8.0 Submission of Information/Comments
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO PAY FOR THIS INFORMATION.
No cost or pricing information is requested. All responses must be in writing and include how the vendor proposes to operate the
recruiting and employment systems under a contract with OPM, how the vendor proposes to enhance the system to meet our goals for
recruiting and citizen service, and corporate experience and capabilities. This information will then be used to define requirements for
the contract. Oral presentations may also be requested to fully understand proposed solutions. The Office of Personnel Management will
use the submissions in response to the request for information to determine if this procurement may be set aside for small business
concerns. The NAICS code for these services, if acquired under Federal contract today, is 541512 Computer Systems Design Services, and
the small business size standard is $18 million. Respondents to this request for information are advised that the plan to use a cost-sharing
contract will require the contractor to divulge cost information within its accounting systems in order for the Government to
determine whether the invoiced costs are allowable, allocable and reasonable for purposes of payment. The contractor must demonstrate
it has an adequate accounting system for this purpose; must open its books for possible audit by the Government to ensure efficient
methods and cost controls are used; and must accept that certain costs are unallowable by regulation (Limitation of Cost clause at FAR
52.232-20 through 23). A formal Request for Proposals may follow. Responses to this request for information should be sure to include answers to the following questions: * What are your expectations and interests in entering into this cost-sharing contract? * What value-added
would be provided to the Federal Government and U.S. citizens through this cost-sharing contract? * What experience in
automated recruitment and hiring do you bring to the table? * What are the specific services you are prepared to offer? * What types of
security are you prepared to provide to protect the system, the data, and data access by users? * How would you protect the privacy of
users? * What would be your plan to guarantee system reliability for 24/7 access? * What would be your plan to guarantee uninterrupted
service delivery in the event that you would cease operations? * What level of support and responsiveness would you be prepared to
provide to OPM for system maintenance and upgrades? * What experience, if any, do you have in entering into such cost-sharing
arrangements? * Describe contract agreements you have that utilize performance-based and or cost-sharing payment provisions,
including describing the basis for the performance-based or cost-sharing payment provisions. * What suggestions do you have for OPM to
consider on how to best structure a performance-based, cost sharing contract? Give the rationale for your suggestions. * List any concerns
your company would have in disclosing information from your accounting systems to determine whether invoiced costs are allowable,
allocable, and reasonable. * Provide your comments on what impact a five-year vs. a ten-year contract term would have on your proposal.
