<DESC>TITLE:  NNA04CI14T, SecTek, Inc.Posting of this requirement to the GPE was previously done on May 8, 2009.  However,after posting, it was noted that the set-aside code stated in the notice was incorrect. This revised posting to the GPE reflects the fact that this procurement will benon-competitively set-aside to large business, corrects the set-aside code from 8aCompetitive to N/A,  incorporates all modifications  and supercedes the postings datedMay 8, 2009.NASA/ARC has a requirement to extend the performance period of the ARC ProtectiveServices Contract for an additional ten months; said extension will consist of one three(3) month performance period and seven (7) one-month option periods, the exercise ofwhich will be determined by the Government on a monthly basis. A modification reflectingthis extension will be issued on or before May 31, 2009, which is the expiration date ofthe current protective services contract. NASA/ARC intends to extend the period of performance of contract NNA04CI14T, which wasawarded as a result of full and open competition under a GSA Schedule to SecTek, Inc., onJune 1, 2004. This extension  is required due to a Protest filed on September 17, 2008,in the United States Court of Federal Claims challenging  NASAs agency-wide contractawarded on May 20, 2008 for protection services (i.e.,security guard services potential fire/fighting/prevention services, and potential emergency medical responseservices) to be provided at NASA/ARC and thirteen different locations located across theUnited States.	Authorization of this extension has been issued by NASA Headquartersunder Procurement Information Circular (PIC) 09-04, which provides a class deviation fromthe requirements of FAR 17.204(e) and NFS 1817.204(e)(iii), which limit the terms ofservice contracts to five (5) years, including the basic contract and all options.  Thisclass deviation applies only to existing contracts containing requirements that willultimately be provided under the  NASA Protective Services Contract (NPSC) when the NSPCprotest is resolved. The NSPC is expected to be available for use in the near future. NASA is using the authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition provided by 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Because SecTek possesses unique expertise in meeting the securityrequirements of the Center, no alternate source could adequately provide for themaintenance of the Centers comprehensive security program during this brief period ofextension.   Award to another source when the agency-wide contract for protectiveservices has been recently awarded, and while the resolution of the protest is nearingcompletion, would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that isnot expected to be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays infulfilling the agency's requirement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon May 15, 2009. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All questions MUST bein writing and should be directed to Ms. Drake not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May15, 2009. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the provision of Allied Command Operations (ACO) strategic airlift and multi-mode transportation services. 

The requirement is to satisfy the ACO airlift transportation requirement via a firm-fixed price contract and to satisfy future transportation requirements via the establishment of a multi-mode transportation Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).

SHAPE is serving as the contracting agency for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. The estimated total cumulative value of the contract is Euro 21.0 million. The reference for this project is IFIB-ACO-SH-09-52. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

SHAPE will award a firm-fixed price contract for ACO airlift transportation to the bidder who will have presented the lowest, technically compliant bid. In addition, SHAPE will establish BOAs with firms whose bids will be deemed technically compliant so as to satisfy any future multi-mode transportation requirements. 

SHAPE will consider firms 1) that have been approved for NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), 2) that have successfully provided a minimum of two years of substantially similar airlift and/or multi-mode transportation services in terms of past performance within the last three years, and 3) that are in possession of the required appropriate and valid aeronautical certifications.

The IFIB package will contain material at the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The Department of Commerce does not serve as the contracting agency for NATO ICB projects. Its role is to approve for participation in NATO ICB those facilities that are located within the United States. Only facilities that have first been approved for participation in NATO ICB may be nominated to the bidders list for a NATO ICB project. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.  The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Deadline for requesting Declaration of Eligibility: 28 May 2009

(Under MBC rules, the contracting agency will continue to accept nominations to the bidders list after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.)

2. Planned Vendor’s Day: Early June 2009

3. Estimated IFIB release date: Early August 2009

SHAPE will directly mail the IFIB to all firms on its bidders list and will post the tender documents on the following website:

http://www.nato.int/shape/community/budfin/ifib/index.htm

4. Estimated bid closing date: Late September 2009

5. Contract effective date: 01 January 2010

6. Period of Performance: One base year (2010) and up to four one-year options

This request is for the purchase of list items here
Generic Nomenclature:  OPMI Vario Surgical Microscope on S-88 Floor stand

Description:  The OPMI Vario provides the surgeon brilliant, homogenous xenon light for surgery.  Apochromatic optics provide exceptionally high contrast and depth perception critical for all clinical and research procedures.

Justification:  The use of the S88 Vario surgical microscope has substantially effected the practice of research surgery by reducing the amount of invasiveness required, all the while giving superior optics for dissection and teaching purposes.  Modern teaching requires direct magnification and illumination far greater than the power of operating loupes or substandard operative microscopes. There are no other microscopes made specifically for procedures as Zeiss OPMI Vario.  The integral features of this system set this surgical microscope apart from any other on the market.  Furthermore, these features, due to extreme delicacy and invasiveness, are absolutely required in any procedure. This operative microscope would incur no additional training costs since the staff is fully trained on Zeiss systems. This equipment would also see full utilization from its time of arrival.  

Specifications required:

The system must provide a stereo view (face to face) for the primary surgeon and assistant or student.

The system must have a high quality video camera for documentation of procedures.

Must have compatibility with our existing Zeiss scopes for ease of use and maximum economy.

Fiberoptic coaxial xenon light source.

Built in emergency xenon back-up integrated into stand.

Light intensity adjustable by the surgeon at the pistol grip.

Integrated continuous motorized magnification changer with factors 0.4X, 0.6X, 1.0X, 1.6X and 2.5X giving magnifications of 2.7, 4.1, 6.8, 10.9 and 17 with fields of view of 80.9MM, 53.9MM, 20.2MM and 12.9MM.

0-180 binoculars F=170 T* coated optics with stereo view for both primary and second surgeon.

All objectives must be built in so that there is no need to ever manually change objective lens. (200MM-415MM internal).

Floorstand must have a motorized column height adjustment that allows for over the head use by the surgeon.

Shall have as a minimum 1:6 pistol grip motorized zoom system with zoom and focus integrated into the microscope body for ease of operation.

Must be able to perform manipulation by the way of electromagnetic clutch for stability and ease for use.

Must have fiberoptic light guide illumination with xenon superlux 180 high intensity illumination with built in xenon back-up.

Must have handgrips which are adjustable and fully integrated to allow light intensity to be increased or decreased.

Must have built in automatic focus that allows focusing from 200MM to 415MM internal, and button activated.

Must have ability for face-to-face surgery that allows the surgeon and assistant to switch positions without any loss in comfort or convenience.

Must have extraordinary image quality, improved resolution and incredible color fidelity while allowing the surgeon to focus up or down the focal plane without changing lenses.

Must have magnetically locked axes for exact positioning.

Must have memory for personal settings of the Xenon light source.

Must have a LCD display that allows for personal settings for up to 9 surgeons.

The floorstand shall have motorized height adjustment, to enable over the head surgery and ability to walk under sterile field when not in use.

Must have four rotating castors to guarantee optimum positioning beside the operating table.

Must have a waterproof foot control with 14 functions.

Must have a 2 year warranty on all parts and labor commencing from date of installation.

Carl Zeiss Meditec is the only known source that can provide a microscope system with the following required features. The Zeiss System must be compatible with existing Zeiss equipment, stereo view (face to face) for the primary surgeon and assistant.

<CONTACT>Liem T Nguyen, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014358780, Email ln18x@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), seeks to procure&nbsp;on a sole source basis for access to patient and national level drug abuse data from&nbsp;SDI Health, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("SDI") having its business at 800 Township Line Road, Yardley, PA 19067. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.5 01-(a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0 million. <br />Services provided by SDI Health, LLC (SDI) will enable NIDA to track drug usage by brand, procedures and diagnostics at the patient level and measure and track drug "loading" dose by brand. Additionally, SDI's reporting supports near real-time measurement of the market's reaction to promotion, allowing for mid-stream adjustments. SDI will provide NIDA their healthcare database, including prescription medications dispensed by retail pharmacies and unique total patient counts, necessary to assess the market activity for (1) prescription stimulants; (2) prescription pain relievers; (3) psychotherapeutics; (4) anti-anxiety; (5) antidepressant (e.g., SSRIs and benzodiazepines); (6) sleep disorder; (7) erectile dysfunction and (8) anti-obesity products. NIDA has a previous third party agreement with the FDA which granted NIDA access to SDI's data and user-friendly report generator. As a result, NIDA has been able to capture and compile numerous reports via SDI's trademarked software and databases.&nbsp;SDI has the largest database (120 million patients available per year) and collects and reports on more longitudinal data than other companies. SDI is the only company that offers a unique service of specifically projecting the distinct number of patients taking a therapy or multiple therapies over time and they have over seven (7) years of unbroken patient level history which will allow NIDA researchers to trend patient level data from 2000 and prescription level data from 1991.&nbsp;The availability and accessible database on patient and national level of drug use provided by SDI has made the company uniquely qualified for this project. No other company can provide the same services and/or database to satisfy the Government requirement. The period of performance is to be 12 months from the award date and with one 12-month option period.<br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions Office, NIDA, on or before 2:00 PM ET May 22, 2009. All questions must be in writing and can be emailed to Liem T Nguyen at ln18x@nih.gov or faxed to 301-480-1358 on or before 2:00 PM ET May 20, 2009. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a contract on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source. NRL will negotiate with Spectra Vista Corporation, 29 Firemen’s Way, Poughkeepsie, New York 12603 for a Field Portable Spectroradiometer System with FLGS-3 Goniometer.  NRL conducts research in the field of hyperspectral remote sensing.  An important research area in hyperspectral remote sensing is the change in the measured reflectance of an object or area when viewed from different angles. This is known as the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). The required field goniometer is the only effective way of measuring BRDF.  NRL will use this instrument to measure and develop BRDF spectral libraries for characterizing battlespace environments; the goniometer instrument will be required to operate in field conditions and cover the necessary spectral range needed for the development of these libraries.  NRL requires a goniometer that meets or exceeds all of the specifications with those of the Spectra Vista HR 1024 system.  This field goniometry is a unique instrument and is the only one in the marketplace that currently meets the required specifications capable of collecting the data NRL needs to further its ongoing research program(s).  The spectrometer must be lightweight (3.3 kg); self contained and can be controlled remotely.  It has a spectral range of 350-2500 nm and it has a spectral sampling bandwidth of less than or equal to 1.5 nm in the range 350 to 1000 nm, less than or equal to 3.8 nm in the range 1000 to 1890 nm and less than or equal to 2.5 nm in the range 1890 to 2500 nm to meet the accuracy requirements needed for the development of NRL’s BRDF spectral libraries. The systems’ spectral resolution must be less than or equal to 1.5 nm in the range 350 to 1000 nm, less than or equal to 3.8 nm in the range 1000 to 1890 nm and less than or equal to 2.5 nm in the range 1890 to 2500 nm.  It is the only commercial spectrometer that combines all of these features and the required spectral features, which are necessary to measure the full directional effect in reflectance.  In addition, the HR 1024 is the only full range spectrometer that is not made with a short, fragile fiber optic cable.  This is a critical design feature, as in a goniometer configuration, the spectrometer must ride in a track configuration over a large distance (a track of large radius), making the use of a fiber optic cable impractical.  The automation allows a full range of directional measurements to be made in 20 minutes.  This capability is necessary to minimize the effect of changing solar angles, independent of the spectrometer movement.  The HR 1024 goniometer design has a central pivot that reduces the effect of self shading, enabling measurements to be made over a larger range of angles. This is also necessary to capture the full range of directional effects.  The HR 1024 goniometer can be broken down into sections, which can be fit into standard cases, for ease of transportation and are light enough to be carried by hand. This is necessary to allow NRL personnel to carry out measurements in remote sites without transportation infrastructure.  The size and weight of the goniometer system (spectrometer and track) are also unique in terms of the total size and weight requirement, allowing the system to be easily used by a team of 1-2 people, which is a requirement and asset for NRL small research team.  Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Establish and Maintain a Primary Care and Prevention Implementation Resource Center Sources Sought (Markety Survey)

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is conducting a market survey to seek potential small business sources, including 8(a), small disadvantaged, HUBZone, woman-owned business and service disabled veteran-owned small business, for a contract to establish and maintain a Primary Care and Prevention Implementation Resource Center (PCPIRC) over the next five years (2010-2014).  

AHRQ is seeking potential sources from qualified small business firms under NAICS Code 541611 (size standard - $7 million) which can demonstrate the knowledge, skills and capacity to support AHRQ’s Prevention/Care Management Implementation and Integration Program.   

The PCPIRC will be a central resource for AHRQ’s Prevention/Care Management Portfolio.  The mission of the Portfolio is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and chronic care management in ambulatory care settings.  The Portfolio fulfills AHRQ’s Congressionally mandated role to convene the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).  The PCPIRC will support the P/CM Implementation and Integration Program in its work to build evidence and facilitate improvements in primary care related to the integration of health information technology, care coordination, patient activation/self management support, and linkages between clinical practices and community-based/public health interventions for prevention and care management.

It is anticipated that the PCPIRC will help build the Nation’s capacity for effective work in the prevention of disease and the promotion of healthy behaviors, with a special emphasis on building successful collaborations across the clinical services, public health, and community sectors. The PCPIRC will use multiple methods (including direct technical assistance, knowledge transfer, and dissemination of tools, resources, and research results) to maximize the benefit of Agency and Department investments in prevention research and programs to communities and individuals.

The contractor must have access to a wide variety of expertise with a core understanding of and experience in: primary care, public health, quality improvement implementation, behavior change, care coordination and self management support.  The contractor should have a deep understanding of programs within HHS and the diverse populations served by the Department. 

Key activities that the PCIRC may conduct for AHRQ’s P/CM Implementation and Integration Program include, but are not limited to the following:

1.	Conducting health services research that may involve both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and that may require preparation of requests for approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
2.	Conducting large and complex needs assessments
3.	Critically evaluating, synthesizing and organizing large volumes of information, which may include assessing and rating evidence from studies that vary widely in content and methodology
4.	Conducting formal external evaluations of programs, tools, and materials 
5.	Providing direct technical assistance to large numbers of groups and individuals, including: developing curricula; teaching; coaching; assisting with strategic planning; troubleshooting; and organizational development activities, including consensus building
6.	Disseminating technical information to multiple audiences through multiple channels (print, electronic, etc.).

It is likely that the PCPIRC contractors will be required to ramp up large technical assistance programs for a large number of federal grantees in a short period of time and be able to provide multiple forms of group and individual technical assistance, including site visits and in-person support, across the United States and in multiple locations simultaneously.  Thus at the time of the award, the contractor must have the capacity to work intensively in any geographic area of the United States.  Additionally, at the time of award, the contractor must possess the capacity to conduct multiple, simultaneous conferences across the country including, but not limited to, activities such as developing curricula, providing faculty and staff, arranging all logistics and providing technical assistance.  

At the time of award, the contractor must have staff who can develop Web-based tools, Web sites, collaborative portals and other multimedia products, and who can create and manage large databases.  The contractor must understand and adhere to federal 508, privacy and security regulations.  

The contractor must have staff who can work on site at AHRQ for either limited or extended periods of time.    

The contractor must have the ability to effectively manage complex projects; demonstrate organizational structure and capabilities to meet project milestones in a timely manner; manage resources and cost expenditures; and adhere to performance based contracting and earned value management contracting.  Coordinating numerous complex tasks across multiple organizations is desired.  Demonstration of extensive project management expertise and experience for large complex government contracts is required, specifically 5-10 government contracts of at least $7 million per contract.  Key managerial staff should be certified in Project Management.  Key personnel must include a technical and managerial staff with at least 5 years of direct experience in practice improvement and prevention in primary care, evaluation, and health communications and multimedia with a focus on web-based tools and communications.  Key personnel must also include a Project Director with a PhD or MD or equivalent experience, with at least 10 years experience as Project Director.

The PCIRC contract will be a 3 year base contract with 2 option years.  AHRQ anticipates there will be 2-4 base contracts awarded with at least 5 subsequent task orders (or delivery orders) to be awarded against the base contracts.   

An example of an activity (task order) that may be required of the contractor follows:

	Within three months of the award of the contract, the contractor will:
•	construct a completely functioning data-base driven, searchable, Web-based tool that catalogs the community-based interventions of 100 projects or programs
•	synthesize the projects’ work plans and conduct a needs assessment of the projects to identify common elements
•	develop a technical assistance program based on the needs assessment
•	provide technical assistance to 100 communities either in groups or individually.  

Interested SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY should submit capability statements (no more than 25 pages in length).  Capability statements should be submitted by e-mail to: Sharon Williams, Contracting Officer, at Sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov.

Capability statements must specifically address the requirements of this notice and clearly identify the firm’s capabilities to meet the criteria for which they are applying for including, but not limited to, information on key staff experience and education and a description of corporate experience with similar projects.  Generic corporate brochures which do not address the requirements for which the firm wishes to be considered will not be considered to be responsive to this market survey. 

Capability statements must be received no later than 12:00 noon, (EDT), on
May 25, 2009.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Solicitation No. HHS-CDC-EEHS-SS-09-11275
<p><br />TITLE: Technical and Scientific Environmental Health <br />Services Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Introduction: This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is studying how Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) can be applied to school violence prevention. One of the goals of CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) is to reduce the prevalence of violence among youth. Several important priorities included in the Center's published research agenda focus on studying how the physical environment influences behavior and risk for violence. The goal of the proposed acquisition is to implement a study to measure the association between scores on using the CPTED tool and measures of fear and violence-related behaviors on school property.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Purpose and Objectives: The primary purpose of this procurement is to provide a firm-fixed price contract to support the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control by implementing a study protocol designed to measure the extent to which scores on the CPTED tool are associated with reports of fear and violence related behaviors on school property.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The objective of the work to be performed under the proposed performance based contract is to recruit approximately 50 middle schools and conduct CPTED assessments independently in each school. Data on fear and violence related behavior shall be collected directly from a representative sample of approximately 75 students from each school. As designed, the protocol also includes data collection from a school counselor. The Contractor shall also consider the availability and utility of supplemental sources of data that can be used to understand potential confounders as well as fear and violence related behavior on school property.<br /><br />The Contractor shall be responsible for furnishing all required personnel, consultants, materials, equipment and supplies to provide the work and services as specified in the order.

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to contract on a sole-source basis with the Center for Home Movies as follows:

				STATEMENT OF WORK
1) Plan and Execute a  two-day symposium of international significance on home movies and amateur film 
2) Prepare a Follow-up Action Plan with recommended steps to take
Period of Performance: July 2009 through December 2010
Home/Amateur Film Symposium

 While amateur film and video has blossomed as an academic pursuit recently, finding adherents in cinema studies and cultural studies programs around the world, the multidisciplinary aspects of amateur media scholarship have not been well-served by academia. Academic conferences
such as Visible Evidence, the Orphan Film Symposium, and the Northeast Historic Film summer symposium, the annual meetings of the Society of Cinema and Media Studies, the Association of Moving Image Archivists, and local institutional programs and series may touch on noncommercial
media, but they do so as part of a larger discussion on media theory, preservation, or filmmaking—in which the unique qualities and concerns of home movies and other amateur films are often largely ignored. At the same time, these conferences and symposia are too narrowly focused on media studies and film history to acknowledge the wide range of uses and effects which amateur films have had, and will continue to have, on fields such as medicine,
psychology, cultural history, fashion, education, and so on. 

The Amateur Film Symposium would bring together leading authorities on uses, scholarship and preservation of amateur moving image media from a wide range of disciplines. It would be the first gathering to address amateur media as a subject in itself, rather than an offshoot of mainstream cinema. This meeting would follow the Orphan Film Symposium model, emphasizing thematic presentations, panels and screenings, and encouraging a productive
conversation between academics, archivists and media makers who work with amateur film.

This symposium  will make a special effort to reach out beyond the archival and film history and film studies communities in order to involve students and scholars in a variety of disciplines. The gathering will also serve as an opportunity to further discussion of new ways of understanding and
priorities for preserving and expanding our amateur film heritage in light of cultural and technological developments of the 21st century. 

The symposium will be held during calendar year 2010 at the Library of Congress’ National Audio-Visual Conservation Center, Packard Campus in Culpeper, VA.

Deliverables
1)	Summary of an understanding of the current state of the field of
home movie and video preservation
2)	Outline of highest-priority areas/subjects for research and inquiry
3)	Sketch for a national plan for preservation including a five-year
timetable of proposed programs for archival, technological and
curatorial developments
4)	Proposals for funding sources of long-term projects involving
amateur film and video

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking to establish an effort to cost share, on a 1:1 minimum basis, development of continuous lower energy, emissions and noise (CLEEN) technologies for civil subsonic jet airplanes to help achieve the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) goals to increase airspace system capacity by reducing significant community noise and air quality emissions impacts in absolute terms and limit or reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions impacts on the global climate.  The CLEEN program is focused on reducing current levels of aircraft noise, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use, and advancing alternative fuels for aviation use.  The focus of this effort is to: (1) mature previously conceived noise, emissions and fuel burn reduction technologies from Technology Readiness Levels  (TRLs) of 3-4 to TRLs of 6-7 to enable industry to expedite introduction of these technologies into current and future aircraft and engines, and (2) assess the benefits and advance the development and introduction of alternative "drop in" fuels for aviation, with particular focus on renewable options, including blends.

<DESC><p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), for the purchase of six custom built Advanced Whole Air Sampler (AWAS) canister assemblies.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) market research showing that NCAR is the only provider of the Advanced Whole Air Sampler (AWAS) canister assemblies to be used on the NOAA P3 aircraft. NCAR has designed and developed Advanced Whole Air Sampler (AWAS) canister assemblies used in research aircraft. The existing AWAS system was designed and built by NCAR, and meets strict specifications in terms of the cleanliness of the canisters: trace gases will be determined to the part-per-trillion level, whereas canisters from other manufacturers regularly have impurities at the part-per-billion level, i.e. a factor of 1000 less clean. Also, the additional AWAS canisters that we request here will have to interface with the existing system built by NCAR. Having this done by a third party would involve a redesign of the system, with attendant substantial cost growth, compatibility issues, and project risk.<br />Delivery date shall be October 10, 2009.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>Performance Work Statement<BR><BR><BR>The purpose of this statement is to seek sources for the equipment listed below. <BR><BR>Provide a lift mechanism to allow employees to raise heavy items above ground level then walk up the stairs and retrieve them or vice versa. <BR>The work space is as follows. The steps descend to a concrete slab that is 91 x 64.  The 64 dimension will have a door that swings to the outside 30 . This will require a platform top of no more than 32 deep although it can be a little wider. This slab is 68 below ground level. The lift mechanism would need to start out at about 32 high and lift to height of about 104 to give the same 32 height on the top side. The unit will need to be weather proof since there is no awning over this stairwell. The bed or platform of this lift will require a cage or guard to keep materials from falling off of it while in motion and will need to hinge out of the way on two sides (one side at the bottom and the opposite at the top) for loading and unloading. A limit switch may be needed to prevent the unit from traveling with the guards not in place. The unit will also require two sets of weatherproof hand controls to raise or lower the platform from either the top of the stairs or the bottom. The unit voltage will need to be 110v.<BR>If unit is chain driven. Chain guards must be provided. If the unit is a scissor type it must have bellows included. <BR><BR>Darren Wolf<BR>Planner / Estimator<BR>918-420-7700<BR>E-Mail : Darren.b.wolf@us.army.mil<BR><BR>

<DESC>U.S. Army RDECOM-Picatinny is announcing a market survey notice for an upgradeto the current Smoke 469B round currently being produced by Saab Bofors Dynamics (SBD), Sweden.  The U.S.  Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has applied for a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) project to qualify the enhanced fuze for the 84mm Smoke 469C.  This project will integrate, test and evaluate an essential fuze upgrade system to the existing 84 mm Smoke 469B round.  The F551 Fuze is designed to replace the FFV957 fuze currently used in the 84mm Smoke 469B round.  The 84mm Smoke 469C should produce the same noise level as compared to current configuration since its propulsion system will remain unchanged.  This will greatly reduce the risk associated with its development by extensive use of integration of existing qualified MAAWS ammunition components.  The Smoke 469B rounds are proprietary to SBD.  Since the USG does not have any technical data rights to the Smoke 469B rounds, interested parties should contact the prime contractor, SBD directly.

<DESC>1- Office requesting the action:  Adaptive Management Group

2- Description of proposed action:  Sole-source acquisition

3- Description of services or supplies needed:  A modification to Contract 07-CR-40-8185 to add work summarized as follows:  The Government requires another season of data collection to strengthen the findings made to date on the contract and thereby provide more information to assist in the management of endangered fish to ensure the Government's uninterrupted operations in the San Juan River Basin.  Therefore, two complex reaches along the San Juan River will be sampled once in August 2009 during base flow for young endangered fishes.  This data, combined with sample data to be collected in the Spring of 2009, as well as reports on habitat mapping, interpretation and analysis of data, and integration of fish sampling and habitat data, will be delivered to the Government in the Spring of 2010.  
4- Estimated cost	$ 212,000

5- Authority:  FAR 6.302-1   Only one responsible source
5a- Address specifically how the authority applies:  FAR 6.302-1(1)(b)(1):  When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by --          (i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with                            unique capabilities;
Explanation:  The conditions encountered during the field sampling portion of work performed under Contract 07-CR-40-8185 were and are much different than what the Government expected when the contract was initially awarded.  Namely, at no fault of the contractor, the numbers of endangered fish that were expected to be captured fell far short of the quantities needed to insure statistical rigor.  All statistical tests require a certain number of samples, which is dependent upon variation in the samples and the accuracy that the researcher requires.  The inability to capture the required number of fish to give us the statistical accuracy  needed requires that additional sampling be done.  This additional sampling is essentially another year's worth of work--a spring and fall sampling period and is entirely related to and a continuation of the previous work performed on Contract 07-CR-40-8185.  The current contractor has the expertise and knowledge of how such previousl collected information has been obtained in order to properly integrate it with this planned work.  Contracting with another contractor at this point in the project would create undue hardships to the Government by requiring Government personnnel to integrate information that it had virtually no role in collecting.
FAR 6.302-1(1)(b)(2): The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material; or similar circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source.
Explanation:  The Navajo Nation has only permitted 4 contractors to conduct work on Navajo Nation lands, where 100% of this work is occurring.  The Navajo Nation has indicated to the customer that they had not issued permits to any additional contractors which would enable effective competition.
6- Effort made to obtain offers from multiple sources:  Contract 07-CR-40-8185 was solicited on a full and open competitive basis.  Notwithstanding such, only one proposal was received, which is attributed mainly to the restricted number of contractors permitted by the Navajo Nation to perform work on its lands.  The Government has no information which would suggest that a follow-on competition for the same work would yield a different result.  This additional work requirement was synopsized on 02 April 2009.
7- Description of market research performed:  Market research was not performed because the Government is already aware of all of the contractors that are permitted to perform research on Navajo Nation lands.  The Government has confirmed with the Navajo Nation that it has not issued permits to any other contractor outside of the four known contractors.
8- Determination of fair and reasonable cost:  Per FAR 15.404-1, the Contracting Officer will determine that negotiation settlement is achieved at a fair and reasonable cost, based on historical cost data and analysis of cost and pricing data.
9- Other facts supporting use of other than full and open competition:  If this work is not continued with the current contractor, the Government has significant concerns that integral continuity of data collection and analysis would not be sustainable in the event another contractor was selected.  This would likely result in an undue hardship to the Government by requiring it to integrate information that it had virtually no role in collecting, which, in turn, would compromise the integrity of any analysis that would be performed on such data.
10- List any sources that have expressed interest in this proposed acquisition:  To date, no responses to the presolicitation notice that was released on 02 April 2009 have been received.
11- Effort to overcome barriers to competition for future acquisition:  The Government does not anticipate having the same requirements after FY2010.
12- Certification:Preparer's / requestor's name:Kent Munro  //s//Preparer's / requestor's title:Contract Specialist

I certify that the information and documentation provided with this requested justification are accurate and believe they form a valid basis to proceed with the requested acquisition without full and open competition.

<ARCHDATE>06252009
<CONTACT>Amy L Kruse, Program Manager, DSO, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 000-000-0000, Email amy.kruse@darpa.mil
<DESC>Special Notice DARPA-SN-09-37; NEOVISION2 Proposer’s Day Workshop; DATE:  May 26, 2009; REGISTRATION DEADLINE:  May 20, 2009; TECHNICAL POC:  Dr. Amy A. Kruse, DARPA/DSO; Email:  amy.kruse@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso; Website Submission: https://dsobaa.sainc.com 

In anticipation of a potential program on the topic of NEOVISION2, DARPA is hosting a Proposer’s Day Workshop that will provide critical information on the program vision, the program milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team. The workshop will be held on May 26, 2009, in Arlington, VA.

DARPA is soliciting research proposals to revolutionize the underlying technologies for unmanned sensor systems.  This effort seeks to emulate the mammalian visual pathway by implementing advanced models and algorithmic emulations of the entire visual pathway - from retina to the visual cortex. The objective of the effort is to surpass regular engineering approaches, achieving significant improvements in size, weight, power, and performance (SWaPP).  It is expected that neuromorphic solutions will achieve the desired performance faster, more reliably, and in a smaller, lighter, lower power format than conventional designs. The qualities the program strives to achieve are: 

	Efficiency of design – in terms of size, weight, and power
	Robustness of function – with respect to signal-to-noise metrics, clutter,              limitation of sensors or available information, and dynamic range
	Unprecedented performance –  related to performance on object/scene/context 
	recognition across hundreds of categories
	Data flow – emulation of the biological movement of data matching signal transduction 	and connectivity in the nervous system (serial vs. parallel vs. massively parallel) 
	Efficient methods of computation – analysis of analog vs. digital hardware trade-offs, and at a higher level, how elementary operations and signal interactions are grouped together to achieve more complex functions. 

DARPA seeks innovative approaches to sensor technology that display characteristics associated with the human visual system such as light adaptability, object recognition, and background suppression; while at the same time designing and developing a functioning prototype that credibly demonstrates size, weight, power, and performance compatible with unmanned military reconnaissance platforms. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

The teaming and information session will be held at the at the offices of Strategic Analysis Inc., Liberty Conference Center, 4075 Wilson Blvd. STE 300, Arlington, VA 22203, on May 26, 2009 from 9:00AM ET until 5:00PM ET. The goals of the teaming and information session are: (a) to introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the NEOVISION2 program vision and goals; (b) to explain the mechanics of a DARPA Program and the milestones and metrics of this particular effort, and (c) to encourage and promote teaming arrangements among potential organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the NEOVISION2 program goals. The teaming and information session will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the teaming and information session participants. Additionally, a teaming website is provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at http://www.sainc.com/NEO2Teaming.

Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas, which will be detailed in an impending BAA, will be critical to the success of the program. DARPA will not be funding component technologies that address only a subset of the technologies listed in the BAA. Appropriate teaming will be a critical element in responding to the DARPA NEOVISION2 solicitation. 

NEOVISION2 Proposer’s Day Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions during the poster session. Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging are given on the OLE registration website at http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=676 .

There is no fee for the NEOVISION2 Proposer’s Day Workshop. Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 90 attendees, no more than 3 attendees per organization) and early registration is strongly recommended. The registration cutoff date is May 20, 2009, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first. Further administrative information is available from Ms. Grace Rigdon (Grace.Rigdon.ctr@darpa.mil). Additional technical information can be obtained from Dr. Amy Kruse (Amy.Kruse@darpa.mil). Please refer to the NEOVISION2 Proposer’s Day in your correspondence. This announcement is not a request for proposals. 

This announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned.  Nor does this announcement guarantee any funding should a Broad Agency Announcement be published related to these workshops.

<DESC>Sole Source Award for ERM Perfect License:
This sole source award is to CRTechnologies.  

The ERM perfect License includes the following: 

ERM Perfect License and Annual Support.  Period of Performance: one (1) year from date of award.  Quantity: 1.  Unit of Measure: each.  FOB Destination to DFAS-Rome, 325 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441

The period of performance is 12 months from date of contract award.

The requirement is for a brand name product, ERM Perfect license, available from only one source, CRTechnologies.

The purpose of this order is to purchase software required to implement a classified version of the Corporate Document Management System (CEDMS) at DFAS-Rome.  The software must be identical to the current software supporting the unclassified version of CEDMS 2.0 at DAPS-Mechanicsburg.  The Army has requested DFAS deploy classified version of CEDMS to store classified disbursing vouchers originating in Theater.  

The current CEDMS 2.0 configuration must be identical in both environments to minimize cost, maintain current system functionality, security and to eliminate implementation risks or implementation delays. CRTechnologies software, ERM Perfect, is a component of this configuration.  ERM-Perfect is the core software component in CEDMS 2.0.  

The Defense Automated Production Service (DAPS) previously procured the above listed software under full and open competition.  This included licenses for development and testing.  Those licenses have been maintained since and are currently supported under contract number HC1013-06-f-2070.  The proposal to utilize the above outlined software suit logically flows from the current production environment into the new Classified CEDMS environment.

If these exact licenses are not purchased and installed in the classified version of CEDMS the following adverse actions would occur:

• Two separate system CEDMS software configurations would result in increased software maintenance and pose increased risk of system failure and downtime.

• If this specific software is not purchased DFAS would need to procure additional technical services to reprogram CEDMS to use different software components.

• Increase security risk.  DFAS requires each system to be certified and accredited in accordance with DoD regulation.  If the current system configuration is modified or altered the DIACAP on the unclassified version of CEDMS will be invalid.  The new software components would need to be revalidated to ensure they meet DoD security guidelines.

Based on research performed  online at GSA Advantage and also via Internet through Google and other search engines, there are no other vendors that provide ERM-Perfect other than the manufacturer, CRTechnologies.

<DESC>General Information
The purpose of this request is to gather information to conduct additional market research for planning and decision making.  This is a request for information only.  It is not contractually binding.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the information provided, and will not pay for any costs associated with information collected.  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary.

The Geospatial Service & Technology Center (GSTC), located in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a detached unit of the USDA Forest Service Washington Office.

Background and Context
As the use of handheld GPS receivers increases, GSTC is receiving requests to make Forest Service special purpose maps available on recreational-grade GPS receivers.  A project is underway that addresses travel management maps that portray roads and trails on Forest Service land.  They are available to the public in hardcopy and PDF formats, but there is increasing interest in their availability on handheld GPS receivers.  GSTC is conducting a technology analysis to determine the feasibility of converting source data used to produce these travel management maps to a format that can be loaded onto GPS receivers.  The technology analysis addresses the following: a) COTS solutions; b) open source solutions; c) proprietary constraints; d) technology constraints; and e) possible production workflows.  While the current project is specific to travel management maps, GSTC anticipates that information gathered with this RFI will be used for future projects with similar objectives.

Requirements
1.	Convert travel management digital data to a format that can be loaded to a handheld GPS receiver.  The data may be in a source format such as ESRI geodatabase or shapefile, or in a finished product format such as PDF.
2.	The GPS version of the map must maintain the symbology and annotation as portrayed on the hardcopy map, or at least a reasonable approximation.
3.	The production workflow must produce standalone files that can be distributed to GPS users to load with their COTS GPS software.
4.	The map extent on the GPS receiver should be no smaller than 7.5 minutes by 7.5 minutes.
5.	Performance (such as refresh rates) must be tolerable.

RFI Objectives
1.	Determine if there are open source solutions to achieve the stated requirements.
2.	Determine if GPX files can be enhanced to support attribution and symbology requirements.
3.	Determine if any GPS vendors support an open source workflow to achieve stated requirements.
4.	Determine if third-party solutions exist.
5.	Determine if vendors have interest in collaborating on an open source solution.
6.	Determine if vendors have interest in collaborating on a proprietary solution.
7.	Determine if there is interest in achieving project requirements by developing a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).
8.	Determine what elements of the workflow are achieved by existing solutions and which are not.
9.	Determine if GPS or third-party vendors have interest in accepting Forest Service data and creating the target product for dissemination through their own channels.

RFI Responses
In your response to this RFI, please address the following:
1.	Respond to each of the previous eight objectives (not applicable is an acceptable response).
2.	Define the market share held by your company (if applicable) in the handheld recreational GPS receiver market (of all units sold, what percentage defines your share of the market).  Please provide supporting documentation.
3.	Provide any additional information you feel is important or appropriate that is not addressed in the RFI Objectives.
4.	Provide contact information for continued communication:
a.	Name
b.	Telephone number
c.	E-mail address
d.	Backup contact if desired


Forest Service/GSTC Contact Information
Please provide your response to Byron Taylor by the closing date of this RFI. Questions regarding the RFI process should be directed to Nelda Montgomery

<DESC>Community Announcement NNH09ZDA009J:NASA intends to release a Discovery Program Draft AONASAs Science Mission Directorate (SMD) intends to release a Draft Announcement ofOpportunity (AO) in June 2009 for Discovery Program missions. The Discovery Programconducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigations in SMDs planetaryprograms under a not-to-exceed cost cap. It is anticipated that approximately two tothree Discovery investigations will be selected for 9-month Phase A concept studiesthrough this AO. At the conclusion of these concept studies, it is planned that oneDiscovery investigation will be selected to continue into Phase B and subsequent missionphases. There will be no Missions of Opportunity (MO) solicited as part of this AO. AllMO are now solicited through the Stand Alone Mission of Opportunity Notice (SALMON) AO.Discovery Program investigations must address NASAs planetary science goals as describedin Solar System Exploration, NASAs 2006 roadmap for planetary science. The roadmap maybe found at http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy/	 .Investigations may focus on any body in the Solar System, excluding the Earth and theSun, and including Mars and the Moon. Investigations may not focus on extra-solarplanetary systems.Discovery Program investigations may propose the use of Advanced Stirling RadioisotopeGenerators (ASRGs) for missions enabled by radioisotope power systems.	If selected forflight, NASA will provide up to two ASRGs, including the services associated with theirprovisioning on space missions, as GFE, and their costs will not be included in the costcap. The costs for mission-specific accommodations or qualifications, however, are theresponsibility of the PI and must be included within the cost cap.  Launch Vehicle costs and procurement will be the responsibility of NASA. Launch vehiclestandard services will be provided as GFE and the cost will not be included in the costcap. The cost of mission specific and special launch services, including the use ofradioisotope heating units (RHUs), is the responsibility of the PI and must be includedwithin the cost cap.  NASA is reviewing the possibility of offering options for differentlaunch vehicle capabilities and their impact on the cost cap. Investigations are capped at a life-cycle cost of $425M (FY10), excluding standard launchservices and, if required, ASRGs.  Lower-cost investigations are encouraged.The schedule for the solicitation is intended to be: Release of draft AO (target)			       June 2009 Release of final AO (target)			       November 2009 Pre-proposal conference				~3 weeks after final AO release Proposals due 						90 days after AO release Selection for competitive Phase A studies	July 2010 (target) Concept study reports due				 May 2011 (target) Down-selection					       November 2011 (target) Launch date							 NLT December 31, 2016The Draft Discovery AO will be based on the Standard PI-led Mission AO Template availableat http://sso.larc.nasa.gov/aosimplification.html	. Proposers should read the DraftDiscovery AO carefully when it is released.NASA has not approved the issuance of the Discovery AO and this notification does notobligate NASA to issue the AO and solicit proposals. Any costs incurred by prospectiveinvestigators in preparing submissions in response to this notification or the plannedDraft Discovery AO are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk.Further information will be posted on the Discovery Program Acquisition Page athttp://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/       as it becomes available.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Ansoft Corporation 225 W Station Square Ste 200, Pittsburgh, PA 15219-1115, for the optimetrics and multiprocessing node licenses for an existing license for HFSS. The Optimetrics is a versatile optional software program that adds parametric, optimization, sensitivity, and statistical analysis capabilities to HFSS,(Q3D Extractor Maxwell, Node Locked License). Optimetrics automates the design-optimization process for high–performance electronic devices by quickly identifying optimal values for deign parameters that satisfy user-specified constraints. Coupled to Ansoft electromagnetic-field simulation software, optimetrics delivers optimized designs that favorably impact the bottom line. The multiprocessing for HFSS, Node Locked License enables engineers to take advantage of the increased computational capabilities of computers with more than one cpu (either multi-processor and/or multi-core machines). By using the multi-processing license with HFSS one can see about a 20/30% reduction in total solve time going from one (1) processor to (2) processors. The two modules that NIST is buying are add-ons to the main software computing program; they are not stand alone software that can be purchased from different vendors. They must work with the main program which is HFSS.

A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about May 20, 2009. 
Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis. Capability statements may be emailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation.  A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. A TASK ORDER IS BEING AWARDED UNDER THE REMEDIAL ACTION CONTRACT 2 (RAC2), CONTRACT NO. EP-S1-06-03.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Task Order obligates $115,451 for preparation of a Work Plan and Cost Estimate for work to be performed at the Silresim Chemical Corp. (Silresim) Superfund Site in Lowell, MA 01852-4420. Once the Work Plan and Cost Estimate are approved, additional Recovery funds will be obligated for completion of the effort. This effort has a total estimated value of $10 - $25 Million. The purpose of this task order is to implement a Remedial Action (RA) at the Silresim Superfund Site. The Contractor will have overall responsibility for construction of a Final Engineered Barrier over a portion of the Silresim Property and implementing thermally-enhanced Soil-Vapor Extraction (SVE) for the reduction of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in shallow soil and groundwater. Electrical Resistance Heating (ERH) will be used for VOC reduction. ERH is a "thermally-enhanced" variation of SVE that employs electrical current to heat both the underlying soil and groundwater; the heated contaminated media liberates substantially more contamination which can then be captured, treated and/or destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The period of performance is from May 12, 2009 through April 30, 2011. The task order has been issued under the Region 1 Small Business Remedial Action Contract 2 (RAC2) on 11 May 2009, and is task order number 045-RARA-0122. The RAC2 contract number is EP-S1-06-03. Administrative Contracting Officer for the task order will be Sharlene Begley, Supervisory Contracting Officer, Begley.sharlene@epa.gov, (617)918-1055.<br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the Agency's RAC2 contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing RAC2 contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing RAC2 contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (services) prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Request for Proposals AG-3151-S-09-0015 communicates the Government’s requirement to prospective contractors and solicits proposals for a competitive acquisition as follows:

The objective of this acquisition is to obtain online marketing services for the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) in accordance with the attached Solicitation.  The successful Offeror(s) shall provide all necessary labor, supplies, materials, equipment, software, and office space to conduct online sales transactions for commodities owned by 
CCC. 

The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation.  The anticipated terms and conditions that will apply to the contract are set forth in the attached Solicitation.  This contract will be awarded for a base period of one year from June 15, 2009 through June 14, 2010 with up to four option periods of one year each.

CCC will only obtain Online Marketing Services through an existing service provider and has no interest in purchasing, renting or developing any computer hardware or software.  Responses to this solicitation that do not clearly indicate the Offeror has an existing online marketing system that meets all of the requirements stated within the attached Solicitation will be considered non-responsive and will receive no further consideration.    

The attached Solicitation describes the USDA/CCC’s requirement for online marketing services for transacting sales of CCC-owned commodities.  CCC’s definition of commodities for purposes of this solicitation includes wheat, feed grains (barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, rice, and soybeans), pulse crops (dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas, large chickpeas) other oilseeds (canola, crambe, flax, mustard, rapeseed, safflower, sesame, and sunflower), cotton, peanuts, sugar, and dairy products (nonfat dry milk, butter and cheese).
 
Offeror’s proposals must include all of the information requested in the attached Solicitation:  

Technical and Business Management:

The Offeror shall submit a Technical and Business Management Proposal as described in Section L of the Solicitation.  This part of the proposal shall consist of the sections described in L 11.  Note that Offerors may be required to successfully pass a Live Test Demonstration which demonstrates their system’s capability to meet the Government’s functional and technical requirements.  A pass/fail factor is assigned to the Live Test Demonstration.  Failure to pass the Live Test Demonstration will preclude an Offeror from further consideration. 

Offerors are specifically cautioned that the Technical and Business Management Proposal must not contain any discussions of or references to cost/price.  

Past Performance:

The Offeror shall complete the Cover Letter and forward it with the Past Performance Questionnaire, which are provided as Attachment C of the Solicitation to be completed by not less than five references who can provide past performance information about the Offeror as prime contractor on previous contracts similar in size, scope complexity and results achieved.  Completed Past Performance Questionnaires must be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer electronically, by fax, or in hard copy, and must be received on or before 12:00 Noon EST, Tuesday, June 02, 2009. 

Cost/Price:

The Offeror shall complete the Price Schedule included in Section B. of the Solicitation for the base period and all option periods.  Note:  In the Cost/Price Proposal the Offeror is also required to identify and itemize each and every fee that it intends to assess against the USDA/CCC, against participants in a commodity sale, and against the vendor purchaser, including but not limited to transaction fees and access fees.  Each fee must be identified by name, purpose of fee and an amount or method of calculation.  All fees imposed by the Contractor, whether they are to be imposed against USDA/CCC, a vendor participant in the commodity sale, or the vendor purchaser shall be part of the evaluation process.

Proposal Evaluation Factors:   

The Government will rank the Offeror’s capabilities using three evaluation criteria: (1) Technical and Management Approach, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Cost/Price.  Each non-cost factor is individually less important than Cost and Price.  When combined, Technical and Management Approach and Past Performance are approximately equal to Cost/Price.  

Award to the successful Offeror will be made using “Best Value” Selection Process as described in Section M of the Solicitation.  The Technical Evaluation Team (TET) will evaluate all proposals to identify all contractors whose proposals offer best value to the government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) and the evaluation criteria. 

Award may be made without further discussions. Offers should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a technical and price standpoint, which the offeror can submit to the Government. The Government may, after evaluation of proposals, conduct further oral or written discussion as appropriate, with all offerors whose proposals are within a competitive range.

The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government’s best interest to do so.

Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  

Questions and Answers:  

Questions concerning this RFP must be submitted electronically to both the Contracting Officer and Contractor Support Staff listed in the RFP to be received on or before 12:00 Noon EST, Monday, May 18, 2009.  Responses to questions will be posted on FedBizOpps not later than 4:00 PM EST, Wednesday, May 20, 2009.   
Instructions for responses:  
Responses to this RFP shall be sent per the instructions below to be received on or before 12:00 Noon EST, Tuesday, June 02, 2009. 
The Technical and Business Management Proposal (Part I) and Cost Proposal (Part II) must be submitted in two separate documents.

<CONTACT>Michael A. Crawford, Contract Specialist, Phone 2022831364, Fax 2022831290, Email michael.a.crawford@irs.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation, TIRNO-09-Q-COB12, provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-31 are incorporated into this RFQ.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210. The small business size standard is $25 million. 

CLIN 0001 Cenzic Hailstorm Professional License - Annual Term Subscription, 5 seats, 2 Named users, seat (Machine ID) based Cenzic Hailstorm Pro Software Maintenance Based on Machine ID's-Includes all software maintenance, upgrades and updates, unlimited number of Web applications, unlimited scans (annual subscription) Cenzic Hailstorm Full Smart Attack Library includes regular library updates and standard support from 5:00 am to 5:00 pm PST.  Period of Performance is March 31, 2009 to March 30, 2010.  The IRS intends to restore coverage for maintenance back to March 31, so your quote should include any applicable reinstatement fees.

CLIN 0002 Hailstorm Professional Training, 2 days, onsite class, up to 10 students.  Travel and expenses not included.

The IRS is seeking competitive RFQs for the following brand name requirement, “Cenzic Hailstorm Professional."   The rationale supporting this brand name requirement is that without this scanner software, the IRS will not be able to meet federal mandated compliance monitoring and vulnerability assessment requirements.  The IRS’ Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRC) is in need of a web-based application specific vulnerability scanner.  Our existing vulnerability scanners (ISS scanner, Nessus, Nmap, and OAT) only performed a handful of vulnerability checks and no tool in our repository did a comprehensive scan of databases.  With over 2100 databases throughout the IRS enterprise, some of which contain extremely sensitive information, it was determined that a more robust database scanner was a necessity.  The Cenzic Hailstorm web-based scanning software was found to be the only product able to scan (at the application layer) the number of different database types: Oracle, MS-SQL, Sybase, and MySQL and handle DB2 on the mainframe, which is an absolute necessity for the IRS.

This is an RFQ and brand name justification to procure Cenzic Hailstorm Professional License and 2-day, on-site training.  The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of other brand names but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent.  All manufacturers that can perform the equivalent function/services should submit their technical qualifications and literature to the following email address: Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov.  

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-31 are applicable to this procurement: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors – Commercial Items, and FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition. Offerors shall include a fully executed copy of FAR provisions at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with their offer. FAR Clauses 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Per 12.603(b) the SF 1449 is not used. FAR clause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans and 52.232-33, Payment of Electronic Funds Transfer – Central Contractor Registration. 

All responsible sources that can provide the above requirements and deliver all products shall submit written quotations no later than 2 days from the posted date of this announcement. The government intends to award a firm fixed price order. The Vendor shall be selected based on the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  All quotes must include price(s); Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted. All questions must be submitted by email to Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR>Solicitation number F6TSCE9085A001 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This request for Quote is due by 21 May 2009, 9:00am Pacific Time.  The RFQ will result in a firm fixed price contract.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334419. <BR><BR>This acquisition is under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This requirement is for:<BR><BR>SERVICES NON-PERSONAL: Furnish all labor, tools, equipment, material, transportation and supervision to:<BR><BR>AUTOMATION UPGRADE CO2 CENSORS<BR><BR>Modification for existing program:  Modify the existing programming to control mixing and outside air dampers based on CO2 level.  Program existing so that all air handlers are controlled off the Outside Air Temperature Sensor on Multi Zone Unit 2.  Ensure the damper opening is consistent with CO2 levels.  Modify existing graphic to show new sensors.  Final termination at DDC pane for the new sensors.<BR><BR>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A BRAND NAME CONTRACT using simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13 to procure:  AUTOMATION UPGRADE CO2 CENSORS for the Washington Air National Guard, 254 RHF, Camp Murray, Tacoma, WA. The Government intends to award a brand name contract for above product to SIEMENS.<BR><BR>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD BRAND NAME TO SIEMENS using the simplified acquisition procedures. Only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  In this project, we will be modify the existing programming to control mixing and outside air dampers based on CO2 level.  Part of that system is the Direct Digital Control (DDC) system that controls and monitors the HVAC units.  The DDC system consists of electronic devices that attach to various points on the HVAC system, and a central control panel.  These components then interface with the Installation DDC Infrastructure that is already established to run all of the facilities for the Western WA ANG.  This established backbone is a Siemens brand system.  <BR><BR>The components that are currently in place are Siemens components.  This contract would augment those items necessary for operation and monitoring of the new HVAC system.  The individual components must be able to interface and communicate with the existing Siemens backbone system.  <BR><BR>There are components from other manufacturers that the Siemens infrastructure can monitor, however, only Siemens products are able to be controlled by the operating system that resides in the BCE section.  From our terminal, we can turn on, turn off, and adjust all the HVAC systems for the base.  This gives us the ability to immediately troubleshoot and adjust HVAC units in case there are problems.  Other products would require a third party interface to translate information, and a separate computer program to run just that one building.  We had this arrangement in one of our buildings at one time and had to replace it because it did not work.  Siemens technicians periodically come down and perform maintenance on the code in the program, and this is where much of the conflict comes in with other components.<BR><BR>As this is a replacement of one small part of an overall system that has been in place for numerous years, this is not a new requirement.  Any future component replacements of the DDC system would need to also be Siemens products.<BR><BR>The Siemens brand products are carried by many distributors, so competition among vendors is available.<BR><BR>All quotations received within 7 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement. For specific questions, please contact Heidi R. Weber, Contract Specialist, heidi.weber@ang.af.mil.

Length of service<BR>includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<BR>successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<BR>performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<BR><BR>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<BR>King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<BR>Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A<BR>contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<BR>accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR><BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as<BR>numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any<BR>employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or<BR>professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer<BR>System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than<BR>$27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour<BR>would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage<BR>rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those<BR>job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate<BR>for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates<BR>that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour<BR>conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an<BR>individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope<BR>of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which<BR>this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for<BR>that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures<BR>described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.<BR><BR>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<BR>industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<BR>professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<BR>who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<BR>consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<BR>specifications;<BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<BR>modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<BR>related to user or system design specifications;<BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<BR>programs related to machine operating systems; or<BR>    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<BR>requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you<BR>work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<BR>and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<BR> If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<BR>regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<BR>premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<BR>(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<BR>overtime work).<BR><BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<BR>employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<BR>in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This<BR>includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<BR>ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<BR>and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or<BR>explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance<BR>operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All<BR>operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<BR><BR>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<BR>represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<BR>ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<BR>which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<BR>employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<BR>like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<BR>incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials<BR>are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<BR>ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<BR>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<BR>local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<BR>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<BR>employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<BR>determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR>following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<BR>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<BR>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<BR>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<BR>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<BR>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<BR>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<BR>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear<BR>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<BR>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<BR>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<BR>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<BR>links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<BR>http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web<BR>site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<BR>not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<BR>be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<BR>determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<BR>relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<BR>classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such<BR>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<BR>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<BR>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<BR>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<BR>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<BR>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<BR>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<BR>conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<BR>proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<BR>proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage<BR>rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<BR>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<BR>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<BR>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<BR>performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<BR>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<BR>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<BR>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<BR>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<BR>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<BR>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<BR>the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<BR><BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<BR>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<BR>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<BR>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<BR>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<BR>classifications listed in the wage determination<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 312221 with a small business size standard of 1000 employees. This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business under the NAICS code identified above. ***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase Cigarettes for Certification as Standard Reference Materials (SRMs). ***

Background:

Cigarette ignition of upholstered furniture and mattresses has been and continues to be the largest single cause of fire deaths in the United States.  To mitigate these losses, both the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the State of California have promulgated, or are in the process of promulgating, regulations that limit the susceptibility of these soft furnishings to ignition by a lit cigarette.  There are also standard tests for cigarette ignition resistance that are used by the upholstered furniture industries. 

The ignition tests for both mattresses and upholstered furniture involve placing a lit cigarette on a substrate that is either the finished product or an assembly meant to be indicative of the finished product.  

In all these tests, the current test cigarette (CTC) is a commercial product, specified by its length (85 mm &#61617; 2 mm), a tobacco packing density (0.270 g/cm3 &#61617; 0.020 g/cm3), mass (1.1 g &#61617; 0.1 g), and the absence of a filter tip.  This particular cigarette had been selected because early data indicated that it had the highest ignition propensity of any of the cigarettes examined.  As furnishing items resisting ignition by the CTC have replaced older pieces, there has been a sizable reduction in the number of furnishings fires and casualties.

In February 2008, the manufacturer of the CTC ceased production of the cigarette.  This has led to demand for some type of successor to the CTC.  Working with the CPSC, NIST is developing a standard reference cigarette, NIST SRM 1196, for this purpose.

Since 2004, an increasing number of states have required that all cigarettes be of low ignition strength, as measured using ASTM E 2187, Standard Test Method for the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes.  To measure the low ignition propensity of the new, less fire-prone cigarettes, a small heat sink is used in the testing.  To quantify the performance of the stronger CTC and SRM 1196, a larger heat sink is to be used.  NIST has developed this modification to ASTM E 2187.  

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

 Line Item 0001: Cigarettes for Certification as Standard Reference Materials (SRMs), which shall meet the minimum specifications outlined in the attachment (SRM cigarette specifications.doc).

The Contractor shall provide pricing for the following quantities:

1.	1,000,000 cigarettes (5,000 cartons);
2.	1,500,000 cigarettes (7,500 cartons);
3.	2,000,000 cigarettes (10,000 cartons).

The price shall not include taxes.  NIST will arrange approval from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms for the waiving of Federal taxes.  The manufacturer will obtain exemption from state taxes, using the pack disclaimer noted in section 1.2 of the Minimum Specifications (see attachment).

Upon manufacture, the cigarettes shall be shipped promptly to NIST in a refrigerated truck.  The temperature should be near 0 &#61509;C. 

NIST will arrange with the State of Maryland for the shipment into Maryland of cigarettes that do not meet the requirements for "fire-safe" cigarettes.

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. 

Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government.  The Technical Acceptability factor is a go/no-go factor.  Offerors who meet this factor will then be evaluated for delivery time and past performance. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Acceptability factor "Meeting the Minimum Specifications," 2) Delivery Time, 3) Past Performance and 4) Price.  

Delivery time and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal importance to price. If delivery time and past performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.

Delivery Time:

Delivery time for the final shipment of cigarettes shall be 14 weeks or less after NIST testing and acceptance of the prototype cigarettes (as outlined in the specifications), or acceptance of Contractor’s ignition strength certification documentation, whichever method is offered by Contractor.  Quicker delivery time adds value.

Past Performance:

Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product & service provided and the Contractors history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables. 

Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates. Offerors must provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar products have been provided. The Contractor must include the references name, contact person, and contact information in the quotation.

A.   BACKGOUND 
On September 15, 2008 the three political factions in Zimbabwe (MDC-T, MDC-M, and ZANU-PF) signed a power-sharing agreement (known as the Global Political Agreement or GPA), which led to the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU) when MDC-T President Morgan Tsvangirai and MDC-M President Arthur Mutambara were sworn in as Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, respectively, on February 10.  Subsequently, on February 13, ministers representing all three parties undertook the oath of office.  The GNU is an interim establishment until such time that constitutional reform and fresh elections can occur.  

Only once the GNU demonstrates adequate progress toward achievement of a common set of donor principles (commitment to timely elections, unfettered humanitarian access, respect for human rights and rule of law, media reform, and macro-economic stabilization) will recovery and development assistance on both a bilateral and multilateral basis commence.  Nonetheless, donors realize that the success of the GNU and its ability to achieve the donor principles is, in part, contingent on internationally-provided technical assistance.  Toward this end, the USG has identified a number of transitional activities that will assist the GNU to succeed in meeting the principles that have been laid out and that will begin to capitalize on opportunities to further a reformist agenda.  

Key to successful transition will be the GNU’s re-engagement with the International Financial Institutions and the formulation of a stabilization plan to counter the dire economic decline that has been spiraling out of control.  USAID, in concert with other donors, will seek to support the GNU in its efforts through a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF).  It is also essential that bilateral donor programs support the economic stabilization and recovery process.  Hence, monitoring the overall economic situation and providing accurate reporting to partners and stakeholders is needed, as well as the technical expertise to shape the activities of the MDTF and of the USG program.  
In anticipation of being able to incrementally begin activities in the realm of economic recovery/development, USAID undertook a full sectoral review and programmatic design in February 2009.  This led to the drafting of an economic growth strategy for the Mission, inclusive of macro-economic technical assistance, private sector development, agricultural recovery, trade and investment, and livelihoods programs, as well as the drafting of scopes of work for each sub-sector that can be rolled out individually as conditions allow.  In time, as adequate progress against the principles is achieved, the Mission expects to implement a robustly-funded and comprehensive economic growth program.  

B.  BASIC RESPONSIBILITIES

Based in Harare, the PSC Senior Economics Advisor (SEA) will have primary responsibility for the development, management, monitoring, and evaluation of a multi-sectoral and complex economic growth program in Zimbabwe.  The program will be rolled out in a fashion that is commensurate with GOZ progress against achieving the donor principles.  

A significant part of the SEA responsibilities is to identify key leaders and economic experts, including those within the donor economist group in country as well as other major actors, and establish sound professional relationships that will enable him/her to provide economic updates and analysis to the USAID/Zimbabwe Senior Management Team, senior U.S. Embassy officials, and Washington colleagues.  S/he is the USAID/Zimbabwe professional expert on all economic issues and activities within the host country and as such is the principal advisor to Mission management and staff on all economic design issues and the timing of new program assistance.  Another significant role of the incumbent will be to provide leadership and guidance in the development of coordinated donor/GOZ strategies, particularly with respect to economic growth and stabilization programs, ensuring that USG activities are well-coordinated with those of other bilateral and multilateral donors.  In addition, the incumbent will give technical insight and a USG perspective to complementary initiatives that are funded under a Multi-Donor Trust Fund to which the USG is a contributing member.  In addition, the SEA will be USAID/Zimbabwe’s principal point of contact with the GOZ in identifying needs and negotiating USG activities that impact on Zimbabwe’s economy.  

The SEA will report to the Program Officer, but h/she will be expected to operate with a great degree of independence in dealing with complex programs and high-level US and GOZ top government officials and other counterparts, and USAID partners in designing and managing a comprehensive set of technical assistance programs.  In the first year of employment, the SEA will not have any supervisory responsibilities but will play a critical mentoring role for USAID/Zimbabwe Program Office staff and other technical office staff, including new hires brought on board to help manage an economic portfolio.
 
C.  SPECIFIC DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The selected candidate will have the following specific duties.

•	Develop, oversee, monitor, and evaluate programs designed to:

o	Provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance of Zimbabwe related to monetary and fiscal reform.
o	Promote agricultural recovery and private sector development (improvement of legal and regulatory framework, capacity building of associations and councils, development of SMEs, increased productivity, training, establishment of market linkages, etc.).  This will include but not be limited to:  income generation, employment, and improvement of livelihoods in local communities through community investment projects, public works, etc. and trade facilitation and promotion.

•	Provide expert analysis, advice, and policy recommendations to inform the USG about the operating context and International Financial Institutional processes, to guide policy making, and to ensure the USG perspective in donor dialogue.  Articulate the USG economic growth strategy and specific project goals to the Senior Management Team, senior U.S. Embassy officials, Washington colleagues, other donors, and the government, thereby building overall support.  

•	Supervise the selection process of new partners to ensure the quality and efficient implementation of USG funded initiatives and activities such as those described above.  This entails drafting scopes of work, leading selection panels, and managing program start-up.  Responsibilities may include serving as the Cognizant Technical Officer Representative for one or more projects.

•	Provide expertise and guidance as appropriate and necessary to senior government officials, including ministers, deputy ministers, permanent secretaries, parliamentarians, and governors, to shape the government’s broad-based economic growth program.  Respond to government requests for technical or project assistance in support of national goals.  Creativity is encouraged but sensitivity to political dynamics, including USG policy and legal restrictions, is necessary.  Interface with government may include consensus building on topics where there may be disagreement between Zimbabwean government officials; between the USG and Zimbabwean government officials; and/or between private sector actors and Zimbabwean government officials.  

•	As the USG’s leading economic development expert in Zimbabwe, promote and take the lead to foster more effective donor coordination fora, including within the Economic Technical Review Group of the World Bank-managed Multi-Donor Trust Fund.  Establish networks with other multilateral and bilateral donors to share information and promote USG programs.  

•	Provide insights, briefings, and outlines of USG-funded economic growth activities in Zimbabwe to high level delegations, including Congressional delegations, and, as appropriate and necessary, travel to Washington to promote USG interests with senior Agency officials, State Department colleagues, and members of Congress.

•	Identify reputable, influential, and dynamic private sector leaders and as appropriate gain their perspective on programming options, strategic direction, implementation, etc.     

•	Develop, supervise and oversee the preparation and maintenance of a comprehensive and effective management and results information system that will encompass all program monitoring and evaluation reports to track program effectiveness and comply with all USAID reporting requirements. 

•	Manage a process of staffing up a full EG Office, including identifying and highlighting necessary skills and roles and responsibilities for individual positions within the office.  Provide mentoring to new staff.

•      Perform other tasks, as requested by Mission management, and which are consistent with the advisory, managerial, and reporting requirements of the position of Senior Economics Advisor for USAID/Zimbabwe.

If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued UNRESTRICTED. NAICS code for this acquisition is 541850. Vendor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, tools, equipment and transportation required to provide the services described below. Vendor must submit pricing as follows:Pricing: 1 Job _____________________. All offerors should submit documentation for evaluation for award as described near the end of the synopsis-solicitation below. Contract performance is to be completed by 7/3/2009. STATEMENT OF WORK:GIS Veteran Population Data Analysis: The goals of this project with respect to the VENDOR is to assist the Veterans Affairs (VA)Western Region in analyzing their service area in terms of understanding the population dynamics from 1970 to 2007, the spatial distribution of veterans and veterans diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, the level of rurality, and the accessibility areas served by VA hospitals and community based health services. These goals will be accomplished through the following seven (7) tasks:Note: The spatial extent of analysis is the Veterans Affairs Western Region comprising of the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 for tasks 1,2,and 3. Tasks 4, 5, 6 and 7 will be for the entire United States. The analysis area will also include Philippines, Guam, American Samoa, and Saipan when data is readily available.1.  Census data is collected every 10 years using two different forms: 1) Short form which contains 100-percent data meaning the data is compiled from questions asked of every person and housing unit; and 2) Long form which contains data collected from approximately one in six households and weighted to represent total population. The VENDOR will collect and assemble a Census dataset for the 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 census, as well as, the 2007 Claritas census estimate.  In order to be able to analyze the data over multiple census collections, the data needs to be normalized. All census data sets will be normalized to the 2000 census tract boundaries to account for changes occurring in the census recording boundaries.2.  Using population census data (SF1:P1:Total population) from the short form census data, population trends will be identified on a decadal and overall time frame from 1970 to 2007. Areas of growth and decline will be identified at the census tract level to show the changing population densities of the VA Western Region.3. The Veteran population will be estimated using the census long form (SF3:P39:Sex by Age by Armed Forces Status by Veteran Status for the Population 18 Years and Over) data at the census tract level. This data will provide general estimates of the location and density of Veterans in the Western Region, as well as analysis of the Veteran population distribution by age and gender. In addition the data will be analyzed at the decadal and overall time frame (1970 to 2007) level to identify patterns in where Veterans are living.a. The Veteran population diagnosed with PTSD will be identified and mapped at an appropriate de-identified level. This data will be provided to the VENDOR by the VA in de-identified form.4.  The level of rurality will be determined using the USDA Rural-Urban Continuum (2003, 1993, 1983, 1974) and USDA County Typology codes (1974, 1983, 1989, 2004). These codes provide a measure of the level of development based upon the population, degree of urbanization, and proximity to metro areas at the county scale. The USDA historical data will be used to identify patterns in changes of rurality on a decadal and overall time frame. This analysis will be conducted at a national spatial extent.5. The location of all VA hospitals, clinics, and community based services (approx. 365) will be mapped by geocoding all the addresses provided for the service locations (found on the VISN websites) using the ESRI Streetmap USA street dataset. In addition the following data will also be geodoced:a. All VA facilities in the United States providing mental health services (approx.400) will be geocoded and identified. The VA will identify the facilities providing mental health services and provided this information to the VENDOR.b. Telehealth sites located within the Western Region (approx. 590) will begeocoded and identified. The VA will provide the VENDOR with the Telehealthfacility addresses in table format.c. Veteran Administration offices for the Western Region as listed on the VISN websites.d. Veteran Administration facilities and offices in the Philippines, Guam, American Samoa, and Saipan.6. To determine the service area of a particular location (ex. hospital) a network analysis will be performed using a time (ex. 30 minutes) variable to identify the extent of the service area. This analysis will be conducted using the geocoded service locations (task 5) and the ESRI Streetmap USA dataset available per state. This analysis will be run using 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, and 180 minutes as the time variable.a. Additional network analysis will be performed to identify service areas (based on travel time and distance) for patients with PTSD at a national level using the facilities identified (task 5a) as providing mental health services.7. The PTSD patient characteristics associated with service use, as identified through a VA run multiple regression, will be displayed together with rurality at a national level. The VA will provide the VENDOR with the patient characteristics for each zipcode at a national spatial extent.The deliverables will consist of a final report detailing the above stated analyses. Nine (9)formal maps illustrating the identified analyses results will be included in the final report. The report will be delivered in Adobe PDF format. In addition, ESRI ArcReader and ESRI ArcMap Projects can be provided along with any digital data created during the project.CONTRACT CLAUSES: FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Apr 2008);FAR 52.204-9 Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Sep 2007);FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items (Oct 2008).FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (Feb 2009) For the purposes of this clause, items (b) 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 33, and 37 and (c) 7 are considered checked and apply; FAR 52.224-1 Privacy Act Notification (Apr 1984); FAR 52.233-3 Protest after Award (Aug 1996); FAR 52.233-1 Disputes (July 2002); FAR 52.233-4 Applicable Law for Breach Of Contract Claim (Oct 2004);FAR 52.237-2 Protection of Government Building, Equipment, and Vegetation (Apr 1984);FAR 52.237-3 Continuity of Services (Jan 1991);FAR 52.249-1 Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed-Price) (Short Form) (Apr 1984);FAR 52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated By Reference (Feb 1998) For the purposes of this clause, the blanks are filled in as http://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html and http://www.va.gov/oamm/oa/ars/policyreg/vaar/index.cfm respectively: VAAR 852.203-70 Commercial Advertising (Jan 2008);VAAR 852.216-70 Estimated Quantities (Apr 1984);VAAR 852.237-70 Contractor Responsibilities (Apr 1984);VAAR 852.273-75 Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources (Interim - Oct 2008);VAAR 852.273-76 Electronic Invoice Submission (Interim - Oct 2008).SOLICITATION PROVISIONS:FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jun 2008);FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Feb 2009): Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision with its offer;FAR 52.216-1 Type of Contract (Apr 1984) For the purpose of this clause, the blank is filled in as Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Quantity.FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998) For the purpose of this provision, the blanks are filled in as http://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html and http://www.va.gov/oamm/oa/ars/policyreg/vaar/index.cfm respectively.VAAR 852.270-1 Representatives of Contracting Officers (Jan 2008);VAAR 852.273-70 Late Offers (Jan 2003); VAAR 852.273-74 Award Without Exchanges (Jan 2003).

<p>Solicitation provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award:<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by 52.212-2, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for the Louden Requirements. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>a. List factors and Subfactors:<br />The Government will evaluate for acceptability the factors described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Proposal <br />Factor 2- Cost/Price <br />Factor 3-Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology:<br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all offers. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Then, the offerors' past performance will be evaluated starting with the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Only those offerors determined to have an acceptable past performance rating, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Past performance evaluations will cease when the first two technically acceptable proposals receive an acceptable past performance rating for price comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor:<br />By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation technical requirements, to include the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, and will be determined technically acceptable. If the offeror is unable to meet the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, the offeror may set forth the delivery schedule the offeror is prepared to meet. However, should the offeror's proposed delivery schedule not meet the Required Delievery Schedule and should the Government determine such proposed delivery schedule to be unacceptable, the offeror will be determined UNACCEPTABLE. If the offeror's proposed delivery is determined acceptable, the solicitation will be amended and each offeror will be afforded an opportunity to revise their proposals. If the offeror does not propose a different delivery schedule, the Government's Required Delivery Schedule shall apply. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Each proposal will receive one of the ratings described below for Factor 1 - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Acceptable - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor:</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation: The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award).</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price: Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices plus other associated factors such as transportation costs if appropriate.</p>
<p>Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalance pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or subline items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor:<br />Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory where satisfactory equals a neutral or determination of responsibility, and unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution.</p>
<p>f. Discussions:<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions, therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />PRE-AWARD SURVEY<br /><br />The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offerors' capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>PLANT VISITS<br /><br />In the event discussions are necessary, plant visits may be conducted during the evaluation phase to develop knowledge for judging the potential for correction of deficiencies. <br /><br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>

<p>(c) (1) Streamlined compliance for commercial derivative military articles. As an alternative to the compliance required in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor may purchase an amount of domestically melted specialty metals in the required form, for use during the period of contract performance in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, In the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause if-<br />(i) This is an acquisition of commercial derivative military articles; and<br />(ii) The Contractor has certified in its offer in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) Certification for streamlined compliance for commercial derivative military articles (to be submitted with offer when applicable).

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. section 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. section 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC><p>The following questions were asked this morning.&nbsp; First the question then the answer.</p>
<p>Q1) My team advises that the tension of the cables will eventually warp the birch plywood panels. The panels need to be mounted with more secure fastening cleats instead of the hardware specified in the SOW.
<p>A1) The 3/4 panels will be sufficient. They will be secured to the walls and will not warp.</p>
<p>Q2) Auditorium, aluminum typography panels, will the blue acrylic be opaque or transparent? The transparent acrylic is more expensive.</p>
<p>A2) Transparent</p>
<p>Q3) Auditorium, my team advises that we use a more secure mounting system for the 12 large panels. Is that acceptable?</p>
<p>A3) We will need to be able to pull and move easily so pinch cleats (as in our original SOW and drawings) are appropriate.</p>
<p>Q4) Auditorium, back wall, please confirm that the cables will go from floor-to-ceiling. Also, can you please tell me the approximate height of the ceiling?</p>
<p>A4) Everything was specified in the drawings in the SOW.</p>
<p>Q5) Based on our site visit, we are bidding the project with "C" prints on all the back panels, rather than plain black. Is that appropriate?</p>
<p>A5) Where and what are they asking about? There are several areas.</p>
<p>Q6) Are we required to hang the envelopes at the time of installation? If so, will the AFB provide a layout? Additional days of installation will be required if there is no layout and the AFB opts to "art direct" placement of envelopes at the time of installation.</p>
<p>A6) They will be required to hang them. Even number on each side as specified in the drawings and SOW.</p>

As you can see on the website, the price for the most complete tool is $799.00. The next version is only $450.00. And then there is a free version.</span>&nbsp;<span>What version is required by the U.S. Secret Service?</span>&nbsp;<span>My assumption is that they would want the most capable version.&nbsp;</span> <span>Does the U.S. Secret Service own a KML converter tool?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The below was a question from a contractor to our customer requesting additional specification clarification:</p>
<p>1. Is there a specific brand or model size of excavator you are looking for, for example a cat 330 or 345? If so can we use a different machine with equivalent capabilities?</p>
<p><br />The CAT 330 or 345 (or equivalent) should work. Something comparable to the John Deere 350D LC would be good. It has a reach of approx 36 ft. But its 8 ton lift capacity reach is approx 20 ft. Its max dig depth is approx 24 ft. The machine will be placed in the creek bed by crane and will be digging down into the creek bed as well as into the side of the creek bank. The digging into the side of the bank could be up to approx 20 +/- ft above the creek bottom. Digging down below existing creek bottom could be approx 10+/- ft. Because the excavator will be placed by crane, if two excavators have similar capacity but different weight, we would prefer the lighter weight.</p>
<p>2. If you don't have a specific machine you are looking for we'll need more information on the lift capacities required. The RFQ asks for a machine that can lift 8 tons. Will that be over the front of the tracks or over the side? Also how high will the machine be required to lift 8 tons from ground level?</p>
<p>I would think one bucket with 2-3 CY capacity should work.</p>
<p>3. What size of bucket do you require, And if you need multiple buckets, and if you need a quick disconnect?</p>
<p>We would like a bucket WITH:</p>
<p>-Teeth</p>
<p>-Thumb combo (this requirement was with the original description - but not with the example I sent yesterday)</p>
<p>-A width of 48" to 60"</p>
<p>-2-3 CY capacity</p>
<p>4. What level of tier compliance does the machine require, if any?</p>
<p>The equip is subject to compliance with the California Air Resources Board and Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District which I believe would be Tier 2 or 3 depending on the hp or kw, date of manufacture, size of fleet, etc. Tier 4 compliance is coming in the future but not this year.</p>

1.       Each quantity requests a Magnum Light Generator, followed by a suffix: NGL, SON, AJO, TUS, and DGL.  A review of Magnums website indicates they have lite generators, but not any with the suffixs shown.
2.      The options/accessories listed for all:  electric winch, battery disconnect, lens guard, and anti glare visor are items that are used on light towers; not just a generator or light generator.  A review of Magnums light towers does not show that they have any with the listed suffixs.
3.      A review of Magnums GSA website does not show any specific model that relate to the listed suffixs.
 


ANSWER: I believe they are concerned with the abbreviations after each item.  (i.e., SON, TUS, DGL, etc.) 
 
These are our BP Station identifiers  not part numbers.  For example, SON means Sonoita BP Station, DGL means Douglas BP Station and so on.   It just indicates how many of each item each station has requested in their part of the bulk purchase.<BR><BR>The United States Border Patrol, Nogales, AZ Station requests the award of this sole source order in order to purchase the exact replacement generator/light towers, currently being utilized at the Nogales Station. Magnum generators are on GSA contract schedule to be distributed through Magnum Products LLC and/or their designated distributors.   This sole source proprietary procurement enables the US Border Patrol to maintain uniformity and consistency by obtaining exact replacement packages thus allowing for easy, low cost maintenance and installation.  The integrated package allows for greater flexibility among assets and manpower.  
This contract is expected to be filled by a sole source.  Justification is based on the unique technical characteristics.  Similar equipment would require considerable existing equipment modifications to meet the specific needs required by the Nogales Border Patrol Station.<BR><BR>

<p>Original Synopsis Below.</p>
<p>DARPA seeks innovative proposals that address the development of antenna coupled infrared detectors operating at room temperature and sensitive in the 3-5um spectral band, and the design and fabrication of large area, high density focal plane arrays (FPAs) based upon the antenna coupled detectors.  The program addresses technology to establish the feasibility of antenna coupled detectors with pixel linear dimension equal to the detected wavelength, 5 um; the interconnection of these small size devices to read-out integrated circuits; and imaging demonstrations with large area arrays, 2048x2048 elements.    The technology is based upon collecting infrared radiation with an antenna at each pixel, and coupling the infrared radiation into a semiconductor device with response at the frequency of the radiation.  The program integrates expertise in optical micro-antenna and high speed semiconductor technologies with the infrared detection and focal plane technologies, and the development of state of the art infrared imaging arrays.  The integration of these technologies results in an imaging array with unique attributes, establishing a new paradigm for infrared imaging.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to DARPA-BAA-09-48@darpa.mil.

<SUBJECT>Continuous, Non-Invasive Monitoring of Blood Pressure - Request for Information
<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-09-36
<RESPDATE>052209
<ARCHDATE>05232009
<CONTACT>Deepak Varshneya, Dr., Email CNIMBP@darpa.mil
<DESC>Continuous, Non-Invasive Monitoring of Blood Pressure – Request for information

Sponsor: Dr. Deepak Varshneya, Strategic Technology Office (STO), DARPA 

This request for information is to identify technical experts and concepts that will help DARPA ascertain the feasibility of pursuing a program to develop the capability to perform the continuous, non-invasive monitoring of blood pressure for battlefield triage and casualty transport.  To identify these experts/concepts, DARPA is requesting the submission of abstracts in response to the discussion below.  Depending on the quality and the scope of the abstracts received, DARPA may choose to hold a workshop to further assess the feasibility and value of developing a DARPA program.  

The need for non-invasive and continuous monitoring of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) is pervasive across all medical environments, but most especially on military battlefield where rapid triage, stabilization and evacuation are critical to the survival of the wounded. Unfortunately, truly continuous monitoring of BP can only be done invasively, a procedure that is difficult to accomplish on the front lines. “Semi-continuous” approaches rely on automatic measurements using a cuff, which are difficult or, depending on the wound, sometimes impossible to use in the battlefield environment. Existing non-invasive approaches also often interfere with other critical medical procedures. Thus, there is an urgent medical need for continuous monitoring of BP that is non-invasive and flexible enough to be implemented regardless of the injury. 

Although such a capability does not exist, the increased emphasis in home health care has led to a large body of research and many fielded devices focused on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, which begins to address the needs on the battlefield. The most “non-invasive” devices (e.g., BMEYE, Portapres®, etc.) use finger cuffs coupled with sophisticated algorithms to account for motion and other factors that interfere with the measurement. There is also a body of research using devices based on photo-plethysmographic like sensors that measure the pressure pulse as it moves from one location to another through changes in diameter of the blood vessels. (for example, see “Mobile Monitoring with Wearable Photo-plethysmographic Biosensors,” EEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine May/June 2003 H. Harry Asada, Phillip Shaltis, Andrew Reisner, Sokwoo Rhee, and Reginald C. Hutchinson).

However, the devices and research described above fall short of the Warfighter’s needs on the battlefield in several important ways. First, these devices will generally require measurements to be made on the finger where cuffs are non-obtrusive and optical measurements can be easily made. Unfortunately, in the battlefield environment, one cannot assume access to any particular part of the body. In addition, each of these approaches requires calibration and/or a careful medical attention (e.g., correctly sized finger cuff) to ensure accurate measurements. Again, such luxuries are not necessarily available to the medic in the battlefield. Thus, while these efforts provide optimism that this difficult problem may be tractable, DARPA believes that more fundamental, multidisciplinary effort is required.  Clearly, a key to solving this problem is to develop a detailed understanding of the physiological signatures associated with blood flowing through the body and to relate those signatures to an absolute pressure or mean arterial pressure (MAP). For example, the dynamic measurement of blood flow rate combined with knowing the temporal changes in blood vessel dimensions could allow calculations of pressure using fluid dynamic models. Making these measurements might require optical imaging and developing mechanical models of arterial wall dynamics. 

It is likely many other signatures and associated sensors could be uncovered if interdisciplinary teams with the following disciplines/technical expertise were brought to bear. 
•	Medical experience on the military battlefield and/or civilian emergency and hospital setting.
•	Understanding and modeling of the possible signatures from all modalities (optical, acoustic, RF, mechanical, etc.) that may be relatable to blood pressure.
•	Expertise in developing sensors that can measure signatures from across the complete spectrum of modalities.
•	Experience in implementing medical devices and measurements. 
•	Mathematics and signal processing.

The purpose of this RFI it to identify technologies from across multiple disciplines to identify areas that would be promising to pursue in a possible DARPA program to develop a continuous, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring system. 

Abstract Submission:
DARPA  requests a one-page abstract that highlights the experience and/or expertise that the submitter feels can contribute to the problem of continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring. Abstracts should be related to one or more of the disciplines/expertise described above. Abstracts that do not address the focus of this RFI and/or lack technical content will be reviewed. Because of the possibility that abstracts will be presented in an open forum, they should not include proprietary information.  Abstracts may be by multiple authors, but a primary author must be identified.  To be considered, abstracts must be submitted by 22 May 2009 to the following email address:  CNIMBP@darpa.mil.  Additional information can be found on the following web site www.sa-meetings.com/CNIMBP2009.

Workshop
Based on the quality and scope of the abstracts received, DARPA may choose to hold a workshop to provide an opportunity for the interdisciplinary community to interact with DARPA and other interested DOD agencies.  This workshop will be by invitation only  - with invitations based primarily on the relevance of the technologies in the the submitted abstracts.  Some of those invited may be asked to provide a short presentation based on their abstract.  In the case of oversubscription, invitations may be limited to the primary author of an abstract.  No proprietary information should be presented at this workshop.  Information about how to follow-up to DARPA with proprietary information will be presented during the workshop.

For planning purposes, a tentative date of 23-25 June 2009 in San Diego is being held in anticipation of holding the workshop.  However, DARPA has not yet committed to this workshop and reserves the right to not hold any workshop or change its date and/or location.  Response to the RFI is strictly voluntary.  This RFI does not commit DARPA to be responsible for any cost associated in the generation of the abstracts or any subsequent costs associated with any attendance at the workshop by any individuals.  This RFI does not commit DARPA in any way to the development of a program in this area. 

Modification 1 to DARPA-SN-09-36 is issued to reflect a change to the abstract submittal date to 22 May 2009.

<SUBJECT>Mediation, Training, Counseling , Final Agency Decisions, and Investigation Services to Support BBG’s Office of Civil Rights 
<SOLNBR>BBG-OCR-CY09-7806
<CONTACT>Gary C Hosford, Supervisory Contracting Officer, Phone 202.382.7843, Fax 202-382.7854, Email ghosford@bbg.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is seeking qualified "small business sources"&nbsp;to provide EEO Counseling, Training, Investigation, Final Agency Decisions, and Mediation Services to support its Washington, DC and Miami, FL offices on a contract basis. The Agency intends to issue one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to qualified small business vendors. The following general information pertains to all of the above-listed services: (1) Assignments are performed on a contract basis; (2) Most assignments require working in Washington, DC; however, some assignments may require working in Miami, FL or short duration travel to other domestic locations; (3) Contractor personnel may be required to undergo a background security investigation and successfully pass the security clearance process in order to receive a BPA; (4) Contractor personnel will work on an "as-required" basis, depending upon the OCR's needs; (5) Free-lance assignments are contracted for strictly on an "as needed" basis, consequently, the BBG/OCR makes no guarantees on the amount of work assignments that contractors can expect to receive; and (6) The Government is obligated to inspect all contractors' performed work to ensure that it fully satisfies the Government's requirements. The Government is further obligated to reject all work that fails to meet Government-specified requirements.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span>: The BBG will not reimburse costs associated with "Local Travel" to/from the Contractor's office to/from BBG Headquarters. Neither will the BBG reimburse the Contractor for personnel "travel time". However, the BBG will reimburse the Contractor for costs associated with travel to/from the Contractor's office to/from other BBG facilities (e.g., Miami, FL). Reimbursement will be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR). The following criteria, depending on the type of services being contracted (i.e., EEO Counseling, Training, Investigation, Final Agency Decisions, and Mediation services), will be used as appropriate by BBG/OCR to evaluate prospective contractors: (1) Past experience in performing the work listed above; (2) Education; (3) Technical approach to research, analyze, and prepare material; and (4) evidence of oral and written skills (the OCR may request writing samples). Prospective contractors are hereby notified that the basis for award will be based on best value, with technical evaluation factors (i.e., strength of prospective contractor's experience, resume, approach, and oral/written skills) being more important than the prospective contractor's proposed hourly price. Offerors shall also submit a price proposal that includes their fully burdened (i.e., inclusive of overhead &amp; profit) hourly rate. All "small business sources" who believe that they have the experience and capabilities to perform one or more of the above-stated services to be procured under a contract basis from BBG may submit written inquiries for additional information and/or submit their written statement (i.e., technical and price data) to Mr. Michael D. Hill, BBG/ Office of Civil Rights, Switzer Building, Suite 4004, 330 "C" Street, SW, Washington, DC 20237 (e-mail address for inquiries only: mdhill@bbg.gov) at any time. Capabilities Statements shall be submitted via hard copy only; telegraphic submissions, facsimile submissions, or proposals submitted via electronic means (e.g., e-mail) will not be considered. This Notice is not a RFQ, RFP, or IFB.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) program is conducting an analysis of image generators to determine if we should 1) continue delivering CFFT systems with the current image generators, 2) if we should integrate a new image generator into the CFFT systems that have not been delivered, or 3) if we should purchase new image generators for all CFFT systems.  The analysis will focus on 1) the capabilities of the image generator today, 2) what functionality would need to be developed to meet the program requirements, and 3) cost.  The result of the analysis will be a decision on which approach to take with the CFFT image generators and which products would best meet the requirements of the CFFT program.  If it is decided to integrate new image generators into the CFFT systems, the integration would start in October/November 2009.<BR><BR>The total number of CFFT systems to be delivered is approximately 405.  Of the 405 total systems, approximately 155 systems have been delivered to date.  These systems are delivered in 1-to-4, 1-to-12, and 1-to-30 (instructor-to-student) configurations.  The 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 configurations require 3 image generators.  The 1-to-30 configurations require 4 image generators.  <BR><BR>For the 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 configurations, an image generator is required for the enhanced student station which provides Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR) and Night Vision Goggles (NVG) views; a second image generator for the Stealth system at the Instructor Operators Station; and the third image generator for the rendered real-world scene projected on a classroom screen.  The 1-to-30 configuration has an additional image generator for additional field-of-view on the classroom screen to accommodate the larger student number.<BR><BR>The key parameters that will determine the approach the program takes are the following:<BR>"	Low cost visual system<BR>"	Reduce Life Cycle cost<BR>"	Leverage SE CORE database generation and models<BR>"	Compliance to the JFPL Standards<BR>"	Integration schedule compliance<BR><BR><BR>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates that the program requirement will be fulfilled via a delivery order under PEO STRIs STOC II contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.505.  The Government will make the award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  <BR><BR>The contract type has not been determined at this time.<BR><BR>QUANTITIES: There will be 33 1-to-30 configurations delivered; the remaining systems will be 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 for a maximum total of 1,248 Image Generators.<BR><BR>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: Maximum of $12M<BR><BR>RESPONSES REQUIRED: STOC II contractors desiring to be considered for this opportunity must respond by the closing date above to the contract specialist listed below.  The Government reserves the right to eliminate STOC II contractors that fail to respond by the closing date above from further consideration for potential award.  <BR> <BR>Written responses to this announcement should consist of the following:<BR><BR>a.	Completed Vendor IG Response Table. (Attachment A below)<BR>b.	A statement as to whether the firm has the resource capacity to produce and deliver the image generator quantities through fiscal year 2015.<BR><BR>The response is limited to paragraphs a-b above and should not exceed six (6) pages.  Any additional information will be discarded without review.   The information provided needs to define the current functionality/capabilities of the product that you would recommend to this program.  At this time no cost information is being requested.

ORGANIZATION & BACKGROUNDThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Chief Benefits Office, FeeProgram (Purchased Care for Veterans) is a program that provides fornon-VA care for eligible veterans including those not able to access VAhealth care facilities based on geographic constraints or due to medicalemergencies, or it is economically advantageous to provide treatment inthe community.   Effective July 19, 2001, the VA is authorized to utilize variousMedicare claims pricing schedules in the processing of payment orreimbursement for fee basis non-service connected emergency care (USCode: Title 38, 1725 - Reimbursement for emergency treatment) approvedunder the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999(Section 111 of Public Law 106-117) (Mill Bill).  This speciallegislation authorized the Secretary to determine the appropriatereimbursement for these services. To learn more about the Fee Program access http://www.nonvacare.va.gov/
CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAll claims pricing done by the VA systems described below may be sent tore-pricing agent to see if they can provide a better price for theservice. Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)The pricing transactions for IPPS are created by VistA (The VeteransHealth Information Systems and Technology Architecture) system usingeither data previously entered into VistA Fee (from Fee Basis Invoicefile) or data entered electronically by a user and are processed usingMedicare Code Editor (3M product), MS-DRG Grouper (CMS product - Centersfor Medicare and Medicaid Services), PPS Pricer (CMS product), and COBOLinterface programs (developed in-house) on z/OS Enterprise Server.  ThePricer reports and Reject reports are transmitted to each station (over170 VA Medical Centers located nation-wide) three times a day.  Thecurrent system can process transactions using proper schedules/versionsas old as fiscal year 1998.  All pricing results are saved in FeeHistory file and available for audit purposes.
Outpatient and Inpatient AncillaryThe VistA Fee Basis software has two built-in schedules for pricingoutpatient and inpatient ancillary claims.  It contains the MedicarePhysician Fee schedule (RBRVS) and the VA Fee schedule (75thpercentile).  If the service is provided under an existing vendorcontract, then the VA pays the contracted amount.

ORGANIZATION & BACKGROUNDThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Chief Benefits Office, FeeProgram (Purchased Care for Veterans) is a program that provides fornon-VA care for eligible veterans including those not able to access VAhealth care facilities based on geographic constraints or due to medicalemergencies, or it is economically advantageous to provide treatment inthe community.   Effective July 19, 2001, the VA is authorized to utilize variousMedicare claims pricing schedules in the processing of payment orreimbursement for fee basis non-service connected emergency care (USCode: Title 38, 1725 - Reimbursement for emergency treatment) approvedunder the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999(Section 111 of Public Law 106-117) (Mill Bill).  This speciallegislation authorized the Secretary to determine the appropriatereimbursement for these services. To learn more about the Fee Program access http://www.nonvacare.va.gov/
CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAll claims pricing done by the VA systems described below may be sent tore-pricing agent to see if they can provide a better price for theservice. Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)The pricing transactions for IPPS are created by VistA (The VeteransHealth Information Systems and Technology Architecture) system usingeither data previously entered into VistA Fee (from Fee Basis Invoicefile) or data entered electronically by a user and are processed usingMedicare Code Editor (3M product), MS-DRG Grouper (CMS product - Centersfor Medicare and Medicaid Services), PPS Pricer (CMS product), and COBOLinterface programs (developed in-house) on z/OS Enterprise Server.  ThePricer reports and Reject reports are transmitted to each station (over170 VA Medical Centers located nation-wide) three times a day.  Thecurrent system can process transactions using proper schedules/versionsas old as fiscal year 1998.  All pricing results are saved in FeeHistory file and available for audit purposes.
Outpatient and Inpatient AncillaryThe VistA Fee Basis software has two built-in schedules for pricingoutpatient and inpatient ancillary claims.  It contains the MedicarePhysician Fee schedule (RBRVS) and the VA Fee schedule (75thpercentile).  If the service is provided under an existing vendorcontract, then the VA pays the contracted amount.  If it is not providedunder a current contract and is subject to the Medicare Physician Feeschedule (RBRVS), then the amount from that schedule is paid.  If it isnot subject to RBRVS, the VA Fee schedule is used assuming there was anamount calculated for the fiscal year for that service on that schedule.There are exceptions; i.e., Dental services are paid using a differentschedule and Mill Bill (emergency care) is paid at 70% of the applicableMedicare schedule.
OthersDesktop applications - either CMS PC Pricers or Excel worksheets basedon Medicare Fee schedules that are downloadable from CMS are used atsome sites.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS5-12-09
Question 1:  Could the vendor propose a centralized system located atthe vendor site (accessible through a web-based interface) to providethese pricing services?
Answer 1:  No.  The central location is Corporate Data CenterOperations, Information Technology Center in Austin, Texas.   
Question 2:  Please provide information regarding VA security standardsor where they can be accessed on the Web.
Answer 2:  http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/   ->  Search for 6500
Question 3:  The ability to "easily integrate with other applications"is highly dependent upon the integration methods allowed by thoseapplications.  Can interfaces be supplied via an industry standard webservices model?
Answer 3:  The interface method is not critical as long as it is anindustry standard and it can be easily modified at the front and backend to meet the needs.  We are open to ideas and possibilities;therefore, send in the best possible solutions. Here are examples of the possible need for interface: 
1. Not all data may be typed in using a web-based user-interface.  Somedata may be scanned in.  Some sites with heavy volume may scan-in theclaims data.  Some patient information may need to come from existingdatabases (MUMPS or other standard databases).
2.  Pricing results may need to be saved in sequential file format or ina database for audit purposes or for further processing by any otherreporting applications (not known at this time) besides reportsgenerated by the proposed system. 
Question 4:  Would the VA CAI entertain an approach that would providefor some of these pricing services in a "batch mode" only?
Answer 4:  Yes.  If 'batch mode' is the only possible method by yoursolution, send it in.  We are exploring all possibilities.
Question 5:  Item #24 - States that the VA CAI has requested the"ability to customize the interface".  Does this mean that the VA CAIintends to alter the web-based interface?  
Answer 5:  May be.  Besides the customizing covered in #3, the userinterface may need to be customized to show or hide certain data items.The interface may need to be customized if the proposed system does notallow critical data elements. The customizing may be done as a part ofthe new solution by your company.  Open for the best solution. 
Question 6:  Would it be acceptable to simply supply VA CAI with webservices and allow the VA CAI to develop/interface with VA CAI web-basedapplications?
Answer 6:  Seeking currently developed web-applications; not possiblefuture developments.  Minor adjustments are expected.
Question 7:  Can the VA provide more detail regarding specific outputand/or systems features they would anticipate customizing?
Answer 7:  Input customization is to allow different types of data entryas explained in #3.   Besides the possible customization for storingpricing results and the related data (stated in #3), One example is todisplay or hide certain types of data on the reports; and anotherexample is to add possible VA surcharge to the total payment amount.

Question 8:  Item #42 - States that the VA CAI has requested the vendor"provide technical support for installation, acceptance testing, andproblems that may arise in the production environment."  Is itacceptable to propose a model that provides the system at a vendor site?This would eliminate this added cost.
Answer 8:  The new system will be located at Information TechnologyCenter in Austin, Texas as stated in #1.  
Question 9:  What provider identifier will be used to uniquely identifythe provider rendering the care for pricing?  
Answer 9:  The six digit Medicare provider ID is used.  The first twodigits identify the state, territory or country where the facility islocated. The remaining four digits identify the type of facility orunit.  The provider information is provided by CMS.  Not all casesrequire provider ID; some may use locality.
Question 10:  In addition to producing and storing actual pricinginformation what other data storage and reporting needs would berequired?  
Answer 10:   The storage solution is necessary for storing input/outputdata for at least 10 years.  It is important that input/output data canbe stored in some logical method for possible in-house reportapplications or any other future systems that may utilize the data.  Thestorage requirements are not critical for the purpose of this RFI atthis time since it can be expanded in the future.  Send in any availablesolutions.  
Question 11:  Will the VA need direct data access to perform ad-hocqueries?
Answer 11:  Yes.  The pricing results and the related input and indexvalues need to be stored on site and available for queries.
Question 12:  Would the VA need the individual components that were usedby our pricing solution in addition to the total price?
Answer 12:  Yes. Most of the values that are used in the main formulafor calculating the total payment need to be shown on the report.  Forexample, an Inpatient PPS pricing report may show amounts for IndirectTeaching Adjustments, Hospital Specific Amount, Federal Specific Amount,Outlier amount, and main index values, etc.  Show us available dataelements on your current reports generated by your pricing solutions,and tell us any possible adjustments.  In addition, in case of anyerror, it needs to provide the reason for the error.
Question 13:  Under the "purpose" section of the RFI, the intent of theinquiry is to seek products or systems that are available to "...applythe following Medicare Payment Schedules and Pricing Systems...." Is theVA's intent in the solution to return a base fee, or to determineREIMBURSEMENT via Medicare pricing regulation, such as multi-procedurediscounting, specialty reduction, and multi-channel lab code bundlingetc.?
Answer 13:  To determine the reimbursement amount using the CMSregulations.
Question 14:  Can the VA confirm if this RFI is specific to a solutionto offer a Medicare Pricing solution, without exception, i.e., noproprietary fee schedules?  
Answer 14:  VA will follow CMS regulations and schedules.
Question 15:  How would the VA propose to price claims for which thereis not an established CMS allowable?
Answer 15:  Current VA payment methodology will be used.  
Question 16:  Please confirm that the proposed solution will be usedsolely for the pricing of individual claims, i.e., the vendor is notrequired to perform claims processing activities such as duplicatechecking, etc.
Answer 16:  The system will only be used for pricing individual claims.
Question 17:  Is the VA expecting that the proposed solution houseeither a Provider File or Member File?
Answer 17:  All necessary reference files such as provider file need tobe updated as the updates are made available by CMS.  The proposedsolution will not house either Provider file or Member file (assumption:the provider file means the provider specific file provided by CMS).
Question 18:  How does the VA envision pricing services for which thereis not a CMS established price?
Answer 18:  See the response for the question #15.
Question 19:  Item # 21 states that the proposed solution should provide"Easy integration with other applications (ex, the pricing results maybe used by other applications.)." Can the VA describe the "otherapplications?"
Answer 19:  The "other applications" are not known at this time.  We areopen to all possibilities.  It may be future mainframe development,reporting applications, Oracle applications, or an existing system suchas the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture(VistA).
Question 20:  Item #25 states that the proposed solution should providethe "Ability to archive the pricing results and the original input data(for both batch and one-line use) which may be used by otherapplications." Can the VA describe the "other applications?"
Answer 20:  See the response for the question #19.

<AWARDEE>Johnson, Bassin & Shaw Inc., 5515 Security Ln
, North Bethesda, MD 20852-5007 US
<DESC>This contract is to support The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), Children’s Bureau (CB) which requires technical and logistical support for Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSR) and Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews (IV-E FCER).  Additionally, the Children’s Bureau requires support for the State Team Training Project (STTP) which is a component of the Child Welfare Reviews Project (CWRP).

Child and Family Services Reviews:

The Department of Health and Human Services, through the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Children’s Bureau (CB) is responsible for reviewing State agencies’ child welfare programs and services on a periodic basis.  States are required to submit a self-evaluative Statewide Assessment to the CB prior to the States’ Child and Family Services Review (CFSR).

The CFSRs are designed to examine the outcomes of services provided to children and families, as well as, systemic factors that affect the ability of State agencies to achieve positive outcomes for children and families.  The CFSRs cover a wide range of federally funded child welfare programs and services, including child protective services, foster care, adoption, family preservation/family support and independent living services.

The overall goal of the CFSRs is to assist States in improving child welfare services and the outcomes for families and children who receive the services by identifying the strengths and needs within State programs and those areas where technical assistance could lead to program improvements.  Other purposes of the review strategy include the following:

•	Linking the CFSRs to existing Children’s Bureau Regional Office and States joint planning, technical assistance and program improvement processes;
	
•	Assisting States in becoming more self-evaluating over time;
	
•	Ensuring that Federal funds are spent in accordance with Federal statute, regulation and policy;

•	Collecting data that will inform national policy;
	
•	Identifying best practices that can be emulated across the country;
	
•	Identifying State training and technical assistance needs and providing access to assistance needed to implement a program improvement plan (PIP); and
	
•	Providing timely and specific feedback to States that is directly related to program performance and outcomes.

Outcomes are assessed for each State through a Statewide Assessment and an onsite review process.  The outcomes and goals are as follows:


Safety Outcome 1: Children are, first and foremost, protected from abuse and neglect.
	
Safety Outcome 2: Children are safely maintained in their homes whenever possible and appropriate.

Permanency Outcome 1: Children have permanency and stability in their living situations.

Permanency Outcome 2: The continuity of family relationships and connection is preserved for children.

Well-Being Outcome 1: Families have enhanced capacity to provide for their children’s needs.

Well-Being Outcome 2: Children receive appropriate services to meet their educational needs.

Well-Being Outcome 3: Children receive adequate services to meet their physical and mental/behavioral health needs.

A CFSR team will be assigned to each State and consist of individuals representing the Children’s Bureau Central and Regional Offices, the State agency under review, various State stakeholders from the State being reviewed and cross-State participants, including up to 30 non-Federal consultant reviewers.  The consultant reviewers chosen for each review will be national child welfare professionals and experts.  

For the purpose of this contract, the Contractor will be responsible for managing
the travel and hotel logistics of the consultant reviewers.  


A National pool of approximately 500 non-Federal consultant reviewers will be required for each round of reviews. Consultant reviewers will be recruited from, and travel within and across the ten Federal Regions.


The basic steps of the CFSR process are as follows:

1.	Determine the dates for the review;
2.	Form the review team;
3.	Conduct planning conference calls;
4.	Transmit data profiles selected from AFCARS and NCANDS, to the State;
5.	Complete Statewide Assessment (by the State);
6.	Designate sites for the onsite review activities;
7.	Select the sample and types of cases to be reviewed onsite;
8.	Prepare and disseminate the Preliminary Assessment;
9.	Prepare for the onsite review (all review related preparation);
10.                Conduct onsite review;
11.                Complete and issue the Final Report;
12.                Develop and approve PIP, as necessary;
13.                Implement and monitor PIP;
14.                Withhold Federal funds for nonconformity;
15.                Conduct subsequent reviews.
	
These steps are to be accomplished through the collaboration of the Children’s Bureau Central and Regional Office Staff, and Contractor.  Examples of key roles and responsibilities for each are:

Children’s Bureau Central Office

				
•	Provides leadership on CFSRs;

•	Administers the title IV-E and title IV-B Programs; 
	
•	Provides guidelines to the Regions;
	
•	Ensures collaboration between the Contractor, Regions, and review team; and
	
•	Manages the technical components of all principle projects related to the contract.

Children’s Bureau Regional Office

•	Provides co-leadership of the CFSRs;
	
•	Serves as liaison with State leadership and CB representatives in planning review activities;
	
•	Ensures that the Statewide Assessment and accompanying data are sent to the State on a timely basis and returned back in time to plan the onsite review;

•	Coordinates the development, revision, circulation and release of the Preliminary Assessment and Final Report; and

•	Works with State’s PIP Development Team, the CB Central Office staff, and the National Resource Centers toward the development and approval of the PIP.

•	Monitors implementation and progress of PIP’s for States within its region.

Contractor

•	Arranges logistics for Federal staff, consultant reviewers and cross-State participants;
	
•	Ensures that a review planning package of all documents needed for the review, including instruments, CFSR Procedures Manual, handouts, instructions and other related materials are available and delivered to the State for review planning conference calls and the onsite review;

•	Archives all CFSR related documents for easy access by the Children’s Bureau Central and Regional Office staff;

•	Processes reimbursements for non-Federal Review Team members;
	
•	Serves as liaison with Children’s Bureau Central and Regional Office staff and Review Team members, including cross-State participants who may attend training sessions;
	
•	Updates and maintains a comprehensive database to  track all planned and completed reviews including profiles of all former and current review teams members as well as potential consultant reviewers;
	
•	Expands the existing database to track PIP actions and milestones; 
	
•	Prepares and submits monthly and annual reports to the Children’s Bureau Central and Regional offices summarizing national monitoring activities; 

•	Plans, coordinates, and conducts Regional trainings for new consultant reviewers and cross-State participants in collaboration and consultation with CB Central and Regional Office staff; 

•	Designs and conducts training for consultant reviewers selected to serve as Co-Local Site Leaders

•	Provides additional program support to the project, as needed, through qualified subcontractors with child welfare expertise.

•	Tracks CFSR penalties for nonconformity, and title IV-E disallowances for noncompliance; 

The Contractor will continue to perform the core tasks listed in the following Scope of 
Work during the entire life of the contract, unless an agreement between the
Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), key CB Central Office staff 
and the Contracting Officer is made to make contract modifications. 

State Team Training Project of the Child and Family Services Reviews:

The State Team Training Project (STTP) is a component of the Child Welfare Reviews Project (CWRP).  The project was created to provide program and logistical support and periodic training of non-Federal consultant reviewers who assist in the Child and Family Services Reviews.  The project will assist State child welfare agencies to enhance
their knowledge of the CFSR process and improve program performance and outcomes.

The contractor shall develop curricula that will train State child welfare agencies to prepare for the CFSR process.  Specifically, the contractor will develop training components as outlined in Task 3.

In addition, the contractor will provide training to States on the CFSR process and the automation of the review instruments through group instruction, as well as, through the development of an electronic training platform (e-training).

Once the Children’s Bureau has approved the curriculum the contractor will provide the training to each of the States scheduled for a CFSR.  Within a four-year period all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico will undergo a CFSR.  The specific number of reviews per years may vary and is subject to change.  

The Children’s Bureau estimates that approximately 60 participants will attend each State training, as follows:

•	38 State staff and representatives
•	4 co-leaders
•	5 Cross State Participants
•	Alternates as needed(up to 5)
•	Remaining slots for extra cross state participants and others approved for training
•	3 children’s Bureau Regional Office staff
•	1 Children’s Bureau Central Office staff person 

Approximately 3 Federal Regional Office staff and 1 Federal Central Office staff will participate in each training session as attendees to receive and discuss updated information. 

The contract is awarded on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  The determination was based on the uncertainties involved with contract performance which would not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.

<DESC>Bridge Action for the Air Vehicle Engineering Department (AIR 4.3) and the Manned Flight Simulator / Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facilities (AIR 5.4)  located at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Patuxtent River, MD.

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Science Applications International Corp.(SAIC), to extend the performance period of the existing contract (N00421-04-C-0013) until December 31, 2009. This effort will involve a maximum of 19 man years of Engineering and Technical Services. These man years are currently available on the existing contract. 

Note: A sources sought synopsis has been issued in preparation for issuing a competitive solicitation (N68335-09-R-0215)  to provide these services in the future.

The Government intends to procure the above services under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. (2) (iii), as a bridge action between the existing contract and the follow-on competitive acquisition, in order to provide continuity of services. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling Government requirements. Reference note 22. The technical and engineering services are currently provided by SAIC on contract N00421-04-C-0013. The Period of Performance for this contract was set to end on June 19, 2009 and shall be extended to December 31, 2009 by this action. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing that may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to open the requirement to competition based on the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice.
