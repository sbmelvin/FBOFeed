<DESC>The Military Sealift Command (MSC) operates four (4) T-AOE 6 Class ships with a primary mission of providing logistical support to the US Navy’s fleet.  MSC intends to upgrade these ships’ Replenishment at Sea (RAS) system to a new Heavy Replenishment at Sea (HRAS) system.  The upgrade will take place in phases over an extended period of multiple years.  The purpose of the anticipated contract will be to create detailed engineering work packages to include all needed drawings, develop shipyard installation cost estimates, and document as built configurations.  The work packages will be used to develop shipyard procurement packages that support the installation of HRAS components on a schedule that includes one complete operating station and one backbone installation on the first vessel, followed by two backbone installations on the second ship. This will be followed by two full HRAS stations on the third ship and fourth ship followed by completing the installation on the first two ships that received backbone installations.  As built configuration drawings and documentation will be required for the first and third ships.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends to award a call/task order against the competitively awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for GCDB and Land Records Services to procure services for GPS Corner Collection in Idaho.  The BPA being utilized is L10PA00578, and was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.   The BPA was competed amongst GSA contract holders and Premier Data Services proved to provide the best value to the government.  This opportunity is only available to the current BPA contract holder.  This notice is not a solicitation for offers.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  Below is a general description of the services required.
This task will involve collecting geographic coordinates on approximately 340 PLSS corners of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) across 130 ARRA townships.  The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey, title, and legal land description information to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and title information in support of parcel based display of geographic information.  The Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) is the digital portrayal of the PLSS and is assembled in a series of working ascii files and a geo-database for publication.  This task order is to improve the accuracy of the depiction of the PLSS within GCDB.
Remonumentation of government corner positions is not allowed under this award.  Monuments shall be described as found and not rehabilitated.  The contractor will not use accessories to establish a corner position, but accessories may be used to verify that a monument is in the position of record.
Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing by email to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov.

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, as authorized by 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), the US Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), intends to make sole source awards to multiple contractors currently providing support services to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formally the Food Stamp Program, by conducting Nationwide on-site store visits. The objective of the SNAP store visits is to supplement FNS's ability to visit retail stores that are applying or licensed to accept SNAP benefits for the purpose of confirming that the stores are eligible to participate according to law and regulations, i.e., that the stores are in business of selling an ample variety of staple food for home preparation and consumption. The Government has made the determination that these services are critical to the success of the Program and continuity must be maintained pending a new contract award within 3 months. The current contracts do not permit automatic extensions for supporting transition from the current contractors to the new contractor. This transition is critical to the successful continuation of SNAP store visits under the new contract and thus requires transition from the current contractors to the new contractor.
<p>This is a Class Notice for proposed awards to the following vendors with current contracts for different Regional locations: Greet America, Tech Law, Delta 21 and First Venture in the total estimated amount of $ 900,000 for a period of 3 months to maintain continuity of services during the transition phase to a new contractor. The extensions will be at the same terms and conditions as stipulated in the current contracts. Interested vendors must have Nation-wide or capabilities in FNS regions, meet all contract requirements, be able to interface electronically with FNS Systems to receive call orders electronically for conducting store visits on the 1st day of the contract awards and start work immediately. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Comments on this notice must be in writing no later than 3:00PM on Monday the 29th of March, 2010 and may be faxed to the attention of Sheryl Sanders at 703-305-2071 or email to Sheryl.Sanders@fns.usda.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contracts is based upon Government's determination that the transition support from the current contractors to the new contractor is critical to the successful continuation of SNAP store visit program.</p>

<CONTACT>Keith Bubar, Phone 3019758329, Email keith.bubar@nist.gov
<DESC>Background: The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Retrieval Group (Information Access Division/Information Technology Laboratory) runs large-scale evaluations of information retrieval systems such as document retrieval, question answering, and summarization systems.
<p>The work of the NIST Information Technology Laboratory, Information Access Division Retrieval Group includes a set of projects whose purpose is to foster the development of computer systems that are able to analyze and manipulate the information content of artifacts originally constructed for consumption by humans.</p>
<p>The artifacts of interest include video/image data such as produced television shows, the raw footage from which a final show is drawn, and consumer-generated video. The artifacts can be manipulated in a variety of ways, each of which defines a task for a computer system: find related artifacts; extract specific facts from artifacts; summarize a set of artifacts; find artifacts that express a given opinion, or discuss a given event or person; etc. The projects conducted by the NIST Retrieval Group strive to extend this paradigm to the evaluation of systems that use multimedia queries to research large collections of digital video.<br /><br />The end result of this particular project is to use the information gathered from the results to modify, test or improve existing search engines and also to develop new state of the art search engines. Also, this information shall be shared with universities around the USA that are developing new ways to search for data on the web. This project is part of the NIST mission of "promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement in science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life". With this project NIST strives to advance the existing technology and to help create new technologies that help to improve our way of life. <br /><br />Scope of this Acquisition: This presolicitation notice is for a noncommercial services acquisition in the area of video search systems testing through the use of video queries and assessments. NIST intends to solicit this acquisition under the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (which are for acquisitions valued up to $100,000). NIST also intends to compete this acquisition as a Total Small Business Set Aside under the NAICS code 541990, with a small business size standard of $7.0 million. The period of performance is anticipated to be less than one year. The Government intends to utilize the&nbsp;Labor Hour&nbsp;contract type for these services because it is feasible for the Government to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with a reasonable degree of confidence.<br /><br />Availability of Solicitation: NIST intends to post the solicitation on www.fbo.gov on or about 16 days after this notice is posted. The first amendment to this notice was&nbsp;posted on March 27, 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;NIST intends to post the solicitation on <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> five days from this date.&nbsp;Quotations will be due no later than 10 days after the solicitation is posted on www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Requirement for Active Registration in CCR: Each Offeror must have an active registration at www.ccr.gov to be eligible to receive an award under this acquisition.</p>
<p>All questions regarding this acquisition shall be directed by email to the primary point of contact: Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov.</p>
