<DESC>This agency proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) for add-on NSNs to the General Electric Aviation Systems Joint Opportunities Contract (JOC), SPE4A2-14-D-0001, a long-term strategic, sole source contract which will include multiple NSNs and FSCs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the General Electric Aviation Systems JOC, SPE4A2-14-D-0001, in accordance with the originally approved J&amp;A. However, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort.<br /><br />The proposed items are intended for addition to the existing sole source contract to General Electric Aviation Systems, SPE4A2-14-D-0001 for the following GEAS CAGEs: 07639, 35351 and 05624. A total of eight (8) NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. These items have been identified as sole source however some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. This is an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) with a remaining base period of two (2) years out of three (3) years with two (2) three-year option periods for a total duration of nine (9) years period of performance. The contract requires supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB: Origin and Inspection/Acceptance: Origin DLA Direct stock locations in accordance with the basic JOC. Subcontracting opportunities do exist for this effort. <br /><br />Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached lists of NSNs are the items that have been identified for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.<br /><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if any non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites will provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by November 20, 2015 and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil). The Government may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the Government.

<SOLNBR>DE-SOL-0009067
<CONTACT>George M. Lemasters

<a href="mailto:George.Lemasters@NETL.DOE.GOV">george.lemasters@netl.doe.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), intends to issue a competitive solicitation DE-SOL-0009067 as an unrestricted full and open competition for Identification and Characterization of Coal and Coal By-Products Containing High Rare Earth Element Concentrations. Anticipated work assignments for this service contract would support activities across all NETL sites, in Morgantown, WV, Pittsburgh, PA and Albany, OR. The resulting contract will be a multiple award fixed price contract with a base performance period of eighteen (18) months.  The anticipated award date for the resulting contract will be in first quarter fiscal year 2016.  Any questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist George.lemasters@netl.doe.gov, all correspondence shall be received no later than 20 October 2015 at 1600 ET.
1.	The services sought are to identify, locate, field sample, and chemically analyze U.S. domestic coal and coal by-product solid and/or liquid materials that contain high rare earth element (REE) concentrations, specifically materials containing total REEs at concentrations &#8805;300pm.  This effort is being conducted in support of potential technology development for the separation and recovery of REEs. The project, Identification and Characterization of Coal and Coal By-Products Containing High Rare Earth Element Concentrations, shall consist of the following five tasks:
              Task 1 &#61485; Project Management              Task 2 &#61485; Field Site Identification 	Task 3 &#61485; Field Site Sampling              Task 4 &#61485; Field Sample Material Analysis               Task 5 &#61485; Interim and Final Reports.
Task 1 &#61485; Project Management, shall address monitoring of the overall and daily project performance and technical accomplishments, achievement of milestones and deliverables, maintaining/tracking budget spending, and completion of required reporting.
Task 2 &#61485; Field Site Identification, shall address the rationale for specific field site sampling.  In this Task, the Contractor shall demonstrate an understanding of the coal and related material REE concentrations and phase mineralogy that has been documented in the open publication literature (i.e., journals; conferences; etc.), as well as potential REE field site locations as addressed in state and U.S. Geological Surveys, etc.  The Contractor shall provide rationale in a Project Sampling Plan to NETL as to the domestic location that sampling shall be undertaken during conduct of this project, as well as the type of material sampled (i.e., run of mine coal, roof rock, overburden clays, fly and of bottom ashes from demonstration and/or commercial coal combustion and/or gasification facilities, ash holding ponds, shale interlayer formations, etc.). The Contractor shall prepare and present the Project Sampling Plan to NETL, 60 days after start of contract, obtaining concurrenc e of site sampling locations prior to initiating the field sampling effort in Task 3.
In Task 3 &#61485; Field Site Sampling, the Contractor shall address the manner in which field materials shall be sampled, and the anticipated quantity of materials sample.  Sampling of materials is preferred within a 200-300 mile radius of the Contractor?s location, but may be undertaken at alternate domestic field locations.  Sampling and removal of high REE-containing material shall be undertaken to provide a statistically significant representation of material at each location site, in particular where materials are identified to contain &#8805; 300 ppm total REE (i.e., 30 samples at each location; cumulative value reported as X?2&#1005;).  All materials shall be described in terms of field site location (i.e., county and/or state, as appropriate, not disclosing sensitive or proprietary information), the nature of the material as either having been generated commercially (i.e., combustion or gasification facility, etc.) or naturally occurring, and if non-proprietary, an historica l genesis with respect to the material?s formation.  Sampling that is conducted shall be used to supplement information contained in DOE NETL?s EDX public database (https://edx.netl.doe.gov/ree/).
Nominally, 100 discrete materials (preferably 100-200 samples; run of mine coal, roof rock, overburden clays, fly and of bottom ashes from demonstration and/or commercial coal combustion and/or gasification facilities, ash holding ponds, or shale interlayer formations, etc.) containing &#8805;300 ppm total REEs shall be characterized in Task 4 &#61485; Field Sample Materials Analysis.  All characterization of the field sampled materials shall be reported, which includes analyses conducted at the field site location where materials were selected and removed.  In addition, post-field laboratory characterization shall be described in terms of the analytical procedures (i.e., ASTM standards, if utilized, and sample preparation procedures, etc.) and techniques, equipment utilized (i.e., model number; etc.), and the resulting REE concentrations with standard deviation reported for each element on a dry, non-ash basis relative to the starting material.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command / NAS Patuxent River, MD intends to issue a sole source award to Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC), Dallas, TX, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1) and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i). The requirement is for the contractor to provide target material TOPSCENE database production and maintenance and pre-planned TOPSCENE software product improvements for Mission Rehearsal Scene Visualization for Naval Aviation and life cycle support of TOPSCENE legacy software products as well as to support contingency operations through target identification if requested. Tactical Operational Scene (TOPSCENE) is the Navy's program of record for Mission Rehearsal Scene Visualization for Naval Aviation. The key TOPSCENE objectives are to provide software products and support of the fielded mission rehearsal systems as standalone software applications or as integrated software within the Naval Aviation Mission Planning Environment. LMMFC will be required to produce software products that support geo-specific scene visualization, weapon and sensor specific simulation, and interoperability with legacy mission planning systems and software, e.g. Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), and Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS). Since the inception of the TOPSCENE Program at Milestone B, 4th quarter FY1990, LMMFC has been the sole designer, developer and producer of the TOPSCENE/TTVS application.
<p>LMMFC is the only source with the requisite knowledge and experience to complete the development, integration and production of the TOPSCENE/TTVS software products to meet the Navy's requirements. The Navy does not have a complete technical data and computer software package, nor sufficient license rights in the technical data and computer software delivered necessary to conduct a competition. Therefore, LMMFC is the sole source capable of providing the support and producing the software products required. See numbered note 22.</p>

<DESC><p>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), St. Inigoes, Maryland intends to award a firm fixed-price contract for the procurement of a Motorola Solutions, Inc., (Motorola) five (5) channel trunked repeater site, network router, network fault management site and two (2) MCC7500 Internet Protocol Dispatch Consoles, on a sole source basis with Motorola (CAGE 78205); Columbia, Maryland. This equipment shall connect remote site Naval Support Facility (NSF) Deveselu Romania to the Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (ELMR) Master Site/Zone Core at Naval Support Activity (NSA) Sigonella and NSA Bahrain as well as, provide the site with Motorola's Dynamic System Resilience (DSR) capability. Connecting the remote NSF Deveselu Romania site to the ELMR network and providing DSR technology will provide this site with additional architecture resilience and increased system uptime through the risk mitigation provided by DSR technology.</p>
<p>CNIC has standardized its ELMR network on the Motorola ASTRO 25 IV&amp;D trunked radio system, which includes DSR technology. The DSR technology is proprietary to Motorola. In addition, the Navy's ELMR system is required to have an Over the Air Programming (OTAP) solution that allows subscriber radios to be accessed and updated over-the-air via the ELMR system; enabling authorized managers to reconfigure the functionality of subscriber radios without ever physically touching the radios. The Motorola ASTRO 25 IV&amp;D system provides for OTAP in the existing ELMR network via their Motorola Programming over Project 25 (POP25) feature. OTAP has not been standardized industry-wide, and the various OTAP capabilities and features, each proprietary to its manufacturer, are not interchangeable or interoperable with the existing Motorola ASTRO25 IV&amp;D trunked system or POP25 features/capabilities. Therefore, Motorola is the only source capable of providing the equipment necessary to connect the remote NSF Deveselu Romania site to the existing ELMR network.</p>
<p>The government intends to award this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304(C)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The synopsis announcement below replaces the one posted on 02/10/2015.<br /><br />NSWC Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division - Picatinny Detachment requires labor, material, and services required to support the Gun Weapon System Repair Program (GWSRP) in removal, installation, refurbishment, Fleet Technical Assistance and Maintenance, and Modernization of various Gun Weapon System (GWS) Equipment, and Ancillary/Support Equipment under the cognizance of the GWSRP Program. Thus, the expected contract vehicle referenced under this synopsis shall be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that will extend no longer than three years (36 months), if all options are exercised, from contract award. It will consist of one base year plus two option years. Task and delivery orders will be placed as both cost-plus-fixed-fee and firm-fixed-price, as appropriate. This requirement is considered full and open. The NAICS code is 811219. The Size Standard is $19M. The FSC code is J010. This synopsis is for non-commercial services. The upcoming solicitation number will be N00174-16-R-0001, and will be issued as a request for proposal (RFP). Proposals will be requested with the release of the solicitation.<br /><br />The Contractor's support shall be in accordance with specific, individually written task orders issued by NSWC IHEODTD within the general scope of the applicable Performance Based Statement of Work (PWS). <br /><br />The Government intends to make a single award resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose submissions, which comply with the instructions and conform to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors for award. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: (a) technical capability of the items and services offered to meet the minimum needs of the Government based on examination of technical approach narrative, relevant corporate experience, equipment, and personnel resources; (b) Past Performance (see FAR 52.212-1(b)(10)); and (c) Cost. These factors are of equal importance. All non-priced factors, when combined, are approximately equal to Cost in importance. However, Cost becomes more of a deciding factor of importance when offerors receive similar ratings for the other factors. General statements, that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or that paraphrases the RFP's specifications in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirements concerning the content of the technical proposal.<br /><br />Copies of solicitation N00174-16-R-0001 will NOT be emailed, faxed, mailed or provided in person. These types of requests WILL NOT BE ACKNOWLEDGED. This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov. NOTE: Offerors are ineligible for award unless registered in DOD's Central Contractor Registration Database which has now been integrated with the System for Award Management (SAM). Information regarding registration and annual confirmation requirements is available at 1-866-606-8220 and http://www.sam.gov.<br /><br />Any resultant contract will be DO Rated under the Defense Priorities and Allocations system (DPAS). <br /><br />The deadline to respond to this synopsis is 21&nbsp;October 2015. <br /><br />The Contract Specialist must receive any and all questions concerning the RFP no later than 5 business days before the response date of this solicitation. No questions will be accepted after the close of the solicitation. Offers and inquiries may be submitted via electronic mail to edward.rogan@navy.mil or mailed to the attention of Eddie Rogan, Code 022ER at NSWC Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division - Picatinny Detach, Building 61, Code 022ER, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.<br /><br />It is the REGISTRANT'S responsibility to periodically check FedBizOpps.

<DESC>1.0	Purpose <br>  <br> The purpose of this market survey is to gain knowledge of industry's interest in participating in a Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) Performance and Interoperability Quick-look 5th iteration (SIQ-5). This market survey is also to understand industry interest in utilizing and interacting with the Government during the FY2016 period to facilitate the porting, integration, and testing of SRW on vendors Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms. Information gathered from this survey will assist the Government in determining Government personnel resources and specific schedules required to assist vendors in the porting, integration, and testing process of SRW. The Government's intent of this porting and integration technical support and Quick-look event is to enable a mature SRW marketplace based on the most enhanced, operationally relevant, and sustainable tactical networking waveforms available. <br>    <br> 2.0	Background <br>  <br> Product Manager (PdM) Waveforms envisions assisting industry by facilitating vendor waveform porting of designated SRW variants.  Further, the Government envisions providing all vendors meeting the entrance criteria in section 3.0 below with Government assistance in the porting of designated Government reference SRW software to vendor platforms.  The location of the Government's assistance can be, at the Government's discretion, at the vendor's or Government's facilities, or a combination of the two. Porting assistance is planned to be available throughout the FY2016 period and will be provided on an as needed basis.  <br>  <br> The SIQ event is planned to occur at some time during the April 2016 - September 2016 timeframe for a four week duration.

It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.
<p><br />Background<br />The US Army Contracting Command, in support of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), Joint Project Manager Information Systems (JPM IS), is conducting market research related to the Joint Effects Model (JEM). JEM is a web-based, software-only application that supplies the Department of Defense (DoD) with the single accredited and operationally tested tool to model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents. JEM combines the best components from existing CBRN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) models into a single application. JEM provides rapid estimates of hazards and effects that can be integrated into the Common Operational Picture (COP). JEM supports planning to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). JEM also supports the analytical requirements for large scale studies conducted by multiple agencies throughout the DoD.<br /><br />JEM may be used at any level from strategic to tactical, CONUS or OCONUS, to collect and report CBRN event data from CBRN warning systems and observations from land, air, and maritime units. The plumes of CBRN events are computed, formatted for use by the warning system, and broadcast for operational CBRN cells' COP to provide a standardized picture of the effects of the CBRN material throughout the battlespace taking into account terrain and weather information. Analytic, reach back, and intelligence data can be shared between CBRN cells to further describe the effects of the CBRN event. JEM may be accessed through its Command and Control (C2) host system or it may be installed as a stand-alone software application on a computer that is not interfaced with or networked into a C2 system. JEM may be accessed in a network-enabled version of the stand-alone configuration that is independent of a host C2 system. JEM can also be hosted in a cloud-based implementation, such as MilCloud.<br /><br />Current Program Status<br />Acquisition management for JEM is provided by the Joint Project Manager for Information Systems (JPM IS), a project office of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD). Requirements for JEM are generated by the Joint Requirements Office for CBRN Defense (JRO-CBRND), working together with the JEM stakeholders and the JEM Program Management Office (PMO).<br /><br />The current JEM capability is developed and fielded in two increments:<br />&bull; JEM Increment 1 (Incr 1) is based on requirements contained in the JEM Operational Requirements Document (ORD) approved in 2004. The program transitioned CBRN-D hazard modeling capability from the Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO) and other agencies into a baselined program of record. Source models for JEM Incr 1 included HPAC, VLSTRACK, and D2Puff. The program followed a traditional development approach and began fielding in 2008. JEM Incr 1 fielding includes Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to several allied government militaries.<br /><br />&bull; JEM Increment 2 (Incr 2) is the first program within the Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) to be developed and fielded under the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Information Technology Box (IT-Box) Construct. The Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) in June 2014. The JEM Incr 2 program achieved Milestone B and approval for Build Decision 1 in September 2014 and potentially begins a limited fielding of the standalone product in the 2QFY16. Under the JEM IT-Box, requirements documents have been divided into five Requirements Definition Packages (RDPs). JEM Incr 2 includes five RDPs:<br />o RDP 1 - Baseline Capabilities (document approved by Protection&nbsp;&nbsp; Functional Capability Board). RDP 1 transitions all of JEM Incr 1 capability into a web-based application utilizing the Ozone Widget Framework (OWF); upgrades to latest S&amp;T models; introduces urban dispersion modeling; and refactors software architecture to align with the Common CBRN Modeling Interface (CCMI). There are 4 planned Capability Drops (CDs) from FY16-FY19.<br />o RDP 2 - Command and Control (C2) Integration (document in draft). RDP 2 hosts JEM Incr 2 on selected Joint and Service C2 systems, as necessary. There are eight planned CDs tied to each C2 requirement from FY17-TBD<br />o RDP 3 - Analytical Support. RDP 3 provides a more flexible implementation of JEM Incr 2 scientific/analytical tools to support strategic and operational analyses conducted by DoD, Joint and Service laboratories and their agents. There are 2 planned CDs in which the date range is TBD.<br />o RDP 4 - Emerging Capabilities. RDP 4 includes transition of modeling capabilities that are not yet sufficiently mature for fielding, but are currently under development, testing, and verification by the S&amp;T community. There are 5 planned CDs from FY19-TBD<br />o RDP 5 - Modernization and Sustainment. This RDP will cover modernization and sustainment outside of the currently planned completion of JEM Incr 2 development. There are two CDs planned per year through the remaining life of the program starting in FY17.<br /><br /><br />Key Concepts<br />Joint and Service Specific Command and Control (C2)<br />All capabilities integrated into the JEM baseline product must be able to be utilized in both a Standalone mode (both networked and non-networked) and as an integrated capability resident or accessible to Joint and Service specific Command and Control (C2) systems. These C2 environments are hosted on a variety of operating systems. A preferred solution will be easily transferable between these environments and able to adapt to both current and future environments, such as future DoD architectures that utilize the Ozone Widget Framework (OWF) and the DISA milCloud.<br /><br />Common CBRN Modeling Interface (CCMI)<br />The CCMI has been developed to facilitate better implementation of a plug-and-play architecture through the use of a common set of industry standards, technologies, and tools. This development has included participation from an industry consortium where all activities have been openly documented. <br />&emsp;<br /><br />Key Technologies Utilized by JEM<br /><br />The JEM program uses and seeks expertise in the following program areas:<br />1. Effective implementation of Agile development process within the DoD acquisition framework that produces "robustly done" software products and deliveries<br />2.

National Guard Bureau Civil Support Team (CST) modeling priorities <br />x. Weather interfaces and wind modeling to support CBRN-D hazard prediction<br />y. Oceanographic interfaces and water current modeling<br /><br />Request for Information (RFI)<br />The JPM-IS is seeking providers of integration services that can manage a team of highly technical CBRN hazard modeling physicists and subject matter experts that provide software solutions to the Increment 1 and 2 targeted capabilities listed above and that can fit into a CCMI compliant architecture. These capabilities might include improved implementations of the existing legacy products that have been rewritten or redesigned for use in other configurations or at other government agencies.<br /><br />In addition, the JPM-IS is interested in other mature CBRN modeling capability. Ideally, this mature capability would be those types of utilities that have been employed by operational forces and first responders in real work environments or as part of documented advanced technology demonstrations, operational exercises, or experiments. They should be deemed to provide added utility and value to Warfighters, Strategic Planners, CBRN Analysts, and First Responders. Any submissions must include concepts of operation that were employed with this capability.</p>

<CONTACT>Shawn P. Haubner, Mr., Phone 5082336167, Email shawn.p.haubner.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p>SYNOPSIS<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201e. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The Government will NOT pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is no way obligated by the information received. This notice is for market research purposes only to obtain information regarding (1) the availability and capability of all qualified performer sources, (2) including small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; small disadvantaged businesses; and universities and educational institutions, (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for the proposed acquisition. The applicable NAICS Code is 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology). Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method for the rapid execution of Joint Improvised Threat Agency-Initiatives.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Battle Management Directorate, Force Protection Division, Counter Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) Section and Army Contracting Command- Aberdeen Proving Ground- Natick Contracting Division supports the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency (JIDA) (formerly JIEDDO) in their mission to counter improvised threats with tactical responsiveness and anticipatory acquisition in support of Combatant Commanders' efforts to prepare for, and react to, battlefield surprise in support of counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency, and other related mission areas including Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED). JIDA develops and delivers capabilities within three to 24 months.<br /><br />JIDA currently has three primary Lines of Operations (LOOs): Attack the Network, Defeat the Device, and Train the Force. The Attack the Network line of operation enables offensive operations against complex networks of financiers, improvised explosive device makers, trainers and their supporting infrastructure by providing intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance, information operations, counter-bomber targeting, biometrics and weapons technical intelligence capabilities.<br />Historically, the C-IED Section has been assigned execution authority over the following technology areas in support of the Attack the Network LOO:<br />&bull; Small Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) Synthetic Aperture Radars<br />&bull; Small SWaP Multi and Hyper Spectral Near Visible Infrared (VISNIR), Short Wave Infrared (SWIR), and Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) sensors<br />&bull; Integration of sensors on small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs)</p>
<p>Future initiatives expected in this area also include electromagnetic signal interception and biometrics.</p>
<p>The JIDA requirements process timeline which approves initiatives is normally 30 days. The acquisition community is then directed to obligate the funds and begin executing a solution within 60 days. Most often, the final solution to an initiative is required in less than 12 months. In some situations, a suitable technology or group of technologies is already in development through existing Department of Defense contracts. In these scenarios, the acquisition community is able to rapidly obligate and execute JIDA initiatives without additional programmatic risk to their schedules.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201e. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The Government will NOT pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is no way obligated by the information received. This notice is for market research purposes only to obtain information regarding (1) the availability and capability of all qualified performer sources, (2) including small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; small disadvantaged businesses; and universities and educational institutions, (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for the proposed acquisition. The applicable NAICS Code is 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology). Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method for the rapid execution of Joint Improvised Threat Agency-Initiatives.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Battle Management Directorate, Force Protection Division, Counter Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) Section and Army Contracting Command- Aberdeen Proving Ground- Natick Contracting Division supports the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency (JIDA) (formerly JIEDDO) in their mission to counter improvised threats with tactical responsiveness and anticipatory acquisition in support of Combatant Commanders' efforts to prepare for, and react to, battlefield surprise in support of counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency, and other related mission areas including Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED). JIDA develops and delivers capabilities within three to 24 months.<br /><br />JIDA currently has three primary Lines of Operations (LOOs): Attack the Network, Defeat the Device, and Train the Force. The Defeat the Device LOO is further comprised of three (3) distinct capability areas: Detect Systems, Neutralize Systems, and Mitigate Systems.<br />The Detection Systems capability area seeks to identify IEDs and/or the people operating them before they detonate. Detect ground systems; seek to detect person-borne, vehicle-borne and buried IEDs, as well as suspicious activity associated with IED emplacement. These systems include persistent threat detection, persistent group surveillance systems and handheld/ airborne ground-penetrating radar systems. Detect air systems allow the warfighter to better predict where and how the enemy is employing IEDs and reveal the nature and location of enemy IED networks through aerial detection.<br /><br />The Neutralize Systems capability area uses technological solutions to deny the enemy the ability to trigger IEDs. Systems such as ultra-light weight reconnaissance robots and line charges provide warfighters the capability to identify and neutralize IED systems before they detonate.<br /><br />The Mitigate Systems capability area seeks to minimize effects of IED blasts on people, equipment and facilities by pre-detonation and providing standoff distances. This is done through JIDA-funded counter-IED initiatives such as mine rollers, ground detection and armor protection. Rollers mitigate the effects of victim-operated IEDs by pre-detonating them from a safe distance, thus reducing casualties and vehicle damage.<br />Historically, the C-IED Section has been assigned execution authority over the following detection technology areas:<br />&bull; Small Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) Synthetic Aperture Radars<br />&bull; Small SWaP Multi and Hyper Spectral Near Visible Infrared (VISNIR), Short Wave Infrared (SWIR), and Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) sensors<br />&bull; Integration of sensors on small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs)<br />&bull; Standoff detection of Personnel Borne IEDS (PBIEDs)<br />&bull; Entry Control Point (ECP) PBIED Detection<br />&bull; Handheld IED Detection<br />&bull; Vehicle Bourne IED (VBIED) Detection
<p>The JIDA requirements process timeline which approves initiatives is normally 30 days. The acquisition community is then directed to obligate the funds and begin executing a solution within 60 days. Most often, the final solution to an initiative is required in less than 12 months. In some situations, a suitable technology or group of technologies is already in development through existing Department of Defense contracts. In these scenarios, the acquisition community is able to rapidly obligate and execute JIDA initiatives without additional programmatic risk to their schedules. However, in other situations an existing contract vehicle with appropriate scope does not exist, which introduces an unacceptable level of risk to initiative schedules. <br /><br />OBJECTIVES<br /><br />The objective of this RFI is to gather information that will assist in the determination of a suitable acquisition solution for a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to begin initiative execution within the JIDA driven 60 day requirement where an appropriate contracting alternative does not already exist. Equally important is the need to ensure rapid delivery of effective initiative solutions. The QRC must also be affordable; thereby ensuring the initiative funding is applied to the technical solutions to the greatest extent possible.<br /><br />Initiatives can include feasibility studies; Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) activities; prototyping, Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) procurement, modification of COTS technology, integration, and operational assessment.<br /><br />Initiatives in the Defeat the Device LOO are expected to include the detection, neutralization, and mitigation of a myriad of threats, including:<br />&bull; Surface and subsurface emplaced IEDs<br />&bull; Home Made Explosive materials (e.g. Ammonium Nitrate, Calcium Ammonium Nitrate, Potassium Chlorate, Urea Nitrate (etc.)<br />&bull; Ground and Air Vehicle Bourne IEDs<br />&bull; Personnel Bourne IEDs<br /><br />Respondents are invited to provide materials related to their capabilities to fulfill ANY OR ALL of the inquiries listed above. Respondents should provide responses whether their level of interest and current capability is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm.<br /><br />SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br /><br />All written responses must be received by November 5, 2015 at 3:00 PM EST.

JIDA develops and delivers capabilities within three to 24 months.<br /><br />JIDA currently has three primary Lines of Operations (LOOs): Attack the Network, Defeat the Device, and Train the Force. Historically these LOOs have been focused on the IED Threat, however recent changes to JIDA's mission drives the organization to broaden its focus beyond the IED. This new focus includes "improvised threats".<br /><br />Improvised threats are those threats which our adversaries use to counter our technical overmatch. They are typically an adaption of cheaply available technologies or Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) which are easily transformed and made effective by the use of available and expendable manpower to make them lethal. The IED is a well understood example of an improvised threat, as it brought to bear low cost available resources to make explosives and devices, evolving TTPs which undermined US and Coalition capabilities to detect or prevent them, and available and expendable manpower to emplace and detonate them. JIDA's new mission includes the IED threat and any new improvised threats which may include challenges such as tunnel operations and small UAV threats. JIDA's goal is to be as adaptive and innovative in defeating these threats as our adversaries are at implementing and evolving them. <br /><br />The C-IED Section expects execution authority over the following technology areas:<br />&bull; Small Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) Synthetic Aperture Radars<br />&bull; Small SWaP Multi and Hyper Spectral Near Visible Infrared (VISNIR), Short Wave Infrared (SWIR), and Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) sensors<br />&bull; Integration of sensors on small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs)<br />&bull; Air or ground based Acoustics, Seismic, and Radar technologies

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE posted for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified small business sources, including 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB), HUBZone small business, and women-owned small business (WOSB), to perform a potential requirement. Teaming arrangements and Joint Ventures are encouraged. <br />The CMS Center for Medicare (CM) is conducting market research to identify qualified sources that meet the requirements generally described in this notice. <br />THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THE RESULTS OF THIS MARKET RESEARCH.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicare program, providing health care security and choice for aged and disabled people in this country. Jointly with the State governments, CMS administers the Medicaid program and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). CMS is the largest purchaser of health care in the United States - our programs account for more than one third of the dollars spent on health care in the U.S. economy. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), Public Law 105 33, established a program, Medicare + Choice (currently referred to as Medicare Advantage or MA), which is the authority permitting contracts between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and a variety of different managed care and fee-for-service entities. The entities providing services to beneficiaries under Medicare Advantage (MA) are known as Medicare Advantage organizations (MA organizations). CMS currently has over 600 MA Organizations participating in the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA/PD), Medicare Prescription Drug program (PDP).<br />Under the MA program, MA organizations are paid on a capitated basis using a methodology that establishes payment rates on a per capita basis. The specific rate for each MA enrollee is determined by demographic variables and health status. The health status data, known as risk adjustment data is collected by CMS under a regulatory provision that requires MA organizations to submit inpatient and ambulatory services provided to MA enrollees. CMS utilizes risk adjustment data to calculate a risk adjustment factor, which is applied to the capitated payment for each MA organization enrollee.<br />Over the past several years, there has been dramatic growth in the MA program. Today, approximately one-third of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in MA plans and CMS pays these organizations approximately $160 billion per year for the care provided to these 16.6 million beneficiaries. To date, however, CMS has not had sufficiently detailed information on the health care it purchases. In 2009, CMS changed its regulations to allow for the collection of encounter data records and began requiring MA organizations, starting in 2012, to submit to CMS information that is equivalent to the information provided on a Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claim record. The Encounter Data System (EDS) was developed to support the collection of MA encounters and is now in its fourth year of operation. To date CMS has collected approximately 1.3 billion encounter data records (EDRs). These data will allow CMS to recalibrate the risk adjustment payment model, so that MA payments more accurately reflect the demographics, patterns of care, and the predicted costs of diseases for MA enrollees. CMS would also be able to evaluate coverage, profile and analyze service utilization, assess quality of care, with the goal of reducing fraud, waste and abuse and improving Medicare programs and healthcare in general. <br />CMS is collecting and processing encounter data records that are submitted under the capitated model of the financial alignment demonstration. CMS is working with participating States to test a new payment and service delivery model to improve the quality of care that individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (Medicare-Medicaid enrollees) receive. Similar to EDR submission requirements for MA organizations, Medicare-Medicaid plans (MMPs), participating in the demonstrations, are required to submit encounter data on services delivered to dual eligible enrollees. <br />CMS collects MA Medicare and MMP data on a smaller format for Risk Adjustment Processing Systems (RAPS). This is a limited number of data elements also collected for use in the calculation of the risk adjustment payment. <br />With the inclusion of the MMPs to the EDR collection data, CMS collects RAPS for Medicare, EDRs for Medicare and Medicaid for Institutional, Professional, Durable Medical Equipment (DME), as well as Medicaid Dental. In addition to the Medicare and Medicaid medical data, CMS collects Prescription Drug Event Data for use in administration of the MA Prescription Drug (MAPD) program.<br />For all systems, files and reports are returned to the submitters providing status of the files submitted to CSFES.<br />The Customer Support Front-End System provides all systems development and interfaces for the MAs to connect and submit the data to CMS as well as, functions such as the Help Desk for MAs and Support to CMS in administration of the guidance to the MAs.<br />The Contractor will receive approximately 5 million EDRs submitted by Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMPs) daily on the X12 837 Professional, 837 Institutional, 837 Dental and NCPDP file formats. These records will contain information on services and items provided to Medicare and dual eligible enrollees by institutional, professional providers (including home health agencies and hospices), suppliers, other health care providers and atypical providers. The Contractor will receive approximately 7 million PDE records; and 6-10 million RAPS records daily. The contractor will transfer the data in an established time frame and in a specified format to the CMS Contractors responsible for the Encounter Data Processing System, the RAS System, and the Prescription Drug System (PDS). All processing activities supported by the contractor will be based on requirements developed and maintained by the contractor based on direction from CMS.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of this requirement is to acquire a Customer Support Front-End System and associated Help Desk services to support CMS as follows:<br />&bull; Maintain/Develop Front End System processing for Risk Adjustment (RA), Prescription Drug Event (PDE), Encounter Data (ED), and Medicare Medicaid Plans (MMPs)<br />&bull; Maintain/Develop systems to send data to contractors, and CMS' Integrated Data Repository<br />&bull; Maintain/Develop systems to receive data from processing contractors and return reports/files to submitters<br />&bull; Provide customer support to the MAOs and third party submitters of the data files <br />&bull; Maintain/Develop Monitoring for MAOs/Submitters/CMS<br />Capability statement / information sought: Small business vendors interested in this opportunity should provide a response that includes the following information for CMS internal use and consideration in the acquisition plan.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Established in June 1917, Fort Jackson (the Installation), first known as the Sixth National Cantonment and later as Camp Jackson, has become the largest and most active Initial Entry Training Center in the United States Army. Established to answer America's call for trained fighting men in the early, ominous days of World War I, Fort Jackson has always served as the Army's pioneer in the training environment. Named in honor of Major General Andrew Jackson, a native son of the Palmetto State and the seventh president of the United States, Fort Jackson, which is located in the heart of the midlands region of South Carolina, was incorporated into the city of Columbia (the City) in 1968. The Installation's primary mission is providing the Army with trained, disciplined, motivated and physically fit Soldiers who uphold the Army's core values and are focused on teamwork. Succeeding in that mission means training in excess of 36,000 basic training and 8,000 advanced individual training Soldiers every year. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Fort Jackson is home to the U.S. Army Soldier Support Institute, the U.S. Army Chaplains Center and School, and the National Center for Credibility Assessment. It also is home to the Army's Drill Sergeant School, which trains all active and Reserve instructors.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Installation encompasses more than 52,000 acres of land with more than 100 ranges and field training sites and 1,160 buildings. Soldiers, civilians, retirees, and family members make up the Fort Jackson community that continues to grow in numbers and facilities. The Installation is home to more than 3,500 assigned active duty Soldiers and their 12,000 family members.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Fort Jackson employs almost 3,500 civilians and provides services to more than 46,000 retirees and their family members. An additional 10,000 students attend courses at the Soldier Support Institute, Armed Forces Chaplaincy Center, the National Center for Credibility Assessment and Drill Sergeant School annually.</span></p>

<DESC>Market Research is being conducted to determine all potential socio-economic small businesses and large businesses interested in, and capable of, providing the services identified herein. The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 562211 with a small business size standard of $38,500,000.
<p><br />Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Keyport is seeking sources for a one-time pickup and disposal of 20 Mark 50 torpedo boilers, both fired (expended) and unfired. Boilers contain hazardous material, and no detonation or treatment is to be conducted on-site.</p>
<p>MK 50 boilers consist of MK 1 Mod 0, Mod 1, and Mod 2. Mod 0 and Mod 1 contain 15.8 lbs. of lithium and 4.25 of ALCLO (aluminum and potassium perchlorate). MK1 Mod 2 boilers contain 17.8 lbs. of micro-encapsulated (Teflon) lithium and 0.2436 lbs. (13 ft. at 8.5 grams/ft.) of detonation cord (Det-cord).</p>
<p>The lithium in both types is contained in an Inconel 625 shell and surrounded by 316 stainless Steel tubing. Total weight is approximately 65 pounds each. Expended boilers will contain various amounts of unreacted lithium and by-products (lithium sulfide and lithium fluoride). The exact amount depends upon the utilization (percent of the initial lithium fuel load that has been reacted) which varies from boiler to boiler.<br /><br />Methods of approved processes for treatment, recycle, or disposal include; safe activation of ALCLO (if required), freezing, shearing, cutting using band saw, pulverization using hammer mill, hydrolysis, incineration. Open burning/detonation of MK 50 boiler is not approved. Methods must follow EPA regulations for transportation and disposal of hazardous materials.</p>
<p>Interested vendors capable of performing this service are asked to complete the attached voluntary questionnaire. All information will be kept confidential and will not be disseminated to the public. This Sources Sought Notice and Market Research Questionnaire is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.</p>

The project is expected to take several months. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.
<p>The work of this project consists of the mechanical dredging of approximately 100,000 cubic yards of clay, silt, and sand, with unconfined open water disposal at the Mark Island Disposal Site, about 5 miles away. The dredging work consists of removing approximately 83,000 cubic yards from the 10-foot anchorage in Beals Harbor, which is about 800 feet by 500 feet in area, and approximately 17,000 cubic yards from shoaled portions of the one-mile-long 6-foot channel, which is 80 feet wide, and shoaled portions of the 6-foot anchorage, about 800 feet by 300 feet in area, of the Pig Island Gut Federal Navigation Project. About 30 tons of large debris, heavy boulders, and derelict moorings are also expected to be removed. The Contractor will be required to maintain a dredging production rate of not less than 30,000 cubic yards per month. There is occasional ice at Beals Harbor from mid-January to early March. Bidders should become familiar with the proposed haul route to the disposal site. Beals Harbor has not been maintained since 1956 and Pig Island Gut has not been maintained since 1965. Dredging operations will be permitted 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classification (i.e. HUBZone, small business, etc.), a proof of bonding as well as what type of equipment would be utilized for this project. Additionally, firms must demonstrate experience, within the last five years, in the following work requirements:<br />&bull; Experience dredging a minimum of 30,000 cubic yards in a month by mechanical means, during winter (December through February).<br />&bull; Experience in removal of heavy debris or large boulders from a marine environment.<br />&bull; Placement of dredged material at an ocean placement site.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of an extended warranty &amp; calibration services for AFRL's existing Teledyne LeCroy "LabMaster" Oscilloscope System. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106 (b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 811219. The size standard is $20,500,000.00.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Teledyne LeCroy, Inc., 700 Chestnut Ridge Road, Chestnut Ridge Road, NY 10977. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within three (3) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The proposed sole source is the only known source to the government that can both offer an extended warranty on and calibrate its own products. Procurement of a new oscilloscope with equivalent service contracts from another manufacturer would cause a significant cost increase and would cause a significant Non-Recurrent Engineering (NRE) effort to integrate the hardware, re-write software scripts, and develop equipment interfaces. The designs of oscilloscopes from other manufacturers are limited to four analog input channels, whereas the Teledyne LeCroy oscilloscope system contains twelve input channels. The NRE effort would increase the cost of the acquisition and require more than one man-year of effort, having significant mission impacts to schedule and operations with the potential risk that specific functionality required cannot be effectively duplicated.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to gregory.orlando@us.af.mil or julie.hansen.1@us.af.mil no later than 12:00 p.m. EST Thursday, 08 October 2015. Only inquiries/Information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Oscilloscope Maintenance." Note that email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter emails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the email may not get through the email filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with email ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The email filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<DESC>Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office 6 (NCO 6) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Becton, Dickinson and Company (DUNS:  024230633), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  The proposed sole source contract is for Becton, Dickinson brand reagents, in the part numbers and quantities outlined in the below table. The reagents will be used in the Becton, Dickinson brand molecular diagnostics equipment, specifically the BD Facscalibur Flow Cytometer.  The antibodies (provided in the table below) currently in use were evaluated for reactivity and specificity.  Any new antibody is evaluated in the same way and is not restricted to BD. However, any change in antibodies currently in use would require extensive review that would be both costly and time consuming.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement to the contracting office no later than Monday, October 5, 2015, 07:30PM, EST. Interest/capability statements may be sent to Daniel Spaulding (contractor) at daniel.spaulding@va.gov.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) Consolidated Library (NCL)
<SOLNBR>OCSA-201601
<RESPDATE>102015
<CONTACT>Demetrius R. Green, Contracting Officer, Email demetrius.r.green@nga.mil - Erik J. Rodriguez, Contract Specialist, Email erik.j.rodriguez@nga.mil
<DESC>1. Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to issue a sole source modification of the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) Consolidated Library (NCL) contract awarded to BAE Systems - Information Solutions, Inc. As a result of this modification the period of performance for the contract will not change, however the anticipated value of this sole source modification is estimated to be approximately $25 million.
<p>2. This notice is being published in accordance with FAR 5.2 requiring the dissemination of information on proposed contract actions. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source modification to the NCL contract. The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a). There is a reasonable basis to conclude that the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>3. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to response to the requirement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. NGA requires the addition of the NSG Application Schema (NAS) 7.0 ontology, version control for the ontologies, data releasability controls, geography based authorization for domestic data, and cross domain transfer synchronization capabilities to the current FCMS baseline. This includes the development and fielding of a fully populated multi-domain, releasibility-controlled SOM library.) NGA requires that this support be commenced immediately.</p>
<p>4. The NCL contract is a centrally managed, high-availability library architecture consisting of two National Data Libraries (NDLs) that manage the input, storage, discoverability, cross-domain transfer and dissemination of GEOINT data. GEOINT as defined by NGA is the use of imagery, imagery intelligence and geospatial data to describe, assess, and depict features and activities and their location on Earth." GEOINT data types include but are not limited to National Technical Means (NTM), Airborne imagery, and Commercial imagery, motion video, vector data, and unstructured non-raster data such as intelligence reports, blogs, documents, spreadsheets, objects, features, and links between objects. BAE Systems - Information Solutions, Inc. is the current contractor for the NCL contract.</p>
<p>5. The NCL contract includes a requirement to interface with the NGA Resource Tasking Marketplace (RTM) 3.x contracts workflow management for "non-traditional" non-Raster data management tools known as FCMS and SOM. These "non-traditional" data types include intelligence reports, blogs, documents, spreadsheets, and a variety of other means of recording intelligence elements which enable interagency collaboration and big picture intelligence gathering.</p>
<p>6. SOM is an integral part of transformative SOA, with NCL requirements tightly coupled to operational effectivities of NES/Cedalion, NSG Application Schema (NAS) compliance and the retirements of legacy systems (STARE, GOWK, GERT, CASi). Costs to delay retirement of those legacy systems or o build an interim interface capability pending the outcome of a competition would be significant. Under the current baseline contract, NCL contractor as already established the foundational work to establish database repositories, interfaces and communications channels for the consolidation of those workspaces. Within the SOA constructs, these are services that are shared between the many capabilities organic to the NCL design. If NGA were to compete the work covered by the above-described modification to the NCL contract, it is the Government's opinion that it is likely that award of this work to a contractor other than the incumbent would result in a substantial duplication of costs not likely to be recovered through competition. For example, a different vendor may require a different technical solution, resulting in significant delays and cost in laying new groundwork within the NCL.</p>
<p>7. The software to establish a library that contains structured and unstructured data as well as dissemination across the globe is inherent in the baseline architecture for the library. As of 12 July 2015, the NCL program deployed the NCL 1.1 baseline to both NDLs at the East and West, providing the initial foundation of the NCL for NGA. These development, non-recurring costs are sunk costs and the remaining work on these items is for development, independent testing and operational transition of additional releases (NCL 1.1.1, NCL 1.2 and NCL 1.3), which will implement further capabilities in accordance with the NCL Requirements Document (NCLRD).</p>
<p>8. A new vendor would need to stand up a program office with the essential corporate infrastructure costs, and rebuild a subset of these basic, common library functions in order to operate as a library within the NSG. In addition a new vendor would have a substantial learning curve that would add significant cost risk to not only their system development but to the programs that are leveraging the known NCL interfaces and capabilities in their design, e.g. RTM 3.x. The NCL is designed to simplify and consolidate the NSG architecture. If multiple data stores were created, the impact to the NGS would be duplication of development and hardware costs and increased Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) costs. This is especially critical as NCL is now deployed and operational; serving the GEOINT needs of NGA's warfighter customers.</p>
<p>9. While the operational NCL itself could be provided as Government Furnished Equipment in a new competition, certain services, architectures and functions would require duplication in a developmental test laboratory. Additionally, a new vendor may have a new/different technical solution for the FCMS/SOM activities; therefore, in addition to costs for replication of foundational library services, the cost of infrastructure and software licensing would need to be incorporated as unknown costs in a new design. A new contractor will have to invest in infrastructure and software necessary to support their technical solution. Integration of a new design resulting from competition for FCMS and SOM into the existing NCL framework introduces interface, database and cost risks to the enterprise. The current NCL vendor has the infrastructure and some of the software necessary to complete the required tasks.</p>
<p>10. As a result of the discussion herein, the Government acknowledges that while other vendors may possess the technical capability to deliver these requirements for the NCL contract, the significant duplication of costs that will not be recouped via competition, the necessary learning curve for complex FCMS and SOM requirements and an establishment of a new vendor infrastructure make BAE the only source that can provide this support immediately, as required by the Government.</p>
<p>11. Lastly, an open competition for future NSG requirements is planned to be conducted and awarded before the NCL contract ends on 31 July 2017. An RFI, soliciting preliminary ideas and innovation from industry for the follow-on activity is anticipated to be released in October 2015.</p>

For promising technologies capable of grid integration and other stationary applications, the DOE OE can provide support through both these resources and labor for carrying out third party evaluation of technologies. Interested developers from the R&amp;D through commercially deployed stages (solutions with technology readiness level between 3 and 9) are encouraged to submit applications. Applications are currently being accepted and will be evaluated for suitability to carry out validation at Sandia. Sandia is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Opportunity Description:</strong></span></p>
<p>Manufacturers, integrators and consumers of stationary energy storage are encouraged to apply for third party testing of storage solutions identified for stationary applications. Selected technologies will be evaluated. Sandia will determine the appropriate scale of the validation activity and test plan to be followed, and will carry out in-house evaluation and public reporting of the results from such testing. The industrial partner will be expected to provide batteries for testing.</p>
<p>The industrial partner will be expected to provide batteries for testing and to participate in project discussions and data review efforts.</p>
<p>Applications for analysis at the ESAL will be considered for DC technologies to run under the DOE "Protocol for Uniformly Measuring and Expressing the Performance of Energy Storage Systems" frequency regulation application, along with analysis of performance metrics. This protocol is attached for reference.</p>
<p>The Energy Storage Test Pad has opportunities for grid connected energy storage systems to be analyzed for A: performance of grid support functions, and/or B: safety in the deployment environment. Test articles will be used to validate common test protocols and to develop advanced protocols for the performance and safety of energy storage systems. Battery systems may be required to provide representative cells and or modules for performance and safety analysis in the ESAL prior to system testing. Grid support functions include area regulation, frequency regulation, voltage support and many other automated and commanded operation modes. Performance of these functions will be analyzed using test procedures designed to derive salient metrics. Test procedures will be mutually agreed upon by Sandia and the collaborating partner. Safety will be analyzed using Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), which will help develop a systematic test program to validate the enforcement of safety constraints. When supplying a proposal for testing services, please provide all requested information from the application packet.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Information Sought:</strong></span></p>
<p>A detailed description of the technology and proposed application is required.

<SOLNBR>W9127N-16-R-0020
<RESPDATE>110415
<CONTACT>David C. Boone, Contract Specialist, Phone 5038084614, Email david.c.boone@usace.army.mil
<DESC>This synopsis and notice of intent to sole-source is prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 5.2 Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Portland District intends to negotiate and award a sole-source no-fee Cost Reimbursement type contract with the Port of Portland in Portland, Oregon for the operation and maintenance of the Dredge OREGON. The period of performance of this contract will be 1 October 2016 through 30 September 2017. The work will include dredging of approximately 2.5 million to 3 million cubic yards of material from the Columbia River deep draft navigation channel between river mile 3+00+00 and river mile 105+00+00; maximum pay dredging depth will vary between -43' CRD and -48' CRD. The majority of the dredged material will be placed upland or used for shoreline nourishment. Exact dredging and placement locations will be provided by the Government during the period of performance. The environmentally cleared dredging window for work in this location is June 1 through December 15. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 237990. The statutory authority for this sole-source award is FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>Improvements to the Columbia River navigation channel were reauthorized by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004. In accordance with the Act, "[t]he Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is directed to proceed with the construction of the Columbia River channel Improvements, Oregon and Washington, project in accordance with the Report of the Chief of Engineers, dated December 23, 1999[.]" In the 1999 Report, the Chief of Engineers recommended the deepening of the Columbia River channel to 43 feet and requested that a non-Federal sponsor assist the Government by making a suitable pipeline dredge available, calling out the Port of Portland and its dredge OREGON by name. The December 23, 1999 Chief of Engineers report specifically requires the use of the Port of Portland's dredge. USACE Portland District, in order to satisfy the Chief of Engineers' report, as adopted by Congress, must contract with the Port of Portland for dredging of the Columbia and Lower Willamette Rivers using the Port of Portland's pipeline dredge OREGON. As a result, only one responsible source exists and no other supplies or services will satisfy USACE agency requirements.</p>
<p>The requirement in the Columbia River system can only be accomplished by a pipeline dredge. A hopper dredge is unequipped to place the dredge material to the placement sites at the high production rate that is required in order to ensure commercial vessel navigation remains unrestricted. The Port of Portland is the only entity with a suitable pipeline dredge in the Columbia River System to perform the required dredging and is the only entity whose dredge is specified to fulfill this mission. Except for the Dredge OREGON, there are currently no other suitable alternative pipeline dredges based within the Columbia River system available to meet the Government's Columbia River navigational maintenance dredging needs. Any alternative suitable pipeline dredge would need to mobilize from outside the system, at a significant cost to the Government.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may submit a written capability statement or a written exception to the Government's intent to purchase on a sole source basis within 30 days of this notice. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Support information must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability of the vendor to provide pipeline dredging services able to meet USACE Portland District requirements in a satisfactory manner. Responsible sources must also show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this requirement would be advantageous to the Government. Vendors must include in their submission the following information: Company Name, Address, Business Size, CAGE Code and DUNS Number.</p>
<p>The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred for submissions in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responsible written responses are received within 30 days of this notice, the Government will proceed with a sole-source negotiated award. Responses may be emailed to David Boone, Contract Specialist, david.c.boone@usace.army.mil.</p>

BACKGROUND

<DESC><p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>CNIC Navy seeks to establish a contract to supply base theater concession operations. The contract is anticipated to supply the various military installation movie theater locations throughout the Navy CNIC Movie Program Worldwide Enterprise to include Marine Corps and Coast Guard installations. Through this contract Navy seeks to produce a more standardized selection of food and drink items and serving sizes, while realizing improved product distribution and cost savings via bulk purchasing for multiple sites (product items and the worldwide locations). <br /><br />Navy is open to a single contract award but recognizes the challenges of finding one source to provide all items to all locations. Therefore the awarding of multiple contracts based on locations and service products is anticipated as a possibility. The list of locations provided is organized by geographic regions. Interested parties are not bound to the location groupings. To that end we encourage interested parties to submit offers identifying any combination of the listed locations to be serviced and detailing the specific products to be provided for each location.</p>
<p><br />SCOPE:</p>
<p>CNIC requests the successful Contractors to deliver in timely fashion as designated in each order all specified food, condiments, and beverages adhering to highest quality standards and compliance at competitive market prices. <br />&bull; Manage the distribution and consolidation of authorized products, arrange for delivery per agreed schedule; <br />&bull; Cross reference CNIC movie theater concession stand specific product availability to Contractor current inventory, source additional products as required;<br />&bull; Provide established products and food items as ordered in the individual Task Order.<br />&bull; Each Proposer in preparing his/her proposal should consider all applicable laws and available industry guidelines as applicable to, liability, public health standards, recreational operations and the highest standards of quality of all equipment.</p>
<p>Federal agency customers are required to buy environmentally-friendly products whenever possible. Executive Order 13514 requires 95 percent of new contracts to contain recycled content and sustainable material</p>
<p>&emsp;The solicitation package is attached. This notice is a request for competitive proposals. CNIC will consider responses received by 3:30 P.M., Central on 30 October 2015. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to John.Wolfslau@navy.mil. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

<DESC>This agency proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) for add-on NSNs to the General Electric Aviation Systems Joint Opportunities Contract (JOC), SPE4A2-14-D-0001, a long-term strategic, sole source contract which will include multiple NSNs and FSCs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the General Electric Aviation Systems JOC, SPE4A2-14-D-0001, in accordance with the originally approved J&amp;A. However, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort.<br /><br />The proposed items are intended for addition to the existing sole source contract to General Electric Aviation Systems, SPE4A2-14-D-0001 for the following GEAS CAGEs: 07639, 35351 and 05624. A total of 33 NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. These items have been identified as sole source however some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. This is a Requirements Type Contract with a remaining base period of two (2) years out of three (3) years with two (2) three-year option periods for a total duration of nine (9) years period of performance. The contract requires supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB: Origin and Inspection/Acceptance: Origin to DLA Direct stock locations in accordance with the basic JOC. Subcontracting opportunities do exist for this effort.<br /><br />Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached lists of NSNs are the items that have been identified for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.<br /><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if any non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites will provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by August 3, 2015 and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil). The Government may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <P> This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for 1 each, DVB-S2 Modem. <P> 1.  Overview <P> The Space Communication and Navigation Testbed project requires a ground-based DVB-S2 modem to support experiments with variable and adaptive coding and modulation, applied to spacecraft telemetry and science data. The initial use of the modem will be for signal bandwidths of 5 MHz, but wider bandwidths of 200 MHz are desired for the second phase of the experiment. Operationally, the DVB-S2 modem will be used in a receive-only mode, to receive data from a NASA-provided transmit waveform (space-side). A DVB-S2 test modulator capability for the DVB-S2 modem is desired for loop-backing testing and self-test purposes. The DVB-S2 modem receiver is required to provide the required signal information (MODCOD, Eb/No) to support adaptive coding and modulation. This information will be used by a NASA-provided ground system to send ACM commands to the spacecraft. <P> 2.  Minimum Specifications: <P> 2.1   APPLICABLE STANDARDS <P> The DVB-S2 modem shall be compliant with the DVB-S2 standard ETSI EN 302 307-1 V1.4.1 (2014-11). <P> 2.2    WAVEFORM FEATURES <P> The DVB-S2 modem shall support the following: <P> User Data Rates:   0.5 Mbps to 225 Mbps, upgradable to approximately 900 Mbps <P> Symbol Rates:	1 to 50 MSymbols/s, upgradable to 200 MSymbols/s <P> Modulation:  QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-APSK, (32-APSK option) <P> Mode:  Constant Coding and Modulation (CCM), Variable Coding and Modulation (VCM), Support for Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) per section 2.9 <P> Pulse Shape Filter:  Square-Root Raised Cosine, Roll-off of 0.2, 0.25, 0.35 <P> Forward Error Correction (FEC):  BCH + LDPC, Rates: 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10 <P> FEC Block size:  Short (16,200 bits), Normal (64,800 bits) <P> 2.3   IF FREQUENCY The modem shall have an IF frequency range with covers at least 1.2 GHz to 2 GHz. <P> 2.4   DOPPLER ENVIRONMENT S-band Direct-to-Earth: The DVB-S2 receiver shall be capable of tracking a signal with a Doppler of +/- 50 kHz, at a worst case rate of 700 Hz/second. Ka-band Relay: The DVB-S2 receiver shall be capable of tracking a signal with a Doppler of +/- 535 kHz, at a worst case rate of 570 Hz/second. <P> 2.5   REMOTE CONTROL INTERFACE The DVB-S2 modem shall permit remote operation over a TCP/IP based network, from a NASA furnished Windows or Linux based client PC. The User Interface shall be graphical, and include real-time status information concerning the instrument configuration, test status / results, and health of the instrument (alarms, faults, and warnings). <P> 2.6   DATA INTERFACE The preferred data interface is gigabit Ethernet, 10/100/1000 Base-T. <P> 2.7   TRANSPORT STREAM DOCUMENTATION Documentation shall be provided which allows a NASA-provided DVB-S2 modulator to communicate with the DVB-S2 receiver, using the appropriate transport stream format (GSE or ULE). <P> 2.8   BASEBAND FRAME MODE The DVB-S2 modem shall have a raw baseband frame mode, bypassing any transport stream protocol. <P> 2.9   ADAPTIVE CODING AND MODULATION SUPPORT The DVB-S2 modem shall provide real-time metrics of the link condition, including the signal strength (Eb/No) and current MODCOD.

The Salem VAMC, is looking for a "qualified", boarded diagnostic medical physicist.  A "qualified" medical physicist is an individual who is certified by the American Board of Radiology, American Board of Medical Physics, American Board of Health Physics, or the Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine. The individual is to be Board Certified in Diagnostic Medical Physics.
 
1.	The physicist will work with the facility's RSO or his designee in the establishing and maintenance of a comprehensive  x-ray compliance safety program.  This program will adhere to the requirements and expectations of the Joint Commission, the VHA's NHPP (National Health Physics Program), the ACR and the internal requirements of the Salem VAMC. 
2.	The contractor shall perform an annual survey (not more than 14 months) of all diagnostic x-ray equipment in accordance of the Joint Commission and the ACR.  
3.	The physicist shall perform all work with his own equipment and shall provide a current certificate of calibration with the final report. 
4.	The contractor is expected to provide 2 copies of the physicist report to the RSO within 30 days of completion of the work.
5.	The Vendor will train Salem VA BioMed personnel in the proper methods of taking x-ray dose measurements.  The training will be performed using Salem VA equipment, assuming that the equipment meets regulatory standards for such work. 
6.	A system will be established between the contractor and the RSO, so that when a major repair is required on an x-ray unit or a replacement of a major certified component in between physicist visits, the Salem VA Biomed personnel will be able to perform the assessment and fax the data to the physicist for his review.  If the data if acceptable, the physicist shall sign off on the data and return to the Biomed department within 1 working day.  If the data is not acceptable, the physicist shall notify the BioMed personnel within 1 business day and either resolve the issue by phone or make reasonable arrangements to come on site to perform the assessment.  
7.	The contractor will review Biomed's personnel's measurement technique at least every other year. The physicist is to sign a statement of training for the Salem VA individuals who would be taking the x-ray dose measurements.
8.	The contractor will be available for consultation by phone and email for issues such as patient and staff radiation exposures, radiation safety issues, machine QA etc.  . 
9.	The contractor will assist in the review of CT protocols for optimization on at least a calendar year basis.  The contractor physicist will review the QA program for each CT unit on, at least, a calendar year basis. The contractor will perform dose measurements of up to 3 protocols per CT unit, selected by the facility's RSO or his designee, as bench mark references.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRE&#8208;SOLICITATION NOTICE</span></strong><br /><strong>Project:</strong> Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services for Phase 3 of the Expansion &amp; Reconfiguration Project at the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry (LPOE)<br /><strong>Solicitation No.: </strong>GS-09-P-16-KT-C-7000<br /><strong>Region:</strong> GSA, PBS, Design &amp; Construction Div., Pacific Rim Region (R9)<br /><strong>Location:</strong> San Diego, California<br /><strong>Budget:</strong> Estimated total contract cost is between $135,000,000 and $145,000,000.<br /><strong>Total Contract Duration:</strong> Forty (40) months<br /><strong>Contracting Officer:</strong> Christopher Lee<br /><strong>Contact info:</strong> (415)522&#8208;2877, christopher.lee@gsa.gov
<p><strong>PURPOSE</strong><br />The purpose of this pre&#8208;solicitation notice is to formally announce the General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Design &amp; Construction Division's (9PC) requirement to procure the services of a highly qualified Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) to successfully complete Phase 3 of the overall Expansion &amp; Reconfiguration Project at the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry (LPOE). The design for Phase 3 has already been completed and will be used as the basis for the project.  The CMc scope of work includes all labor and materials required to provide architectural, engineering, construction, and other related services necessary to successfully complete the project in compliance with all applicable codes.  Given the size, complexity, uniqueness, and overall importance both politically and locally the CMc contractor must have the capability and experience to meet all of the GSA's contract requirements.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong><br />The San Ysidro Land Port of Entry (LPOE) is the busiest land port in the world.  The 30-year-old outdated facility can no longer support nor enforce the missions of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  The LPOE processes approximately an average of 50,000 northbound vehicles and 25,000 northbound pedestrians per day.  The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) predicts an increase in vehicle traffic at San Ysidro of up to 70% by the year 2030.  SANDAG's studies indicate a substantial economic impact of roughly $8.4 billion in lost revenue to the region resulting from increased wait times at the border. Given the delays at current traffic volumes, capacity of the LPOE must be increased to accommodate regional growth.</p>
<p>To address these growing concerns the LPOE is undergoing a three (3) phase Expansion &amp; Reconfiguration Project estimated to cost over $500M.  This construction contract will provide the required services to successfully construct Phase 3 of the overall project.  Phase 3 contains, but is not limited to, the following primary construction project elements:</p>
<p>&bull;	Widening of the southbound Interstate-5 roadway from the current five (5) to ten (10) lanes, fabrication/installation of the ten (10) new southbound inspection booths, and re-routing of the new roadway to align with Mexico's El Chaparral inspection facilities.</p>
<p>&bull;	Construction of new southbound primary and secondary vehicle inspection canopies, a southbound headhouse building, an employee parking structure with a tunnel connecting to the northbound headhouse building, and access roadways through the LPOE to and from Mexico.</p>
<p>&bull;	Expansion of the northbound primary vehicle inspection canopy, the northbound vehicle secondary inspection areas, the northbound primary vehicle inspection with eight (8) additional lanes (including the fabrication/installation of the associated fifteen (15) northbound inspection booths), and the expansion of the Narcotics Building.</p>
<p>&bull;	Associated roadways and tunnels to these new facilities within the Land Port of Entry</p>
<p>The total contract duration for Phase 3 is estimated to be forty (40) months after award by the GSA Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The total cost estimated for this contract is between $135,000,000 and $145,000,000.</p>
<p><strong>ACQUISITION STRATEGY</strong><br />This procurement will be a single stage, Full &amp; Open competitive source selection utilizing the tradeoff process to award a construction contract.  This source selection is based on Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation and Part 36 Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts.  Proposal evaluation and the steps leading to the award of the contract will be in accordance with FAR 15.305 through 15.308.  The evaluation process will result in selection of the proposal that represents the best value to the Government in terms of technical and price factors which will be identified in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The current procurement schedule anticipates a contract award in February 2016 however that is subject to change should the GSA deem necessary.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

With staff trained on both products, they have the ability to cross reference both products.  Only one other product is comparable, Elsevier's Mosby Nursing Skills which we already have, which the Library Network Office is now supplying to all VA facilities.  A major reason why our nursing staff wants to stay with Lippincott is the time saved by knowing, accepting and approving the 1400 "Lippincott Standard Procedures" list.  This approved list allows nursing staff to take expert care of patients at the bedside immediately.  
Procedures and Advisor is a point-of-care database.  The content creation is evidenced-based, peer-reviewed, and current.  Procedures offers a full series of behavioral health procedures.  Procedures are updated annually.  All procedures have the evidence-based references cited at the end of the procedure.  Multiple references are used versus only on textbook source like Mosby's.  Procedures offers a full election in all the specialty areas needed to practice in a hospital setting.  User testing demonstrates that the name of LWW sections and the tabs used to navigate LWW product are very user-friendly and intuitive.  Procedures clearly focuses on quick point of care access by helping the nurse get in, get the information he/she needs, and get out without a lot of unnecessary scanning which is detrimental to the care of the patient.  The procedure view in Procedures can be customized based on the elements the customer want to view or print (i.e. equipment, implementation, etc.).  Procedures offers quicker and more accurate searching with advanced search functionality.  Since this is a point-of-care; evidence based database it helps nurses and other clinical staff make life and death decisions with the patient population.  Lippincott has also partnered with Joint Commission Resources publishing group who will help edit specific Lippincott Nursing Solution content as this is not the case with Mosby.

(a) Method of payment.
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either-
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the SAM database. 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210. 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for-
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and-
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. 
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. 
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the SAM database.

<NTYPE>SNOTE
<CONTACT>APG APBI Team, Email usarmy.apg.cecom.mbx.apbi-registration@mail.mil
<DESC><p>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND ADVANCED PLANNING BRIEFING TO INDUSTRY</p>
<p>Synopsis: Team Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) will conduct the fourth annual Advanced Planning Briefing to Industry on November 3-5, 2015 at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD. The goal of the event is to provide the industrial base with networking opportunities and information on upcoming and long term potential contracting opportunities for mission areas that focus on: Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Research and Development (R&amp;D); Chemical/Biological Defense (CBD). The APBI will present potential contracting opportunities that are closely aligned with the technology roadmaps of each respective organization, specifically focusing on Fiscal Years' 2016 and 2017 opportunities. Slides containing this information will be posted electronically following the APBI event. The government will not hear formal bids from industry as the purpose of the APBI is only for the government to brief upcoming opportunities to industry.</p>
<p>As the Army strives to provide optimal support and capabilities with limited funds and resources, the ability to receive industry's input and innovation through avenues such as the APBI is crucial. With new technologies rapidly emerging in the commercial environment, this exchange of information will continue to advance solutions, ideas, capabilities and efficiencies. Team APG is aware of the challenges faced by small businesses and has worked to encourage their participation. The agility and innovation small businesses bring to the Army will help shape future development efforts, leverage competition and create new solutions.</p>
<p>PLACES: <br />Myer Auditorium, Building 6000, C4ISR Campus, APG North, MD (All day 3-4 Nov)<br />Building E4516: The Chemical Demilitarization Training Facility, APG (Edgewood Area), MD (5 Nov Only)</p>

<DESC>SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT - OCTOBER 5, 2015
<p>In conjunction with the recent Sources Sought posting and release of the Enterprise Training Services Contract (ETSC) DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS), the Government will host one-on-one sessions to allow industry to convey company information and to discuss questions, comments and recommendations regarding the ETSC requirements.</p>
<p>This event window will be held during the weeks of 19-23 and 26-30 October, 2015, Eastern Standard Time, at the Tech Point II Building located at 3051 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3256 (Also known as the Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS)).</p>
<p>The Government requests that only those parties seriously considering competing as a prime contractor reply to establish a date/time slot for this event. Requests will be scheduled on a first-come first-serve basis. The following sample represents the daily schedule for this event.</p>
<p>Monday, October 19, 2015<br />SLOT 1 - 0900-0945 <br />SLOT 2 - 1000-1045 <br />SLOT 3 - 1100-1145 <br />LUNCH - 1145-1300<br />SLOT 4 - 1300-1345 <br />SLOT 5 - 1400-1445<br />SLOT 6 - 1500-1545</p>
<p>Interested parties shall submit their requests via email to the Government POC identified below no later than 14 October 2014. Requests attempted by telephone will not be accepted. Requests must clearly identify the following:</p>
<p>1. Name of the company/companies attending; <br />2. Primary and alternate dates/times desired; <br />3. Names of all individuals planning to attend, along with their official business titles;<br />4. Contact information of the company employee(s) responsible for coordinating the event. <br />5. Specify whether the session will be face-to-face or via teleconference.</p>
<p>The Government cannot guarantee that every party will receive its desired primary/alternate time slots but every effort will be made to accommodate requests. Unfortunately, due to the accelerated timeframe of this event and the limited resources available, if a party must cancel its session, the Government will be unable to reschedule unless there are unfilled date/time slots available.</p>
<p>Sessions will not exceed forty-five minutes in length. If teaming arrangements have been made and the team wishes to consolidate its one-on-one sessions, they may do so but will not be allowed more than the forty-five minute time period. Due to this time constraint, it is recommended that each party formulate its questions/comments/recommendations in advance and provide an electronic copy to the Government point of contact (POC) no later than seventy-two hours prior to their designated time slot. The Government cannot guarantee that it will be capable of providing a response to any and all of the provided questions/comments/recommendations prior to the discussion.<br /><br />The Government recommends interested parties participate face-to-face; however, we understand the geographical limitations that may impede some parties from attending in person. Accordingly, the Government will allow parties to conduct sessions via teleconference. The Government will provide a call-in number as needed to accommodate scheduled teleconferences.</p>
<p>In addition, all attendees are requested to adhere to the following ETSC One-on-One Rules of Engagement:</p>
<p>1. Attendees must arrive in person no later than five minutes prior to their allotted time and must wait at the main entrance to be escorted by a Government representative into the building. If participating via teleconference, callers must connect by the allotted start time using the provided call-in number. No additional time will be afforded to those parties unable to arrive or call on time.<br />2. Please limit the number of attendees to no more than four individuals, this includes those parties wishing to attend as a team with other industry partners. Callers are expected to adhere to this limitation as well.<br />3. Do not expect the Government to validate, or provide recommended solutions to its requirements.<br />4. All information provided by the Government is based on the best information available and is subject to modification and is in no way binding on the Government.<br />5. Attendees must be US Citizens or permanent resident aliens.</p>

<DESC>This agency proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) for add-on NSNs to the General Electric Aviation Systems Joint Opportunities Contract (JOC), SPE4A2-14-D-0001, a long-term strategic, sole source contract which will include multiple NSNs and FSCs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the General Electric Aviation Systems JOC, SPE4A2-14-D-0001, in accordance with the originally approved J&amp;A. However, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort.<br /><br />The proposed items are intended for addition to the existing sole source contract to General Electric Aviation Systems, SPE4A2-14-D-0001 for the following GEAS CAGEs: 07639, 35351 and 05624. A total of eight (8) NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. These items have been identified as sole source however some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. This is an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) with a remaining base period of two (2) years out of three (3) years with two (2) three-year option periods for a total duration of nine (9) years period of performance. The contract requires supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB: Origin and Inspection/Acceptance: Origin DLA Direct stock locations in accordance with the basic JOC. Subcontracting opportunities do exist for this effort. <br /><br />Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached lists of NSNs are the items that have been identified for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.<br /><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if any non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites will provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by October 20, 2015 and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil). The Government may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the Government.<br /><br />*This amendment is to correct the response date to October 20, 2015.<br />

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   Period of Performance: 10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.

Proprietary knowledge and information is required in order to properly maintain, repair, and certify the systems in service at our facility. In addition,  the software run on the units are proprietary to GE. Only GE Healthcare can perform the required maintenance and repairs on this equipment.	
     	
	

1	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
Equipment is proprietary and can only be serviced by GE at this time. 	
Existing equipment is GE brand, which requires the GE company to service and maintain per VA and FSS contract V797P-6019B.	

1	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
We may require a direct replacement part which will be covered under this new task order contract.

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	
     	


1	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
This is a follow-up contract to V797P-6019B.	
     	


0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	
     	




(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  

GE Healthcare is the original equipment manufacturer and is the only source that possesses proprietary knowledge necessary to properly conduct preventive maintenance and repairs of the equipment  in service. Furthermore, replacements parts need to be original parts from the manufacturer, which is in a position to offer a discount on parts not covered by the maintenance agreement.	
The service contract costs for this equipment have been negotiated and a FSS contract has been established for this work. The FSS contract number is V797P-6019B. The price has been determined to be fair and reasonable based on established NAC FSS pricing. If we were to compete this it would require replacing all equipment which could not be recovered through competition which makes this the Best Value.  Maintenance and repair provided by another contractor would void the warranty.	

 (6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
     	
No further market research was conducted once it was determined that the original equipment manufacturer was the only source that possesses proprietary information necessary to properly repair and maintain the equipment for service. The Contracting Officer's Representative has contacted the vendor and received the appropriate quote.	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
     	
     	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
In the future, we will conduct market research to determine if there are any updates to the FSS contract.
     	


(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.

These items will be delivered in accordance with the delivery schedule outlined for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
The ID-micro Typing System manufactured by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostic System and the Ortho ProVue instrument are currently in use in the laboratory.  These reagents, solvents and supplies are proprietary to the equipment utilized.  
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  Ortho Clinical Diagnostics is the manufacturer of the equipment utilized and they require only Ortho Clinical reagents be used with this equipment.  If we used other supplier reagents, solvents and supplies it would void the warranty on the equipment and tamper with the results of the tests.  Ortho Clinical has no distributors that can provide the requirement.


5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market Research was conducted and confirmed that the reagents are proprietary to the equipment and no other vendor can supply the requested reagents.


6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

The supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source. <br />(2) (iii) For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in--<br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br />(1) Facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. <br />The State of Wyoming awarded an A&amp;E contract #13063327702 with Vogt Construction Engineering, LLC on 15 Nov 2012 that included a $196,594.00 for the Apron Rehabilitation Design. The design was completed but did not include UFGS specifications, and it also needed to be updated. It would not make sense to have another company do the update because they would have to re-validate all of the work that was already accomplished in the $196,594.00 project. Since Vogt did the original project it will only cost $57,471.00 to include the UFGS specifications and to update the project. I consider this a follow-on contract action. <br />(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.<br />The Wyoming Air National Guard needed a previous design updated prior to asking for funds to perform the construction project. The original contract #13063327702 with Vogt Construction Engineering, LLC on 15 Nov 2012 that included a $196,594.00 for the Apron Rehabilitation Design needed to be updated and needed to include the UFGS specifications required for Air Force airfields. We awarded a sole source contract to Vogt Construction LLC for the update because they designed the original project so they would not have to re-verify all the work that was accomplished in that design and were already intimately aware of the previous design and the area that needed to be updated.<br />(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).<br />Scope of Work for Apron Rehabilitation/Reconstruction - Project 2 Update Wyoming Air National Guard<br />Cheyenne Airport <br />DPEZ102007 REPAIR APRON</p>
<p>This project consists of:<br />Project #2 Update - Revise and Repackage Design Documents</p>
<p>The current design documents for the apron expansion and reconstruction work are essentially packaged into three separate construction schedules. Those three are as follows:<br />&bull; Project 1: A best-case apron expansion, approximately 20,300 SY<br />&bull; Project 2: Reconstruction of approximately 10,800 SY of existing apron<br />&bull; Project 4: A reduced-size apron expansion, approximately 3,400 SY</p>
<p>Presently, Project 1 and 2 are bound as one set of construction documents. The scope of work described in this attachment separates Project 2 from Project 1 so that Project 2 will serve as a stand-alone construction project complete with its own construction plans and specifications.</p>
<p>Additionally, the scope described below updates the plans and specifications for Project<br />2. This update is necessary to reflect the changes requested during Guard review.</p>
<p>The design and supporting design documents including construction plans, design report and construction specifications will be revised as described below:</p>
<p>1. Replace FAA specs with equivalent UFGS specifications (where UFGS specs don't exist, "special" specifications will be developed).<br />2. Replace the ETL 97-5 spec with the current UFGS specification for concrete pavement.<br />3. Update any plan sheet details that reference FAA specs to reference the appropriate UFGS and/or "Special" specification.<br />4. Modify Details 7 &amp; 8/Sheet 14 and Details 2, 3 &amp; 4/Sheet 26 to remove the &frac14;" bevel at the top of the sawcut joint.<br />5. Add notes to Details 7 &amp; 8/Sheet 14 and Details 2, 3 &amp; 4/Sheet 26 referencing manufacturers recommended depth: width ratio for the silicon joint sealants.<br />6. Prepare report discussing the pros/cons of sealing the HMA/PCC joint along the perimeter of the apron with silicone joint sealant, versus using hot applied bituminous sealant.<br />7. Prepare report that includes a risk analysis of the proposed concrete mill and overlay versus full depth reconstruction.<br />8. Provide separate bid package (plans and specs) for Project 2 (Apron Reconstruction - 10,800 SY).<br />9. Participate in teleconference calls to discuss 65%, 95% and 100% design.<br /><br />Type A Services, Preliminary Design<br />Activities include:</p>
<p>1. Pre-design conference and prep<br />2. Concept Development Meeting &amp; preparation<br />3. Review and assess comments from ANG.</p>
<p>Type B Services, Design<br />Activities include:</p>
<p>Type B Services, Phase I, 65%</p>
<p>1. Pavement section design report discussion<br />2. Update plans<br />3. Update technical specifications<br />4. Update design report<br />5.

<p><br />(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.<br />Authority Cited: Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1). The supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source. <br />(2) (iii) For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in--<br />(2) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br />(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br />The supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source. Vogt Construction Engineering was selected as the original firm to conduct the initial design for the Apron Rehabilitation Design and a contract in the amount of $196,594.00 was awarded to them based upon their specialty in working on airfield projects. To have anyone else come in and update the current design would require them to re-validate all of the work that was done in the original design which would result in an additional cost and re-duplicate the effort that was already accomplished in the original design by Vogt. <br />(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.<br />The contract action is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.<br />(7) The anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable<br />(8) A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.<br />Market research was conducted and it was determined that Vogt was the most logical choice because they designed the original project and would not have to re-validate all of the work that was done on the initial project.</p>
<p>(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:<br />If another A&amp;E firm was contracted to do this work the estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated is $200,000, more than three times the estimate of Vogt's update. This estimate was arrived at by estimating the number of hours an engineering firm would have to spend to re-validate the original design and then multiplying that times the average cost of an A&amp;E engineer in this specialty area $180 per hour. <br />(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. N/A<br />(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. N/A<br />(12) I certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<ARCHDATE>10102015
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY
(Justification Approved September 23, 2015; Task Order awarded September 25, 2015)

1.	Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs
Office of Acquisition Operations
Strategic Acquisition Center- Frederick
321 Ballenger Center Drive, Suite 125
Frederick, MD 21703

2.	Action Being Approved:  This justification is for a one-year, sole source, labor hour task order against the Services for Program Excellence and Corporate TRansformation Umbrella (SPECTRUM) contract VA798-11-D-0122 with Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) for professional engineering program and project management support for a vast portfolio of projects and initiatives within the Office of Capital Asset Management, Engineering Support. 

3.	Description of the Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is to provide professional services to assist the Office of Capital Asset Management, Engineering, and Support (OCAMES) with the engineering/facility management programs at VA Central Office (VACO), and across VHA, in all associated owned and leased VHA facilities.  OCAMES requires a cadre of contractor professionals with third-party objectivity and credibility ready to respond to short notice tasks, such as developing administration-wide guidance and action plans; facilitating task forces and working groups; providing training; performing analyses to include staffing evaluations and surveys; designing and planning program enhancements and initiatives; managing projects; briefing Leadership; cost estimating, and assessing compliance.

Work will include the SPECTRUM task area of Studies and Analysis, Program and Project Management Support, Management Analyses, Policy Support, Strategic Planning and Performance Measurement, Training, Business Process Reengineering, Business Process Improvement, Business Process Management, Quality Management, and Change Management and Transition.  The work requires an On-site Project Manager, a Program Analyst, a Management Analyst, a Facilitator, an Editor, a Technical Writer, Administrative Support, Subject Matter Expertise, document development for publication (including reproduction), and travel as necessary and approved.

The estimated value of the acquisition, based on historical data from the previous task order, is $990,496.00 for one year of performance.  Since this will be a labor hour task order, the task order will include a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.  The current task order, VA798-11-D-0122 VA119A-14-J-0449, expires on September 29, 2015.  This task order will have a period of performance of September 30, 2015, to September 29, 2016.

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C.  4106(c)(3), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), entitled "The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order." 




5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:

The work required under the next task order is a continuation of activities currently performed under the existing (previously competed) task order. Issuing a logical follow-on order to the previously competed order will avoid disruption of service, duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered through competition, transition delays, and increased costs and therefor is in the interest of economy and efficiency. Using a logical follow-on to continue the OCAMES support services, while separating and competing the specific initiatives that are now in the development phase upon logical follow-on completion, results in the highest likelihood of success and lowest program risk. 
The Contractor is currently engaged in a number of high impact "projects" which require development, sequencing, and evolution over a prolonged time period which is projected to exceed the current task order end date.  For example: the Contractor is tasked with development of a fully integrated SharePoint site for all of OCAMES involving a multitude of service specific "pages," templates, and database repositories for which some requirements/interfaces are dependent upon completion of VA's new "shared services" model ("shared services" outputs are expected to be finalized in late 2015).  Currently, the Program Office utilizes two different and obsolete web-sites for which support and hosting will end in fall of 2015.  Any lapse would be unacceptable due to resulting negative operational and capital project support and monitoring impacts.  Utilization of an alternate contractor unfamiliar with direction and work requirements would result in completion delays, avoidable transition issues, productivity loses (with resulting economic costs) and an increased risk of additional service lapses. Following the current work with a one-year logical follow on will allow the Government to recognize resulting efficiencies.

The contractor personnel provide management support in the area of correspondence management, which has been instrumental in addressing the Program Office's backlog and gains toward meeting SECVA's expectations. Continuity is vital in avoiding any progress set-backs until all correspondence backlogs are resolved.

6.	Fair and Reasonable Cost:  See the "Justification Signatures" section of this document for the Contracting Officer's determination that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

7.	Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  The SPECTRUM Base IDIQ Performance Work Statement (PWS) provides in section 8, Task Order Proposal Request (TOPR) Procedures, paragraph (a)2c that Awardees will not be given a fair opportunity to be considered for task order which are expected to exceed $3,000 when the CO determines that:
	
 
The order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to a task order already issued under the contract, provided that all Awardees were given fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.  For the purposes of this solicitation the CO may negotiate a sole source logical follow-on task order with the current contractor providing previously competed services. In the event an increase in the amount of previously competed services is required by the Government, the CO may negotiate a sole source logical follow-on task order with the current contractor provided the required additional services do not represent more than one full time equivalent position or 20% of the total competed labor hours on the entire task order, whichever is greater.  When deciding whether to negotiate a sole source logical follow-on task order with the current contractor, consideration will be given to the contractor's past performance, continuity of services, and price.
The previous task order for these services was competed among all SPECTRUM IDIQ contract holders by issuing the TOPR and providing fair opportunity to all six SPECTRUM contractors.  Three quotes were received in response to the solicitation and, of these, only BAH provided a quotation that provided key personnel acceptable in terms of the specific engineering and facilities management activities required under the task order PWS.  Given the nature of the work, these personnel are essential to program success.  As the work is anticipated to be a continuation of the current efforts, the Government does not anticipate that the services will represent an increase of more than one full time equivalent position or 20% of the total competed labor hours on the entire task order.  At the same time, the Government anticipates that a competition for the same services on SPECTRUM would: 1) be disruptive to those projects in progress, and 2) yield the same competitive outcome. 

Past Performance:  BAH has provided support to over a dozen OCAMES projects throughout the task order period.  BAH has demonstrated the in-depth expertise to handle the breadth of all required tasks; including "short fuse" and high visibility projects.  Tasks have been completed timely with high quality deliverables.  Overall, OCAMES finds BAH key personnel meet the task order requirements in terms of required skills, and deliverables have met and exceeded task order requirements. Overall performance is noted as excellent as this time.

The logical follow on order value, at less than $1M, is within the remaining SPECTRUM ceiling.

8.	Actions to Remove Barriers to Competition:  Several OCAMES initiatives are in the developmental phase with a full scope of work for the next contract left to be determined.  As the breadth and specific requirements of these initiatives are fully developed with historical data, including benchmarks and trends, OCAMES will have a basis to estimate future workload requirements to maintain an acceptable level of performance in later contracts.
While the Government does not anticipate a single competition next year for these same services, the specific initiatives that are now in the developmental phase will likely take shape as separately competed requirements following this task order. 
In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D)(1), the Government will publish a notice within 14 days of award on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) and the justification will be posted and made publicly available for a minimum of 30 days.
