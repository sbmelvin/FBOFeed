<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR Part 13) with Medtronic, 710 Medtronic Pkwy, Minneapolis, MN 55432, as the only responsible source that can provide a neurologic stereotactic navigation system that can replace the current system from this company.  This is the only neurologic navigation system that is compatible with the Medtronic O-arm currently at the facility. This is the only system that allows for frameless deep brain stimulation via their proprietary software which allows for increased patient comfort during a life threatening procedure.  This is the only system with the AxIEM system, which is the industry's only electromagnetic option for neuro-navigation. This technology is new and allows the doctor to track the tip of the instrument (catheter) instead of just targeting the navigation spot of interest as with all other navigation systems on the market.  
Regulatory Requirements:  The system and all of the components, shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.
This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures FAR Part 13 under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  There are not set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The intended procurement will be classified under North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product.  All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Brian Miller at brian.miller4@med.navy.mil no later than June 8, 2010.  Phone calls will not be accepted.

<DESC><p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of adaptive, high performance military systems. As the demands on military platforms and buildings increase, so does the need for materials that can mitigate the shock and vibrations applied by dynamic environments. Today's materials exhibit limited adaptability and typically achieve only extreme stiffness. The Material Logic program seeks to enable material systems that adapt to varying loads and simultaneously exhibit both high stiffness and high damping. By demonstrating the ability to combine stiffness, damping, and adaptive dynamic range in a single material, the Material Logic program will enable the design of military platforms, and buildings with the ability to continually change their properties to match the demands of an ever evolving environment.</p>

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for three additional tests to the Space Shuttle ExternalTank Aerothermodynamic Ground Testing and Data Analysis.  The additional tests will beadded to an existing Purchase Order, NNJ10HB81P.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center(CUBRC).  CUBRC will modify an existing test model with very small and densely spacedinstrumentation to measure heat transfer rates.  This will require machining and uniqueminiature delicate instrumentation to be added to the model.  This dense instrumentationis required in order to capture fluid dynamic effects resulting from the interactionbetween the Orbiter, external tank, and solid rocket boosters.	The Space Shuttle programrequires this level of instrumentation in order to capture potentially strong gradientsinduced by fluid dynamic effects on the high fidelity geometry of the Shuttle Orbiter,Solid Rocket Booster (SRB), and External Tank. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to Lamar Mueller at perry.L.mueller@nasa.gov not later than 4:30 p.m.local time on May 31, 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERY--This notice is provided for information purposes only.	NASA LaRC intendsto issue a firm-fixed price contract to Wyle Laboratories, Inc. entitled Sonic BoomFocusing.  This competitive action will be funded by the American Reinvestment andRecovery Act (ARRA). This award results from a competitive selection under the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters released NASA ResearchAnnouncement (NRA) for foundational research in support of the Aeronautics ResearchMission Directorate (ARMD), entitled "Research Opportunities in Aeronautics (ROA) 2009under NNH09ZEA001N, Amendment 4, A.4 Supersonics Project (SUP1) (Recovery Act Funds) Sonic Boom Modeling.   The Supersonics Project is aligned with the Aeronautics ResearchMission Directorate (ARMD) principles of maintaining intellectual stewardship ofaeronautical core competencies for the nation in supersonic flight technologies andresearch appropriate to NASAs unique capabilities.  The Project supports the FundamentalAeronautics Program strategy of developing systems level multidisciplinary capabilities(e.g., airframe design, engine design, airspace modeling and simulation) for supersoniccivilian and military applications.  The Supersonics Project is a broad-based effortdesigned to develop knowledge, capabilities and technologies that support vehicles thatfly supersonic by eliminating the efficiency, environmental and performance barriers topractical supersonic cruise vehicles. The Project has identified a set of key TechnicalChallenges that are barriers to success for this vehicle type.	This effort will addressthe Sonic Boom Modeling Technical Challenge.Successful supersonic civil aircraft must be capable of supersonic flight over land.However, the sonic boom that occurs when aircraft travel at speeds greater than sound isperhaps the most significant environmental barrier to supersonic commercial flight.  Inthe near term, the Supersonics project is emphasizing understanding and overcoming thisbarrier, both through the development of approaches to reducing sonic boom noise andimproving understanding of the impact of these reduced noise booms.The Supersonics Project is developing technologies that potentially will lower a sonicboom to levels acceptable to the general community.  There is very little data on theeffects of such booms, and the project therefore has adopted a three-pronged approach tostudying the atmospheric effects, transmission into structures (living area of a typicalresidence and a large multi-cubical office environment), and human reaction to thesebooms. The Projects goal is to develop software to accurately predict the location andintensity of these focused sonic booms to help design new supersonic aircraft that willbe acceptably quiet for overland operation.  This effort will seek validation of newsoftware codes by comparison to measurements of actual focused sonic booms, refinementfor best performance, and then assessment for their use with future quiet supersonicaircraft designs (also called low-boom aircraft). The referenced solicitation is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 35.016 andNFS 1835.016. Additional information regarding the 2009 ROA solicitation can be found athttp://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method  =init&solId={8AA62753-0F6B-3791-4A43-3DEF562FA257}&path=open (ROA-2009 CompleteSolicitation as of November 24, 2009).

<DESC>Recovery  This notice is provided for information purposes only.  NASA LaRCintends to issue a fixed-price contract to Kestrel Technologies, LLC entitled A SafetyCase Workbench.  This competitive action will be funded by the American Reinvestment andRecovery Act (ARRA). This award results from a competitive selection under the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters released NASA ResearchAnnouncement (NRA) for foundational research in support of the Aeronautics ResearchMission Directorate ARMD), entitled "Research Opportunities in Aeronautics (ROA) 2009under NNH09ZEA001N, Amendment 7, B.6 Verification and Validation of Flight CriticalSystems.  The goal of the Verification and Validation of Flight-Critical Systems (VVFCS)project is to develop multidisciplinary verification and validation tools and techniquesthat advance safety assurance and certification of complex, networked, distributed flightcritical systems. Here flight critical systems are defined to be any system that directlycontrols the safe conduct of an aircrafts flight. This includes air and ground systems,concepts of operation as well as technology, and recognizes that human performance is akey factor in flight-critical systems and must be accounted for.  The increasingcomplexity of flight critical systems proposed for the Next Generation Air TransportationSystem (NextGen) will require new paradigms and real-time distributed systeminfrastructures providing high levels of confidence and safety assurances. The cost ofproving a flight-critical system is safe is often expected to far surpass the costs for other aspects of design and implementation.In this effort, the Contractor will develop a prototype of a safety case tool in the formof a workbench.  Similar to a craftsmens workbench, this virtual workbench willprovide the safety case practitioner with a set of tools, or modules, from which he orshe can plan, capture, analyze, and maintain safety cases.   The workbench modules will capture specific elements of a safety case (arguments, claims,evidence  including probabilistic evidence); will support infrastructure tasks, such asthe means to maintain historical data; and will support safety case planning and resourceestimation.  Also, the Contractor will document a workbench Application Program Interface(API) to facilitate data exchange between the workbench modules and other tools.    At the conclusion of this effort the Contractor will have completed a prototype of thesafety case workbench, a prototype and at least one refinement of each module, and willhave documented the workbench API.  The contractor will also have demonstrated thecapabilities of the workbench across all modules through the use of a comprehensive unittest framework, and will have demonstrated the use of the API through an exampleinterface with at least one external analytical tool.The referenced solicitation is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 35.016 andNFS 1835.016. Additional information regarding the 2009 ROA solicitation can be found athttp://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method =init&solId={8AA62753-0F6B-3791-4A43-3DEF562FA257}&path=open (ROA-2009 CompleteSolicitation as of November 24, 2009).

GOVPAY
GOVPAY ELECTRONIC INVOICINGAll payment requests must be submitted electronically through GovPay.  "Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment by a contractor. To constitute a proper invoice, the GovPay payment request must conform to the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Payment Documentation and Process" and FAR 52.232-25, "Prompt Payment (OCT 2008)". To ensure the timely processing of invoices GovPay uses an automated "workflow" process to route invoices for review, approvals and payment; as required by the "Prompt Payment Act". Detailed GovPay information for use of GovPay may be obtained on the Internet at www.govpay.gov.  This web site includes user manuals, training resources, instructions for registration and contact information for the GovPay help desk for additional support.  All users can access reports on the status of their invoices. Supporting documentation shall be attached to the GovPay invoice in the form of "flat files" in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and an Adobe PDF file.  There is a 15MB limitation on file size for these attachments, per header or line item.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are NOT acceptable electronic forms for payment requests.   GovPay uses the contractor information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as one of the components for validating contractor registration.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit accurate and current CCR information.  Failure to register and maintain CCR information, or if it has expired, been suspended, been deleted, or could not be found, will result in rejection of your invoice.  An invoice submitted during the period for which information in the CCR could not be verified must be resubmitted for payment after successfully registering or updating registration in CCR.  Contractors are encouraged to review their CCR information to ensure the most current information is available for GovPay. The CCR Assistance Center is available to provide assistance and answer questions.  They can be reached at 1-888-227-2423 or on the web at http://www.ccr.gov. [End of clause]

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Governments intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from CACI Systems, Inc. (CACI),  14370 Newbrook Drive, Chantilly, VA 20151-2218 for 384,000 manhours  and associated Travel and Materials  that will provide  continued research, rapid design, development, integration, installation, test and evaluation, fielding, analysis, maintenance, training and logistics support  for  Navy, Army, Air Force, Special  Operations Forces, Joint Services, Federal Agencies, Counterdrug and other agencies Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems and sub-systems. These systems are employed within user locations or platforms including shipboard, aircraft/airborne, weapon systems, on small crafts, boats, shelters or vehicles.  The technical services are currently being performed by CACI under contract N00421-06-C-0074.  This acquisition will result in the modification of existing CACI contract N00421-06-C-0074 by increasing the current Option IV estimated labor and cost ceiling through the establishment of a new CLIN set with a performance period of 16 April 2010 through 15 April 2011.    This directed procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of contract ceiling by 15 April 2010, approximately six months early due to an increase in project requirements.  The proposed additional level of effort is needed for continuing the numerous on-going projects currently being done under Contract N00421-06-C-0074 while the follow-on action is being competed.  Awarding to any contractor other than CACI would result in unacceptable delays in completing or continuing tasks, such as the program requirements for Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication Systems (JWICS), National Guard Bureau (MGB), Unified Command Suite (UCS), Marine Corp Central Command (MARCENT), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), United States Marshall Services (USMS) and Joint Mobile Intelligence Communication Systems (JMICS). These services are nonseverable as no other firm can provide the corporate capabilities, intergrated program support, technical expertise and resources needed to effectively meet the requirements of these programs.  CACI is the only source available that can meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW) in the short time period (one-year) between the exhaustion of the current Option Year IV ceiling under, Contract N00421-06-C-0074 estimated at 16 April 2010 and the follow-on contract due to be awarded 15 April 2011.  Due to the on-going nature of the projects currently being done under Contract N00421-06-C-0074 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, CACI is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a follow-on contract.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETIVE PROPOSALS.  However, responsible interested parties may submit a capabilities statement in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all information received by  19 February 2010, 1530 EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  For information contact Theresa Newbold, Code 2.5.1.2.2.3, Telephone (301) 342-9921, FAX (301) 757-2276 or via email: theresa.newbold@navy.mil.

The technical services are currently being performed by BAH under contract N00421-09-C-0016.  This acquisition will result in the modification of existing BAH contract N00421-09-C-0016 by adding a cost plus fixed-fee level of effort Option II with a performance period of approximately one year that will run from 16 April 2010 through 15 April 2011.    This directed procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of contract ceiling by 15 April 2010, approximately six months early due to an increase in project requirements.  The proposed additional one year option is needed for continuing on-going projects currently being done under Contract N00421-09-C-0016 while the follow-on action is being competed.  Awarding to any contractor other than BAH would result in unacceptable delays in completing or continuing tasks, such as the program requirements for United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), the Marine Corps Distance Learning (MCDL), the United States Marshall's Service (USMS) and the United States Capitol Police (USCP) efforts.  These services are nonseverable as no other firm can provide the corporate capabilities, intergrated program support, technical expertise and resources needed to effectively meet the requirements of these programs.  BAH is the only source available that can meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW) in the short time period (one-year) between the exhaustion of the current Option Year I under, Contract N00421-09-C-0016 which expires 16 April 2010 and the follow-on contract due to be awarded 16 April 2011.  Due to the on-going nature of the projects currently being done under Contract N00421-09-C-0016 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, BAH is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a follow-on contract.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETIVE PROPOSALS.  However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all information received by 12 February 2010, 1530 EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  For information contact Theresa Newbold, Code 2.5.1.2.2.3, Telephone (301) 342-9921, FAX (301) 757-2276 or via email: theresa.newbold@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) sole-source follow-on contract to General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (GDAIS), Fairfax, Virginia for software development and support of the System Track Manager/Track Server (STM/TS) for the Aegis and Ship Self Defense System (SSDS).  The STM is responsible for the creation and maintenance of system level tracks, including the assignment of system track numbers and maintenance of the system track state and system track attributes.  For Advanced Capability Build 12 (ACB 12), this common STM will integrate the results of air track management with track management of other track categories (e.g. ballistic missiles, surface, subsurface) to form a combat system level integrated track file.  For SSDS, the common STM will replace the current STM supporting management of all track categories (Air, Space, EW, Acoustic, Points, etc.).Track Server (TS) is a common service that can be incorporated into any component within the Navy's objective combat system architecture that needs to maintain local copies of one or more track files.  It provides access by local client applications to systems and source track data.  It maintains consistency between track file replicas, essentially creating a distributed track store.  This same service can be instantiated as a component which can accept service requests for track data from local or remote clients.  The STM/TS are the first in this series of components which will be common to both the Aegis and SSDS combat systems.  The development strategy consists of incremental upgrades to field the system track management improvements toward full capability.  The first ACB12 platform implementation of the STM/TS will be developed in four increments for the Aegis combat system.  Increment 1 through Increment 4 is the core functionality, and is identified as Spiral 1.  Spiral 2 of STM/TS, consisting of Increment 5 and Increment 6, will build on the core functionality and deliver added functionality for the CVN78 Ship Self Defense System (SSDS).
NAVSEA intends to award a CPFF contract resulting from this synopsis on a sole source basis under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  GDAIS, the successful offeror under the previously competitively awarded track manager systems integration contract, is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the Navy's requirements for STM/TS and having the capability to meet the program schedules for development and integration into the Aegis and SSDS combat systems.
Notice: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may respond to this synopsis with a letter of capability and interest, or may submit an unsolicited proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Southern Research Institute (SoRI), 2000 9th Avenue W, Birmingham, Alabama 35205-2708 for the continued support in thermal and mechanical testing and analysis of materials for use in advanced reentry applications, ground and flight test support, and life extension studies for both the US and UK to support Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) reentry systems and the Reentry Systems Applications Program (RSAP).  This is a follow-on to NSWCDD Contract N00178-08-C-3041.  SoRI's unique and highly specialized testing capabilities make them uniquely qualified to perform this effort.  SoRI has proprietary facilities, test methods and test specimens that accommodate both the unique aspects of reentry materials and the ability to test at temperatures up to 5500 degrees Fahrenheit.  Under this requirement, new test results must be compared with previous test results.  New tests of materials must be performed in a like manner, using the same unique facilities, equipment, and technical expertise as was used in the previous tests.  Due to the complexity of the tests and the need for consistency between tests, it is essential that SoRI perform the work.  A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract will be awarded.  The contract will include a one year base period and four one year options.  The solicitation number is N00178-10-R-3024.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on 30 June 2010.  Award is anticipated on 01 December 2010.  Numbered note 22 applies.  Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to Cheryl Jason at cheryl.jason@navy.mil or (540) 653-4404.

<DESC>NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Magnavolt Technologies, Inc. 334 Cornelia Street #525, Plattsburgh, NY 12901-1806 on a sole source basis for the purchase of the MagnaVolt TC.P.32.52.480.SHMI, a high current power supply for the development of a magnetic sweep power subsystem.  This program requires another power supply system to begin integration onto the aircraft.  It is extremely critical that the exact same model be purchased from the same manufacture.  Use of another power supply system for integration into the magnetic sweep power subsystem may introduce new or change existing parameters that may be harmful to the magnetic sweep power subsystem.  Also a new power supply system may invalidate all operational and safety testing to date thus requiring additional funding.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Dianna G. Saenz, Phone 210 395-8232, Email dianna.saenz@us.af.mil
<DESC>The Department of the Air Force ("the Air Force") requests an expression of interest from prospective entities (developers, contractors, teams, consortiums, joint ventures, etc.) capable of developing, designing, owning and operating a solar energy generation project at Kirtland Air Force Base (AFB), New Mexico. The Air Force seeks information regarding potential construction and operation of a solar project in terms of an operating agreement parties would require in order for parties to fully analyze and make proposals for the opportunity, as well as questions and concerns market participants might have. Please see the list of questions below. The Air Force will consider other approaches to this business opportunity and respondents are encouraged to submit alternative business models to improve the return to the Air Force. Please submit any questions or additional information you would like included in a solicitation, should this project proceed.
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Air Force is considering the merits of leasing 840 acres (map attached) of non-excess land for a 20 megawatt (MW) solar project on the installation. Both sites are relatively flat, undeveloped open fields with sparse vegetation. Each site is subject to Federal Aviation Administration height restrictions that may preclude development of solar systems that rely on tall structures. Public Service New Mexico (PNM), the local utility provider, operates one 345 kilovolt (kV) transmission line adjacent to one site and a 115kV transmission line near the second site. Preliminary discussions with PNM indicate these transmission lines have sufficient capacity to handle approximately 60 MW of additional capacity; however, this is an estimated calculation. A detailed transmission study will be required to more accurately assess transmission impacts. It is anticipated a lease would be accomplished under authority of 10 USC &sect; 2667, authorizing the Secretary of the Air Force to out-lease non-excess real property.</p>
<p>Expression of Interest Desired:</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates a public-private partnership, that in exchange for a long-term lease of federally owned land for the solar energy generation project, would receive cash or in-kind consideration equal to, or greater than, the fair market value of the asset. Kirtland AFB currently does not anticipate purchasing any power generated from the solar energy generation project discussed within. The Air Force expects all expressions of interest to be commercially funded and financially viable ventures with associated commercial risk. In all cases, the Air Force would not develop, design, own, operate, or be the licensee for the solar energy generation project.</p>
<p>Please include in your response to this Request for Information, detailed answers to the following requirements:<br />1. Scenario or scenarios that would most interest your entity under a public/private partnership, and how the scenario(s) might be envisioned to operate in terms of finance, security, size of the project, and acreage needed. <br />2. Description of the solar energy generation project envisioned including designer, provider, source, plant life-cycle, and output. <br />3. Describe, as clearly and concisely as possible, the issues, concerns, and challenges facing your entity as you see it, in bringing a solar energy project into fruition.<br />4. Identify that which you believe you need in the way of commitments, guarantees, etc., or require from the Air Force to own and operate a solar energy generation project at Kirtland AFB.</p>
<p>Handling and Processing:</p>
<p>All responses received will be considered. Under this Request for Information or under future issuances, the Air Force may terminate or continue to pursue this effort. Under 10 USC &sect; 2667, the Air Force will use competition to pursue any leases, agreements, etc., that may be issued in pursuit of the Air Force asset management and energy goals. The Air Force expects to use consultants to assist it with its review of all responses received. All responses received may be held for an extended period of time or destroyed. In no case will any responses be returned to the originator. All information desired or required to be handled as proprietary or as confidential business information should be clearly and appropriately marked. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>This requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information. The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any, consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.</p>
<p>General Due Date:</p>
<p>Responses to this Request for Information are preferred via regular USPS mail to Ms. Michelle Isenhouer with additional copies by email and should be received no later than July 2, 2010.</p>

<DESC>The Air Force needs a source to complete a study on how environmental changes impacts nitroglycerin dynamite sticks. The Air Force needs to determine the impact of temperature and humidity on this dynamite for reliability and safety with safety being the primary factor. The Air Force is specifically interested in these temperatures and humidities: Hot: 160 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit; Cold: -40 to -60 degrees Fahrenheit; low Relative Humidity (RH): 5 to 25 RH; and high RH 80 to 95 RH.<br />A statistically significant sample (defined at time of contract per recommendation of contractor) of government furnished &frac12; pound nitroglycerin dynamite sticks shall be temperature cycled at several ranges within the evaluation limits. The temperature cycled dynamite, as well as a control group of dynamite, shall be evaluated for chemical changes that may impact reliability and safety.<br />A working knowledge of explosive material and experience in the explosive field is required. A thorough safety plan will be required.<br />A general test outline shall be provided as part of the response to the source sought. The outline shall be specific enough for the Air Force to determine expected data, recommended sample size, safety concerns and precautions, and test process.<br />The sources sought response shall have an estimate cost and schedule for budgetary purposes only along with the test outline as defined above.<br />

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs: Network Integrated Service Network Twenty-two (VISN 22) is soliciting a service requirement to establish an Open Market Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to ship to our eligible Veterans Shipment Services of ordered Medical Supplies directly to Veteran patient's home. The ordered Medical supplies shall be shipped to the patient's home via Federal Express, USPS, or UPS. 

Contractor care shall cover the range of services normally provided in a similar civilian health care facility. Services provided shall be in accordance with the specifications and requirements contained herein. The BPA duration will be for three (3) years. The government may award multiple awards on a competitive basis to provide Shipment Services of ordered Medical Supplies directly to Veteran patient's home. This Request for Quotation as well as any subsequent award is subject to the applicable terms and conditions set forth under Federal Acquisition Regulations part 13. Pricing for services will not exceed the ceiling prices negotiated in the Pricing list submitted.  

MULTIPLE AWARDS: Since experience has demonstrated that one contractor cannot provide a guarantee to meet our needs, it is our intention to make multiple awards with a possible restriction on the number of awards made. As a consequence, it is reasonable to assume that we may not require the daily shipment services of all contractors awarded a BPA. In some instances, it is possible that a contractor's shipment services may not be utilized at all. With all things being equal, the VA will order medical supplies, on an as needed basis. The Government shall make a reasonable effort to rotate contractors. Performance and availability will be critical factors in obtaining orders.

The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price Open Market Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to ship ordered medical supplies directly to veteran patient's home for VISN 22. Shipments shall be made to the areas listed below, unless otherwise directed by the COTR. Contractor shall contact COTR.

The ordered medical supplies are to be shipped pursuant to orders for the following facilities the Ordering Facilities:

For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm. Authority: 41 USC 253(c)(1). The FSC for this is 5845 and the NAICS Code is 611310, small business size standard is $6.5 million. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. The Northeast Fisheries Science Center will be conducting a study of loggerhead sea turtle behavior in the Mid-Atlantic region and also into the larger Northwest Atlantic Ocean. This project is a continuation of pilot research which as initiated in 2009. The primary data-acquisition platform for this research is detailed dive information collected by Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SRDL).
<p>In the 2009 pilot research, we selected the SRDLs from the Sea Mammal Research Unit which provides impartial, independent and innovative science that has high relevance to society. It carries out interdisciplinary research into the biology of marine mammals, trains marine mammal scientists through undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and advises governments, non-governmental organizations and industry on conservation issues. SMRU's internationally renowned Instrumentation Group develops a range of marine mammal telemetry tags for use by SMRU and other researchers.</p>
<p>Given that the first part of this project successfully used SMRU tags, for the purposes of consistency, we are requesting that Sea Mammal Research Unit be awarded a sole source contract for this work.</p>
<p>No other entity can provide the necessary tags that will be compatible with existing research and tags. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is exploring sources, on behalf of the Protected Resources Division of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for a priority research project relative to Atlantic Sturgeon in the James River. <br />The primary objectives of this study are to gather data on the migration patterns and habitat utilization of Atlantic sturgeon in the James River. A temporal and spatial description of sturgeon movement and habitat occupation is needed. It is necessary for this information to be presented in Geospatial (GIS) analysis to determine life stage specific trends. Also, tracks will need to be integrated into high-resolution benthic maps to further resolve habitat use where possible. A secondary objective focuses on identifying potential spawning habitat by overlaying adult tracks in the spring and fall with the benthic maps of the James River. Another objective of this study would be to continue population monitoring. This would include the continuation of a relative abundance survey in the James so that population abundance trends can be accurately determined. Data to support the description of critical population parameters, including abundance, age, size structure, and growth will be collected including tissue samples for genetics. Mark and recapture efforts in the James will be continued and the information presented in any interim and final reports to NMFS. If additional funding is available to continue this work over the course of four option years, this will allow for a very robust population monitoring program that will provide needed data to develop a population estimate for the James River subpopulation which is critical to recovery efforts. Tasks to be completed include the following: 1) Continue to deploy the sonic array consisting of 40-45 receivers in this area and maintain it for at least one additional year. This array will stretch from the lower James River near river mile 28 (Burwell Bay) to river mile 75 (Rockets deep water terminal), and it will provide 24 hour remote tracking year round. 2) Some gill net sampling will be conducted to continue population monitoring efforts in order to gather information necessary for developing a robust population estimate for the James River subpopulation. From this sampling effort, at least five additional sturgeon will be implanted with transmitters (using VEMCO V16 transmitters or a similar type), tracked using the VEMCO array (existing and augmented by 2 new VR2W wireless passive receivers), and released. 3) Subsequent tracks from the over sixty fish that are carrying transmitters will be examined by life stage (adults&gt;1550mmTL, sub adults&lt;1150 and YOY&lt;550mm) for habitat use patterns to identify temporal and spatial migration trends and patterns in habitat occupation. This information will be displayed in GIS maps. 4) Adult tracks in the spring will be cross referenced with benthic habitat maps to determine potential spawning habitats and this information shared with other partners who are leading spawning habitat restoration efforts. 5) Habitat use patterns will be examined by life stage (adult/sub-adult) and river mile to determine guidelines for time/area regulations and improved area based abundance models. This information will be displayed in GIS maps. 6) Migration patterns will be examined for temporal and spatial trends as well as relationships with physical parameters such as temperature, moon cycle and potentially tide levels. This information will be displayed in GIS maps.</p>

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition  Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under  authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Allen Scientific Glass Inc of  Boulder, CO for the purchase of 105 specialized air sampling flasks.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for&nbsp; two-valved air  flasks with serial numbers which have been tested extensively for  stability with respect to the trace gases of interest.</p>
<p>The Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases (CCGG) group of the Global  Monitoring Division (GMD)operates a global air sampling network to  measure the distribution and variations of climatically important trace  gases (CO2, CH4, CO, H2, N2O, SF6) and stable isotopic ratios (13C/12C,  18O/16O of CO2 in the global atmosphere. GMD has recently added  measurements of the D/H rations of CH4, 14C of CO2 and 10 volatile  organic compounds (VOCs) to the data collection efforts.</p>
<p>These air samples are collected in 2.5 liter borosilicate glass  flasks sealed by means of Teflon O-ring stopcocks and serially numbered.  Because these gases are long-lived and well mixed in the atmosphere,  the spatial and temporal variations are relatively small. This requires  that the measurements are extremely accurate and precise, on the order  of 0.03% for CO2. To obtain the needed levels of accuracy and precision,  the air sample composition must not change (gain or loss of any trace  gas molecules) during storage in the flasks over time periods ranging  from weeks to 1.5 years. Any changes in the materials or methods used in  the measurements require time-consuming testing to insure that  artifacts or offsets are not introduced into the existing long time  series. Subtle artifacts could lead to erroneous interpretations of the  data. Therefore, it is important that the flask material be non-reactive  to the stored gases and that the valve stopcocks prohibit against  leakage at a wide range of altitudes and pressures.</p>
<p>Market research has shown that these flasks are not readily available  on the market and that they need to be manufactured in order to meet  specifications for durability and inertness with respect to the trace  gases being measured.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals  and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe  they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's  requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the  identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this  synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of  determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive  basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive  procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the  discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in  response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division has a requirement to provide support to the Army National Guard. The Army National Guard (ARNG) has a validated urgent requirement for training systems support for its individual and collective training initiatives.  The specific support addressed in this requirement pertains to the ARNG's deployable instrumentation capability (Flex Train) and the Mobile Virtual Training Capability (MVTC) for both live and virtual training.  The ARNG intends to employ training systems solutions incorporating new technologies and optimizing the use of non-developmental items (NDI), Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products have proven to be both highly effective and cost efficient for the decentralized and time constrained nature of training ARNG Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs).   The natures of the ARNG operational tempo, along with the limited availability of the Army's Combat Training Centers (CTCs) for ARNG BCT rotations, have necessitated the development and adoption of alternative, but equally effective, training solutions.  The ARNG has several on-going efforts that have helped successfully meet this training challenge.  Among these programs and initiatives are the: eXportable Combat training Capability (XCTC), MVTC, Deployable Force-on-Force Instrumented Range System (DFIRST), and Flex Train. The ARNG continues to seek proven and flexible training and training support systems that immerses its Soldiers into the Contemporary Operational Environment where Company level and below units can develop proficiency, practice established Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs), recorded the execution of these TTPs for evaluation and critique, and where the clock can be turned back as necessary to achieve the experience and confidence required to m! eet operational commitments. This contract addresses the specific systems and support required in areas of instrumentation and training to provide the additional capabilities required for the ARNG Flex Train and MVTC projects.  Support will include collective training and simulation equipment, testing, integration, operational demonstration, program management, asset accountability, and contractor logistics support (CLS) services.
This is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with FFP Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs).  Specific requirements will be defined in individual CLINs and sub-CLINs, which may be individually exercised at the Government's discretion:

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The University of Memphis, 115 Wilder Tower, Memphis TN  38152-0001 for the use of facilities, and adjoining support services at the University of Memphis, Center for Earthquake Research and Information, which includes:  office space and utilities, use of secretarial, drafting, computer staff, and graduate research assistant; as well, network access and usage for computer equipment, miscellaneous copying, mail , dedicated fax line  and GIS services - Tech info specialist.
This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition:
The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) requires that the US Geological Survey (USGS), Department of the Interior, emphasize earthquake hazards research and related activities in four geographic regions, one of which is the central US/New Madrid region.  The USGS NEHRP in the New Madrid region benefits from the scientific and technical investigations carried out by the University of Memphis by experts with special skills and experience in earthquake research and mitigation activities.  The presence of University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information (UM/CERI) with its longstanding active research programs in the New Madrid region, makes it necessary for the USGS to work cooperatively in order to strengthen the regional research effort to reduce earthquake hazards in this seismically active part of the United States.
It is imperative that the USGS scientists are located on-site at the University in order to perform collaborative research, conduct cooperative seismological studies, interpret seismic data records and documentation archived at the University, and attend meetings and conferences held on campus often with no prior notice.
Another location off-campus would inhibit scientific interaction with the UM scientists, reduce the effectiveness of important cooperative research activities with the University, and make more inaccessible the scientific and technical database required for USGS seismic research.
Firms that believe they can provide the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 15 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at mhutchison@usgs.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS). Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 611310, which is $6.5 million per year averaged over the last 3 years.

<DESC>Request for Information On the  Rugged Mobile Non-Intrusive Inspection System (RMNIIS)

The Marine Corps Systems Command Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Detection Systems Program Office is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to determine the availability of sources capable of providing a Rugged Mobile Non-Intrusive Inspection System (RMNIIS).  This RFI is for planning purposes only and is not a solicitation.  Responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties responding to this RFI.  Any information the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.
The MRAP Detection Systems Program Office is seeking a manufacturer who is capable of providing the production, delivery, and sustainment of RMNIIS systems.  The MRAP Detection Systems Program Office anticipates the solicitation and award of a contract to service as many as ten (10) RMNIIS systems from June 2010 to March 2011.  This effort will be pursued as a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI), firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/ indefinite quantity contract pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 2, which provides the standard definition of a COTS/NDI.
The RMNIIS will be used in military and police security operations at checkpoints and entry control points in Afghanistan to identify concealed weapons, contraband, ordnance, and bulk explosives.  The desired preference is for a towed system capable of operating on primary, secondary, and unimproved road surfaces that uses low dose radiation for detection of organic and inorganic materials, inspection of vehicle interiors, including cargo areas (empty and filled with mixed cargo) and engine compartments.  The primary movers of the RMNIIS will be MRAP Vehicle variants.
The RMNIIS effort has been initiated to produce and deploy a commercial type highly rugged mobile inspection system that will fulfill the following requirements.  The RMNIIS shall be capable of imaging with sufficient resolution for minimally trained operators to identify 22.73 kg (50 lbs) of bulk explosives or a single 155mm shell through complex cargo (preferred) or privately owned vehicle interiors.  The RMNIIS shall be capable of scanning stationary vehicles and vehicles moving up to 11.2km/h (7.0 mph) at a distance of up to 3.75 m (12.30ft), not to exceed three minutes per scan of a 40 foot shipping container containing complex cargo or personal vehicle while still occupied without harming its occupant(s).  
Tactical lighting is required.  The RMNIIS shall be capable of remote operation by wire at a minimum of 300 meters and must be fully operational within 30 minutes of location arrival.  The RMNIIS must not contain an active radiation source and shall be transportable on C-130, C-17, or C-5 aircraft with integrated tie down points that meet transportation requirements.  The RMNIIS shall have the ability for the operator to view images in gray-scale or color and have the capability to export stored images with operator comments to Microsoft Office products.  The RMNIIS shall operate on military JP8 fuel, commercial diesel fuel, electricity (110/220V 50/60Hz AC and/or 28V DC) and shall be of a size and configuration that does not draw undue attention to its intended application, and is of similar design to systems previously or currently deployed by the United States military.  It is desired the RMNIIS use a tactical trailer type already deployed by the U.S. military.  The RMNIIS must not be susceptible to electronic interference with tactical radio or radar systems and must operate reliably under austere conditions with environmental extremes of fine particulate dust and temperatures of -20 to +50 degrees Celsius.  The RMNIIS shall be able to operate under its own power (i.e. a generator).  The RMNIIS shall have minimal impact on manpower requirements of physical security or force protection operations with a preferred manpower requirement not to exceed two individuals.  
Support of the RMNIIS will be Contractor Logistics Support in worldwide locations as required, including areas where U.S. and coalition forces are engaged in military operations.  Identified personnel will be required to meet CENTCOM MOD deployment requirements.
Responses to this RFI should not exceed  10 pages and must contain at a minimum the following:?	A positive statement of interest to submit a proposal as a prime contractor on a future solicitation for this service ?	Evidence of at least three (3) recent experiences in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and percent of work performed, description of work performed, and points of contact with current telephone numbers.?	Video output and display resolution, power requirements (startup vs. steady state [continuous]) for individual subsystems and total overall system level, overall system weight(s), physical dimensions, Cool down time, Warm up time, detection capability, system reliability, shock tests, time to operate, radiation type, detector/sensor type, ability to display and distinguish between organic and inorganic matter under inspection, operating altitudes, environmental limitations, data transfer rate, data transmission capabilities (category of transmission cable or fiber optic cable).
Responses are due by 15 June 2010.  Both e-mail and mail submittals will be accepted.  Please send e-mail responses to the Contract Specialist, Frederick.Cartes@usmc.mil.  Mailed responses should be sent to: Fred Cartes, Contract Specialist, JPO-MRAP, 50 Tech Parkway Suite 203, Rm 209 Stafford, VA 22556.

An urgent need exists to increase the number of peer-reviewed publications that focus on reducing health disparities and examine the link with social determinants of health. Currently, there are few studies that have examined effective methods to address social determinants of health in our efforts to prevent and control HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis. In addition, there are a limited number of published studies examining social determinants and associated strategies that can be systematically prioritized to produce the greatest impact in accelerating the reduction of health disparities in these diseases. Moreover, studies focusing on developing and identifying key metrics which might be used to better measure and monitor the impact of social determinants on health on these diseases are not present in the literature.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1(c) (ii), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole contract to Association of Schools of Public Health to provide publication in the journal Public Health Reports

<p>On March 26, 2010, Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) posted a notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). This notice announced procedures pertaining to the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) Board of Directors (BOD) resolution for products (Federal Supply Classes or FSCs) other than those managed by the Department of Defense (DOD), where FPI market share reaches 20 percent or more. This resolution directs FPI to limit the application of mandatory source to non-DoD managed products for which FPI's share of the Federal market is less than 20 percent.</p>
<p>The notice also stated that the FSC codes which are covered under the 20 percent resolution will be reviewed on an annual basis, in conjunction with the publication of FPI's annual Market Share Report. If the market share reaches 20 percent or higher, the FSC code will be added to its list and identified in the annual market share notice announcing the availability of FPI's Market Share Report. FPI will not be a mandatory source of supply for those FSCs identified on its annual list. If the market share is below the 20 percent threshold, the FSC code will be removed from the list and noted in the announcement. The review will be performed annually and the list will be published in the FedBizOpps with the announcement of FPI's Market Share Report. The current list of product supply classes affected by the Board's 20 percent resolution can also be found on FPI's website <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.unicor.gov</span></p>
<p>FPI received no written comments from any interested party regarding the procedures within the 30 days allowed. Therefore, the FPI Board of Directors has approved procedures related to the 20 percent market share resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI's Board of Directors. Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief, Marketing, Research, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534. Attention: MRACS Branch.</p>

Issued by:The Department of Interior's NBC Acquisition Services Directorate - Herndon on behalf of the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), www.ntia.doc.gov/broadbandusa 

RFI Objective:
In accordance with FAR 15.201 - Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals and FAR 5.205(c) - Special Notices, the Government is seeking market research, sources sought, and general industry information to aid in finalizing a statement of work or objectives requirements document which will be included in an upcoming solicitation.  The projected RFQ/RFP will solicit submissions leading to an award to study and report on the short and long-term economic impact and social benefits arising from the FY09 and FY10 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-5, 123 Stat. 115, 512-13 (2009) (Recovery Act).)  BTOP grant awards.  If and when a future study analysis requirement is issued, it will be advertised in accordance with Recovery Act requirements and posted to the Federal Business Opportunities web site at FedBizOpps.gov (FBO.gov).
The Government is asking for interested qualified firms to review this notice and respond as stated under the "How to Respond" section of this document.
Purpose and Requirement Information:
The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) of the NTIA is planning to conduct an evaluation study that will qualitatively and quantitatively assess BTOP's benefits and overall impact.  
Given the purpose of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act or ARRA) to stimulate the economy in the near-term and provide long-term economic growth, NTIA is interested in conducting a thorough assessment of the benefits that BTOP grant awards are having on broadband availability and adoption, and in achieving economic and social benefits in areas served by the grantees. 
The assessment should also seek to inform the Federal Government on its consideration of the return on investment from BTOP grant funding, as well as identifying factors influencing performance and impact that can be used to inform future private and/or public sector investments.  More specifically, NTIA seeks to measure and assess the benefits of BTOP investments in the areas where they serve; it is not the purpose of this study to measure nationwide changes in broadband adoption, availability, or other macroeconomic outcomes.
Accordingly, the BTOP is soliciting input from those who undertake economic impact analyses, including stakeholders from research institutions, academia, the broadband community, and others, about the scope of evaluation studies regarding BTOP's impact on broadband availability and adoption as well as its economic and social benefits.

Background:
The Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is the President's principal adviser on telecommunications and information policy issues and in this role frequently works with other Executive Branch agencies to develop and present the Administration's positions on these issues.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided NTIA with $4.7 billion to support the deployment of broadband infrastructure, enhance and expand public computer centers, encourage sustainable adoption of broadband service, and develop and maintain a nationwide public map of broadband service capability and availability.  The Recovery Act instructed NTIA to implement the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program to promote five core purposes:a. To provide access to broadband service to consumers residing in unserved areas of the country;b. To provide improved access to broadband service to consumers residing in underserved areas of the country;c. To provide broadband education, awareness, training, access, equipment, and support to:  (i) schools, libraries, medical and healthcare providers, community colleges and other institutions of higher learning, and other community support organizations; (ii) organizations and agencies that provide outreach, access, equipment, and support services to facilitate greater use of broadband services by vulnerable populations (e.g., low-income, unemployed, aged); or (iii) job-creating strategic facilities located in state- or federally-designated economic development zones;d. To improve access to, and use of, broadband service by public safety agencies; ande. To stimulate the demand for broadband, economic growth, and job creation. 
In facilitating the expansion of broadband infrastructure and adoption of broadband services, NTIA aims to advance the objectives of the Recovery Act to spur job creation and stimulate economic growth and opportunity.  Additionally, NTIA seeks to fund projects that will provide long-term economic and social benefits, including improvements to healthcare delivery, education, innovation, and the Nation's global competitive position.   
NTIA has issued two Notices of Funds Availability (NOFAs), copies of which are available at www.ntia.doc.gov/broadbandusa, outlining the objectives, rules, and processes that will govern the award and administration of BTOP grants.  As described in these documents in greater detail, BTOP has three types of awards for broadband investment:
- Infrastructure [including Comprehensive Community Infrastructure (CCI)]:  Projects to deploy new or improved broadband Internet facilities (e.g., laying new fiber-optic cables, upgrading wireless towers) to connect households, businesses and "community anchor institutions" such as schools, libraries, hospitals, and public safety facilities. Infrastructure projects funded by BTOP include middle mile or last mile projects.  CCI projects are middle mile broadband infrastructure projects that offer new or substantially-upgraded service to community anchor institutions and can include a last mile infrastructure component. 
- Public Computer Centers (PCC):  Projects to establish new public computer facilities or upgrade existing ones that provide broadband access to the general public or to specific vulnerable populations, such as low-income individuals, the unemployed, seniors, children, minorities, and people with disabilities.
- Sustainable Broadband Adoption (SBA):  Projects to provide a focus on increasing broadband Internet usage and adoption, including projects among vulnerable populations where broadband technology traditionally has been underutilized. Many projects include digital literacy training and outreach campaigns to increase the relevance of broadband in the public's everyday lives.
As of May 2010,  NTIA has awarded 82 BTOP grants totaling $1.2 billion, with nearly half of the awards applied to Infrastructure projects (predominantly middle mile).   NTIA's priority has been to fund projects that enhance broadband connections to anchor institutions such as schools, libraries, health care facilities, and other entities.  
NTIA's Round Two of funding, launched on January 22, 2010, allocated approximately $2.6 billion for grants across PCC, SBA, and CCI project categories.  The Recovery Act requires that all BTOP grants be obligated by September 30, 2010 and that BTOP projects be substantially complete within two years of the award date.  The Program's rules require projects to be fully complete within three years of the award date.  
Data about the grantees' performance will be made available through quarterly and annual Progress Reports that will be published via www.ntia.doc.gov/broadbandusa.  These reports will include, among other things, detailed progress in achieving broadband infrastructure deployment milestones, connections to community anchor institutions, homes, and businesses, public computer workstations made available to the public, and the number of broadband subscribers generated by BTOP's sustainable broadband adoption projects.  In addition, grantees will report information about their use of funds and jobs created, among other requirements, via www.recovery.gov.  These data and performance measures will be among the inputs useful in conducting the assessment.

Request for Information and Market Research:
I.  Program Information:
1.  Briefly describe the types of research study designs and economic impact analytic approaches that would be useful for evaluating the BTOP program's effectiveness.
2.  As described previously, NTIA must award all BTOP grants by September 30, 2010.  Projects must be substantially complete within two years of the award date and fully complete within three years of the award.  Considering these timeframes, briefly describe evaluation approaches that will help to measure the near-term as well as the long-term benefits of BTOP investments.  Based on your firm's experience, what approach, method, and program areas would be beneficial to study for program evaluation?  What types of benefits are reasonable to expect in the near-term (1-2 years from the award date), and what benefits should be expected long-term (2-5 years from award date or beyond)?
3.  NTIA expects to award more than 200 grants by September 30, 2010.  Given that number, would you propose to evaluate every grant or a sample of total grants?  If the latter (other than evaluating 100% of the recipients), describe a sampling methodology and approach to yield a representative sample of awards to be used for an assessment which takes into account geographic location, type of award, and other relevant factors.  Explain how the assessment should incorporate case studies of BTOP projects and the areas they benefit and or impact.  
4.  List potential approaches you would recommend to incorporating both quantitative as well as qualitative approaches to measuring BTOP benefit and or impact in the study.
5.  Given NTIA's priority of awarding infrastructure grants that enhance broadband capabilities for anchor institutions such as schools, hospitals, libraries and other entities, please indicate approaches that would measure both the economic impacts of BTOP projects as well as the social benefits of BTOP projects, such as on healthcare, education, innovation, and public safety, as well as other appropriate objectives that have been identified in the Recovery Act.  Describe an approach to gathering relevant data from anchor institutions benefitting from BTOP investments.
6.  Identify your recommended methods of measuring the benefit and or impact in communities that have received BTOP investments against baseline communities that did not receive BTOP funds.
7.  Describe the skills, qualifications, and experiences that NTIA should consider in evaluating proposals for undertaking such a study. 

The following items (8-11) will not count against the 10 page limitation for your firm's response to this RFI: 
8.  List what data collection instruments exist to measure relevant factors at various levels. If possible, please cite specific instruments and their sources. Also identify any possibly new data collection instruments that might help inform such an assessment.

<p>Project Title: Certification for ORA's newly hired Quality System Managers (QSMs) prepare for their American Society Quality (ASQ)/Certified Manager of Quality/Organizational Excellence (CMQ/OE) exam Materials.</p>
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) Quality Management System <br />The FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs is the lead office for all FDA Field activities as well as providing FDA leadership on imports, inspections, and enforcement policy. ORA supports the five FDA Product Centers by inspecting regulated products and manufacturers, conducting sample analysis on regulated products, and reviewing imported products offered for entry into the United States. ORA also develops FDA-wide policy on compliance and enforcement and executes FDA's Import Strategy and Food Protection Plans. <br />The scope and complexity of ORA's mission is getting increasingly broader. Some examples are: the food outbreaks from the past few years; new food legislation on the horizon that will greatly expand our workload and the way the organization does its' work; innovations and new complexities in drugs, biologics, devices and veterinary medicines; exponential growth in imports; as well as a large increase in our staffing leading to additional administrative burdens. <br />These examples are all proof that ORA needs to be as aligned, efficient, and effective as possible. In order to accomplish these objectives ORA's Senior Management Team (SMT) determined that a systematic implementation of a Quality Management System (QMS) would equip ORA with the tools to be better able to tackle the challenges of today and beyond. ORA has already begun to implement the QMS. This effort, stemming from the vitalization initiative was designed through a highly collaborative process involving a cross-section of employees from all areas of ORA, as well as the Centers.</p>

There is also a stand-alone course on economics for non-economic officers.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-41.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested quoters may submit a quote.</p>
<p><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Atomic Physics Division, requires a wavelength-calibrated tunable laser with operation in the telecom C-band for use in two distinct projects. For one project, the laser will be used to study photonic crystals and to couple to Fabry-Perot cavities containing photonic crystal mirrors. For the other project, the laser will be used to beat with light from a CW laser that is locked to a frequency comb. The calibration will allow NIST to infer the order number of the comb line to which the CW laser is locked.</p>
<p>All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each, calibrated tunable telecom laser that shall meet or exceed the following required specifications. All equipment must be new; used and/or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.</p>

<DESC><p>ALL INTERESTED OFFERORS ARE TO CONTACT MATT DESANTIS AT <a href="mailto:DESANTISMA@MAIL.NIH.GOV">DESANTISMA@MAIL.NIH.GOV</a> AND REQUEST THE APPROPRIATE RFP TYPE FOR THEIR ORGANIZATION:&nbsp; TIME &amp; MATERIALS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OR</span> COST REIMBURSEMENT.<br /><br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, has established the NCI Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer (http://nano.cancer.gov) to harness the power of nanotechnology to reduce the burden of cancer. Several, recent developments have demonstrated that improved approaches to therapy can be realized using nanotechnology. The development of new therapies based on localized nanoparticle delivery is of particular interest to oncology due to the potential for delivery of lower doses of the drug or drug candidates with equal or improved efficacy and lowered side effects.</p>
<p>There is a pressing need to enable the testing of nanoscale devices, delivery systems and drug payloads using appropriate animal models for preclinical safety and efficacy testing in GLP certified contract research organizations (CROs), academic institutions or pharmaceutical facilities.</p>
<p>Prior to initial entry of a new drug or biologic agent into humans, the basis for the determination of in vivo safety is the preclinical testing performed in animals. Traditional drug development programs evaluating the safety of small molecule or protein therapeutics, typically conduct toxicology testing in normal animals using a well-defined paradigm to establish the acute, subchronic, and cumulative toxicities of an agent prior to its first exposure in large animals and eventually in humans. The advantages of this approach include: <br />&bull; testing a wide range of doses<br />&bull; investigating multiples of the expected human exposure;<br />&bull; Evaluating the mechanism of action and efficiency of binding of the device/therapeutic payload with the desired target<br />&bull; understanding the metabolism and disposition profiles in a different species<br />&bull; establish a basis for comparison for clinical dosing and the background incidence of any specific, adverse finding<br />&bull; provide well-documented efficacy data in the particular strain of animals being tested (deployed as the first of two animal species that need to be used for the initial demonstration of safety)</p>
<p>Note: for the purposes of filing IND (Investigational New Drug) application with FDA, typically testing in both rodents (i.e. mice, rats, or hamsters), and one non-rodent species (e.g. dog, pig, or non-human primate) is required. The use of more than one species in traditional drug evaluation programs is generally encouraged, to increase the chance of detecting any toxicity to be monitored during Phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials.</p>
<p>The purpose of this subcontract is to identify and evaluate the clinical potential of candidate targeted nanotherapeutics which has shown promise in small animal models for subsequent efficacy and toxicity testing in large animal models. It is expected that data gathered under this subcontract will enable filing of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications with the US-FDA.</p>

Cleaning the Structural Surfaces of the Coach House Carriage Wing at the Vanderbilt Mansion        1 Job              Lump Sum $___________

Specifications: Project Description
The National Park Service (NPS) is seeking proposals for cleaning the structural surfaces of the Coach House Carriage Wing at the Vanderbilt Mansion NHS in Hyde Park, New York.  Conservators, particularly those specializing in wood with experience in preventive conservation of historic structures, are encouraged to design a protocol and direct a team to undertake this work.
The 1897 room historically stored horse-drawn vehicles and was converted in 1910 to include motor vehicles.  Today, the room provides storage of the park's collection of historic horse-drawn and motor vehicle associated with the Vanderbilt and Roosevelt properties in Hyde Park, and is opened intermittently for visitor programs.  The project is intended to address conditions including built-up dust and dirt, mold, and waste left by pests including rodents, insects, spiders, and birds, without damaging the historic building structural components and finishes.   The historic vehicles will be surface cleaned by the park museum staff concurrently with the cleaning of the room.  The vehicles may only be moved by or under the direction of members of the park curatorial division, necessitating a coordinated effort by the Contractor and park staff.  

Historic BackgroundThe Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site is one of three congressionally-designated sites managed jointly by the National Park Service (NPS) in Hyde Park, New York.  The site comprises portions of the former country estate of Frederick and Louise Vanderbilt, known historically as Hyde Park.  The Vanderbilt house was built on a ridge overlooking the Hudson River in 1895-98 by McKim, Mead and White. The Coach House was designed by Robert H. Robertson and built in 1897.  The building was renovated in 1910 to accommodate motor vehicles.   The site was designated a National Historic Site in 1940 under the direction of President--and native Hyde Park resident-- Franklin D. Roosevelt, and is currently managed jointly by the NPS with FDR's home and that of Eleanor Roosevelt.
Carriage WingThe carriage wing consists of one room measuring 43.5' X 67.5' with a Gothic style exposed hammer truss framing system supporting a 2-story high ceiling  Each decorative timber is chamfered and the ends of the cut joists ornamented with carved lion's heads.  The walls and ceiling are paneled in beaded boards, largely finished in amber shellac with painted elements and trims.  The room contains 18 windows, a wide sliding doorway on the south wall, and double doors to the outside on the west side.  Eight large pendant light fixtures with glass shades hang from the sloped ceiling and the joists.  Two Modine heaters dating from 1930s-40s hang in ceiling corners but are not operational.  The floor is primarily a clear-finished herringbone patterned oak, with an interior driveway of scored poured concrete dating to the 1910 renovations. The wood floor was refinished in 1940.  Above the carriage wing is a small unfinished attic space containing six louvered vents, and dormers.  The room currently contains a collection of Roosevelt and Vanderbilt carriages and sleighs and 3 automobiles.  The park staff will clean this collection before and during the cleaning of the Carriage Wing.  

Scope of WorkUPON AWARD OF CONTRACT, perform the following services:  
Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall: 
"	Prepare a work plan for NPS approval describing the condition of all structural surfaces and finishes, and recommended procedures and materials proposed to clean the Carriage Wing.  Include procedures for cleaning the attic space and viable means for excluding birds and other animals from the space. "	Provide all labor, equipment, and materials needed to surface clean the structural surfaces of the carriage room at the Vanderbilt Coach House, and remove waste/remains of birds and rodents in the vented attic above.  At a minimum, the project shall address HEPA vacuuming, wet cleaning, and thorough air drying of the Carriage Wing floor, dry cleaning of the walls and doors, cleaning the windows, and removal of all animal droppings and remains from the attic.  Install means for excluding birds and other animals from the attic space above the Carriage Wing (with access from inside only)."	Prepare a Safety Plan addressing project safety for NPS approval.  The document will enumerate all anticipated safety issues, and indicate how each will be mitigated on site.  The plan shall indicate hazards expected to be present in the Coach House, such as mold and animal droppings, any potentially hazardous materials expected to be used in the course of cleaning, including flammable, corrosive, or poisonous materials, appropriate personal protective equipment required under expected conditions.  The plan shall also address hazards associated with lifts, ladders or other machinery or equipment expected to be employed."	Coordinate the cleaning work with cleaning of the vehicles stored in the room by NPS staff, ensuring thorough ventilation for air-drying of structural surfaces and security of the vehicle collection;"	Prepare a completion report that summarizes the work completed, observations on the condition of structural elements following treatment, and follow up cyclic maintenance recommended for the structural surfaces addressed by the project.  Include digital photos documenting conditions before and after the project and the work in progress.
The Contractor shall schedule with the NPS for a period of on-site access to conduct the cleaning project, giving the NPS at least 2 weeks notice.  All on-site work shall be scheduled on weekdays between 9:00 and 4:30, not to include government holidays.  
The Contractor shall provide work lights for the project that are sufficient for the safety of the crew and the performance of detailed work.  The Contractor will work with the NPS to ensure that adequate and safe electrical power is available.  Power will be provided by the NPS.
Only HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) vacuums are to be used in the course of the project to maximize cleaning effectiveness and minimize the hazards of airborne dust for the team and park staff.  These vacuums will arrest 99.97% of all particles 0.3 microns or larger.  This is critical given the known hazards associated with dried rodent droppings and urine, mold, and other potential hazards that may be present.  Only vacuums such as the Pullman-Holt Economy Vacuum or its equivalent shall be used to protect the workers from airborne particulates and maximize the cleaning effort.  
Notify park staff when substantial amounts of airborne dust may occur, so that precautions can be taken to minimize triggering of false fire alarms.
Restroom facilities in the Coach House may be used by the contractor and his team.
All telephone calls must be made by cellular phones belonging to the Contractor or his team.  No phones inside the Coach House may be used by the crew or sub-contractors.
Food and beverages are to be stored and consumed in the Coach House lunch room or outside the structure
Safety and Accident Prevention Plan
Smoking within any park building is prohibited.  .Provide all team members and sub-contractors with an initial safety meeting conducted by the team leader.  Train each team member or sub-contractor exposed to hazardous materials in safe and approved methods of handling, storage, and disposal, and in the proper use of all equipment, ladders, or lifts.  Provide additional meetings if and when new procedures are introduced to the project.

FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items does not apply to this solicitation.  The evaluation procedures at FAR 15.101-2 (Lowest Price Technically Acceptable) will be used.  Under this procedure trade-offs are not permitted and proposals are evaluated for technical acceptability (pass/fail), but not ranked using the non-price factors.  
Accordingly, all offers will be evaluated as follows.  In order to be considered, proposals must address all technical acceptability requirements listed below.

Requirements for Technical Acceptability.

First, offers will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis to ensure that they meet the following technical acceptability factors.  

Prior Experience with Abstracting, Title Search, Title examination and Title Opinion, Easement Closings, Title commitments and Final Title Insurance Policies.  :
Offers must demonstrate that their firm has significant prior experience with easement closings in the geographic area(s) specified.  This includes both the quantity and frequency of conducting the tasks described in the Statement of Work.  In order to meet the minimum requirement, offers must have completed at least five (5) easement projects in the last twelve (12) months, for each of the last two (years).  This will be evidenced by providing details in their proposal on the type of entity the closing was conducted for (federal, state, local government, private business, or a private landowner, etc), the location of the property by county, the nature of the transaction, the types of activities performed (i.e. abstracting, title search, title opinion/commitment, providing title insurance, and closing), and the date for all conducted in the last two (2) years to meet this requirements for this element.  Experience with federal agencies is desired. 

Personnel Qualifications:
All personnel working on any NRCS projects under any resultant contracts must have a minimum of five (5) years experience having performed the aforementioned types of services at least 50% of their normal working hours.  Offers must identify all personnel who will work on any NRCS projects under any resultant contract.  For each person the following details must be provided (title, years of experience, percentage of time spent on pertinent duties, education and any applicable certifications/licenses).  Those offers whose personnel meet the minimum years of experience and percentage of time requirements will meet the acceptability requirements for this element. 

Resource Plan/Performance Capability:
The amount of work estimated to be performed over the duration of contract period will vary from potentially no active easement projects to several active at one time.  Many times the nature of these projects is seasonal and several awards will be made in a relatively short period of time.  During these periods of high volume additional resource must be applied by the vendor to ensure that the timelines for deliverables in the Statement of Work are met.  Additionally, there are limitations on the number of total active projects that the government is required to give to a vendor for a given geographic area (see 52.216-19, Order Limitations clause).   As such offerors must adequately demonstrate that they have the capability to meet potential demand.  For example, this can be demonstrated through providing detail on how additional human resources internal to the vendor can be applied to the projects as needed and/or by articulating what resources can be outsourced to other qualified firms.  The plan must give the NRCS confidence that needed resource is available to ensure timely completion of all projects to meet the acceptability requirements for this element.


Past Performance:
Past performance information is one indicator of an offerors ability to perform the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in performance will be considered.  Offerors must provide five (5) past performance references that are recent (within the last 2 years) and relevant to the type or services to be provided under any resultant contract.  Offerors who have encountered problems on any of the projects for the identified references should state what the problem was and the corrective action(s) taken by the offeror.  This information, combined with any information learned from the references will be used as a basis for determining whether the offeror meets acceptability requirements for this element.  Offerors without any past performance information will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, this does not except offerors from meeting the prior experience factor listed previously.


Price Evaluation
Secondly, offers that pass all technical requirements will be ranked by price for each geographic area they are submitting an offer on.  A separate price schedule must be provided for each geographic area.  Price will be evaluated by summing the value of all seven (7) line items for each period (Base, Option 1, and Option 2), with the lowest value representing the lowest priced offer (see provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options).

Award for each of the up to eight (8) geographic areas will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting the acceptability factors listed previously for non-price factors.  If a vendor ranks number one on price for more than one area, the area(s) up to two (2) areas that represent the lowest price will be awarded to that vendor.  If the price is the same for all areas, the area in order of preference submitted by the vendor will be followed.  I absence of this preference the area where the offerors primary project office resides will be selected.  For the other areas, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror will receive award, provide the price offered is fair and reasonable.  If only one offer is received from an area, a contract will only be awarded to that offeror if the price is determined to be fair and reasonable. 


(x) Offerors are not required to complete a copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and CertificationsCommercial Items, with its offer.  However, to be considered all offerors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) and have completed the online representations and certifications.  For information regarding registration in ORCA, contact the ORCA web site at https://orca.bpn.gov.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No.DTRT57-10-Q-80066 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13.5 and Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated clauses/provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39 dated March 19, 2010. The NAICS Code is 541519 and the Small Business size standard is $25 M. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Contract on a competitive basis to provide commercial aircraft analysis tool and database software. For award rational see Evaluation Criteria below. Proposals shall include technical information and pricing for the following items in a written proposal. Note: Offerors are required to provide a price for all CLINS. CLIN 0001 Commercial Aircraft Analysis Tool and database per Statement of Work 1 EA $______; CLIN 0002 one year data license for up to 10 users for Commercial Aircraft Tool per Statement of Work 1 EA $______; CLIN 0003 One year software updates for Commercial Aircraft analysis Tool per Statement of Work 1 EA $______; CLIN 0004 One year technical support for Commercial aircraft Analysis Tool per Statement of Work 1 EA $______; CLIN0001-0004 Total for all CLINS in the requirement $________ .<br /><br />This Statement of Work (SOW) is as follows: BACKGROUND: Existing analytical tools are inadequate to assess interdependences between aviation-related noise and emissions including the cost/benefit analyses of proposed actions. Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Environment and Energy (FAA/AEE) is developing a robust, new, comprehensive framework of aviation environmental analysis tools and methodologies to perform these functions. This framework will be called the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT). The long-term aim of this new computer model is to provide a seamless, comprehensive set of tools to address all aspects of aircraft noise and emissions. FAA/AEE is undertaking the development of AEDT and the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) will support this effort by leading the technical development of AEDT. A large part of this Volpe Center role will be the harmonization and integration of various types of commercial aircraft data, including aircraft engineering specifications, flight schedules, geographic information, and maintenance cost information. This type of commercial aircraft analysis will require an advanced aircraft performance analysis software tool that allows the user to access the information described below for existing turbo-prop and jet aircraft as well as theoretical aircraft that can be developed in the software.<br /><br />SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS: The software to be purchased will be used in preliminary design, existing aircraft evaluation, performance studies and other developmental tasks. The software must have a reasonably clean user interface that allows users to load existing aircraft from its database or define completely new ones from scratch. The aircraft will be evaluated, modified, and saved to a desktop or laptop computer equipped with the Microsoft Windows Operating System. The software must produce detailed reports and plots of the aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics, departure, en-route, and approach performance, plus additional specifications described below. Text and pictures must be saved to standard formats, including Excel and PDF. The software must allow users to alter the aircraft design systematically to create parametric studies and tables, run iterations to match mission targets, or conduct multi-variable numerical optimizations that satisfy a variety of performance goals and constraints. <br />Detailed specifications for the commercial aircraft analysis software to be purchase are described below:<br /><br />1. Commercial Aircraft Design Input Parameters (see Attachment A for listing of required input parameters)
<p>&nbsp;2. Geometry and Balance Data (see Attachment B for specifications)</p>
<p>3. Mass Estimation Capability (see Attachment C for specifications)</p>
<p>4. Aerodynamic Characteristics Data (see Attachment D for specifications)</p>
<p>5. Aircraft Engine Modeling Capability (e.g.: dimensions of engine, fuel consumption)</p>
<p>6. Range and Mission Design and Performance Capability (see Attachment E for specifications)</p>
<p>7. Takeoff and Landing Field Length Design Capability (see Attachment F for specifications and example)</p>
<p>8. Parametric Studies and Numerical Optimization Capability</p>
<p>9. Flight Maneuver and Sequence Design Capability</p>
<p>10. Environmental Emissions (e.g.: noise, engine exhaust) and Cost Estimation, including Direct Operating Cost for dynamic scenarios</p>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), located on the National Naval Medical Campus (NNMC) in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Millipore for the following service &amp; maintenance agreement contract:
<p>&bull;  One (1) year of service and maintenance, with three (3) one- (1) year options, for one (1) GUAVA EasyCyte MINI Cell Counter, SN: 2800070189.</p>
<p>Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p>FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The GUAVA EasyCyte MINI Cell Counter is highly specialized in design and application requiring software and firmware updates and system components upgrades that are proprietary to the vendor. All major component parts and assemblies including circuit electronics are specialized in design whereby obtaining these parts from alternate sources as generic parts is not possible and not in the best interest of the Government. Millipore Corporation is the manufacturer of this system. The vendor is the only company that has specialized and technical knowledge as well as the necessary tools, manpower and repair parts to maintain this piece of equipment in an operable state. Attempting to award this contract to another company could result in lost time in research and productivity. Another vendor was not located that had the technical and specialized knowledge and/or accessibility to repair parts for this system.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p><br />COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with U.S. Government priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects. In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States Government's top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with U.S. Government (USG) priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects. In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><br />Category 6 UTP Drop Installation Statement of Work</p>
<p>Services: <br />&bull; Contractor needs to provide a minimum of 10year warranty on all parts that are being installed. The contractor shall have a service location site within a 50 mile radius of NMCP to be able to respond on-site within 2 hours of an initial service call if warranty work is required. Contractor will provide all labor and materials to install, test, and terminate the required amount of (according to the 4270 purchasing document) plenum rated twisted 4 pair, UTP, 100 Ohm, 24 AWG, 500 MHz (minimum) category 6 communication drops to be used for data communication. All cables will be run in the existing cable trays except as specifically exempted in writing by the NMCP COTR before installation. Contractor will make use of the interstitial, existing junction boxes (must properly drilled and sleeved so box can be closed and secured after installation), conduits and adding to the current data jacks if possible. The cable backbone will be secured to the building structure every ten feet with proper fasteners if there are no existing cable trays or conduit. No cable run will be longer than 90 meters or 295 feet to allow placement of patch cables and still meet the maximum CAT6 limit of 95 meters or 327 feet. This includes an 18 inch concealed courtesy loop at the user end and 10 foot service loop at the closet end. Cables shall not bend beyond the radius specified by the manufacturer and should not bend beyond the Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard (TIA/EIA-568-B.1 Chap 10.2.1, and TIA/EIA B.1-1 Addendum 1). All cable, when penetrating a firewall, will be sleeved and sealed with fire stopping and will not exceed the 80% fill rate in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC). UTP cable jacketing will be stripped IAW ANSI/EIA/TIA 568B standards. In addition, the cabling will be run IAW ANSI/EIA/TIA standards to ensure cabling is not run over top of lighting or violating any other set standards. Drops will be installed as home runs from the user wall plate to the communication closet. All drops will be terminated at the user end with RJ-45 angled modular jacks (Panduit, Leviton or Ortronics when required). The outlets will be in flush or surface mounted boxes with single, dual, triple or quad face plates. Surface mounted boxes will only be used when flush mounted jacks are not feasible (this will need to be approved by Networking and Facilities at NMCP). Drops are to be installed only where existing electrical outlets exist within 6 feet, but not less than 3 feet, do not cross doorways, and will not cohabitate with electrical runs in modular furniture or conduits leading from the overhead. Data cables will be punched down on a government provided category 6 patch panel if present or a contractor provided patch panel (a modular Panduit or Leviton) if required in the 4270. All category 6 cables will be 100% tested to EIA/TIA standards upon completion of installation. Drops will be labeled in accordance with site labeling standards. All labeling will be machine produced; no handwritten labels are permitted to remain on the cabling. The standard used at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth is communications closet name and drop number. For example 2A01-005, would be a properly labeled drop. All drops will have the room, outlet, and drop number on both ends of each cable. The same labeling will be found on the wall plate as well as the patch panel in the communication closet. When testing the cabling, the drops and the patch panel in the communications closet will be checked for correct labeling and accuracy. Once drops have been completed in any area with both installation and testing, contractor needs to contact the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389) to have the completed work inspected for accuracy and completion. At least 10% of the drop testing will be observed by a representative from the Network Team. During move, relocation or construction projects all cabling that is disconnected SHOULD NOT be left in the ceiling. Vendor must completely remove the cable from the wall jack to the patch panel and carefully document the drop number that was removed. The removed cabling list will be provided to the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389). If cabling was removed through a firewall, all fire stopping must be replaced or filled-in in accordance National Electric Code (NEC).</p>
<p>Deliverables: <br />Contractor will provide site with complete test documentation as well as a cable running list (Appendix A). The cable running list will include building number, floor number, room number, drop number and drop location. Drop location is explained in Appendix B. If cable removal is applicable, vendor must provide a list of all data drop numbers removed to include room number it was removed from. (Appendix A). Contractor will also provide 2 CAT6 patch cables for each data drop installed. The cable at the patch panel will be 5ft in length and the other will be 15ft in length (the patch cables will be delivered to the Networking Office Bldg. 249 room 127).</p>
<p>**DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK, ALL INTERESTED VENDORS MUST ATTEND A "WALK THROUGH" TO EXAMINE WORK CONDITIONS AND EXISTING EQUIPMENT. BIDS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FROM CONTRACTORS THAT DO NOT ATTEND THE WALK THROUGH.**</p>

Depending on the incident or threat, all personnel to include contractors may be denied access to the installation for safety/security reasons.<br />(I) Contractors are subject to spot checks or inspections of their vehicles and personal items at entry control points or facility access points during higher threats or during random antiterrorism measure checks. Failure to comply with these added security measures may result in denial of access to the installation.<br />(II) Contractors are encouraged to receive Antiterrorism Awareness Training annually available at no cost, but it is not required in CONUS. Installation, Mission Element or the Unit Antiterrorism Representative (ATR) can provide this training when requested. Contractors can play an important role in protecting the installation and are encouraged to report suspicious activity to Security Forces by either calling 911 during emergencies or 333-2000.<br />(ii) Operations Security (OPSEC): As applicable based on the scope and nature of the contract, the contractor shall comply with Government OPSEC guidance and training as prescribed in AFI 10-701, Operations Security, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1 and AFI 33-332, Privacy Act, for handling of For Official Use Only (FOUO) information and HQ 10 ABW/CC Memorandum, USAFA Operations Security (OPSEC) Policy.

If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract. In addition, any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years shall also constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to restrict or immediately remove employees from effort under this contract. <br />(I) Applicable convictions include: Murder; Assault with intent to commit murder; Espionage; Sedition (Conspiracy); Kidnapping or hostage taking; Treason; Rape or aggravated sexual abuse; Unlawful possession, use, sale, distribution, or manufacture of an explosive or weapon; Extortion; Distribution or intent to distribute a controlled substance; Illegal possession of a controlled substance; and Any felony conviction involving: Armed or unarmed robbery, Arson, Acts involving a threat, Willful destruction of property, Importation or manufacture of a controlled substance, Burglary or theft, Dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, Possession or distribution of stolen property, Aggravated assault, Bribery, Violence at international airports (18 USC 37), or Conspiracy or attempt to commit any of the criminal acts listed above or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws. <br />(II) Actions that involve restrictions or removal do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(iii) Warrants. If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract. The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract. All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for renewal support for NetApp Hardware at CA/CST, SA-15.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with the Network Appliance equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Network Appliance hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product<BR><BR>

<DESC>MODIFICATION:  TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES/TASKS TO BE PERFORMED BY THE CONTRACTOR/VENDOR  AND TO ADD THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT:

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: BASE PLUS TWO AND 1/4 YEAR OPTION AGREEMENT TO BEGIN ON 7/1/2010. 

NOTE: RESPONSE DUE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED FROM MAY 25, 2010 BY 3PM EST. TO MAY 28, 2010 BY 3PM EASTERN STANDARD TIME.

THERE ARE NO OTHER CHANGES TO THIS SOLICITATION


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NICHD-10-111 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the business size standards are $7.0M.  However, this solicitation is a not a set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to procure the Professional Services of AlgoTek, Inc to continue to provide technical and scientific advice to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) in order to promote and advance the Mechanisms of Behavior Change Initiative (MOBCI).  The Institute intends to purchase this service by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.  

The MOBCI Broad area Announcement is aimed at promoting high-risk, high-yield, scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding, rather than focusing on a specific system of solution. Algotek, Inc was first retained as a special expert consultant to the NIAAA in the 2007 at the beginning to provide advice on the development of a revolutionary research initiative on the mechanisms of behavior change in alcohol use disorders. Algotek has the unique capabilities needed for this project as demonstrated by education, training, work experience, success in managing highly competitive, revolutionary research programs w/in the Federal Government.  Algotek have unique familiarity with the current project because of their recent experiences in providing consultation on its formulation and development.  Algotek expertise and credibility in mathematics, neurophysiology and computation science, as well as their demonstrated ability to establish highly effective revolutionary research programs, are essential to the NIAAA in establishing this research program.  Algotek has developed new approaches for evaluating the appropriateness and feasibility of novel computational methods and for comparing and integrating the results of heterogeneous research programs. Algotek has the professional standing and experience to attract and integrate world-class researchers normally outside the field of alcohol research, but with potentially valuable insights into the field, to collaborate with alcohol researchers.  Furthermore, Algotek has excellent relations with a number of Federal agencies that will maximize co-funding opportunities for the NIAAA. 

In continuing with our work since 2007 for FY10 Algotek, Inc will be involved in the following activities/tasks: 

	Continue to consult on technical questions and agenda preparation for proposal site visits
	Continue to participate in proposal site visits
	Consulting and participating in MOBCI kick-off meeting
	Consulting and participating in MOBCI quarterly meeting and other meetings, as needed
	Consulting on formulation of contractor milestones and deliverable and
	Facilitating of transdisciplinary collaborations within and among contractor team
	Develop a plan and format for modeling workshop
	Establish/discuss the overarching technical goals of project and how they will fit into the big picture of understanding MOBCI
	Continue to work with Consortium members on milestones and go/no-g decisions for projects during Year one
	Identify notable progress areas and technical achievements
	Discussion and formulation of desirable model/data/result sharing and use among  Consortium members
	Formulation/development  of initial Wiki site for sharing of data, articles, models and general communication and team building
	Discussion and Assist with Next Steps: Configuration management and SharePoint development
	Travel to Consortium Teams and NIAAA as needed
	Support MOBCI Consortium goal/milestone development and technical assessment
	Support MOBCI technical workshops, Principal Investigator meetings and site visits to Consortium sites
	Facilitate and support inter- and intra-project inter-disciplinary collaborations
	Provide input to NIAAA information systems staff on MOBCI Consortium wiki/collaborative environment for discussions, data sharing, references/papers sharing and possible executable models/algorithm and
	Develop model integration strategies and tool support

The U.S. Department of State (DoS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) has as one of its responsibilities the provision of a wide array of support to criminal justice sector development programs worldwide.  Program countries/areas include Afghanistan, Haiti, Iraq, Kosovo, Lebanon, Liberia, Sudan, and the West Bank.  
The Government is conducting two separate and distinct source selections under this solicitation.  Consequently, the procurement schedule and award decisions on one track will not affect the other track.  The two award tracks are: (1) Full Scope, and (2) Small Business Set-Aside.  These multiple-award IDIQ contracts (herein referred to as contracts) succeed the CIVPOL multiple-award contract.  The contracts titles are Criminal Justice Program Support (CJPS) Full Scope and CJPS Set Aside.  The Contractor will be required to provide, among other items, advisors, other specialists, and life and mission support services.

The Department of State intends to award 3 or more IDIQ CJPS Full Scope and 3 or more CJPS Set Aside training contracts by conducting an unrestricted and a partial set-aside, full and open competition in accordance with FAR Part 15.  We anticipate a one year contract with four option years. 
All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and/or a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.

Telephone request for the solicitation will not be accepted.

QUESTIONS:  
Prospective offeror(s) should submit any questions regarding this solicitation in writing by e-mail Contract Specialist, Jamie Goewey. Questions should be received by 2PM EST April 26, 2010 to ensure a timely response. Questions received after that date will not be answered prior to the date established for the receipt of proposals. Absolutely no phone calls will be accepted.
E-mail Questions to:  GoeweyJA@state.gov 

SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS:
 Offerors shall submit hand-carried proposals to be received by 2 PM EST, June 8, 2010. 

Offerors shall specify whether the proposal is a Full Scope proposal or Set Aside proposal.  

All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.

<SUBJECT>National Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Concept Call and Submission for Concepts 
<SOLNBR>10-24
<RESPDATE>060310
<CONTACT>Joseph Seto, Captain, Phone 310-416-1698, Email joseph.seto@losangeles.af.mil - Barbara Golf, Ms., Phone 310-535-2692, Email barbara.golf.ctr@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>OVERVIEW:
<p>The National Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Community (represented by SSA agencies from the Department of Defense (DoD), the Intelligence Community, the Civil Community, other Departments, and the National Labs) is announcing its intent to solicit state-of-the art SSA concepts from industry, academia, federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), and government agencies under this Special Notice.</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE CALL FOR CONCEPT DATA ONLY. DO NOT SEND A PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>This Special Notice is made up of two sections: 1) General SSA Requirements and 2) Specific National SSA Architecture Gaps.</p>
<p>Section 1: General SSA Requirements: Headquarters Air Force Space Command (HQ/AFSPC), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Electronics Systems Center (ESC), National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), and United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) are seeking both space-based and terrestrial-based concepts, to include materiel and non-materiel concepts that will enable and enhance the nation's future SSA capabilities, feasible for the 2010 through 2030 timeframe, in the area of performance, reliability and affordability. Areas of interest include but are not limited to concepts that enhance the performance of the nation's SSA capability or significantly reduce cost, schedule, or risk of existing DoD SSA capabilities (e.g. United States Strategic Command's Space Surveillance Network (SSN), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space debris cataloging capabilities, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) space environmental monitoring capabilities, Intelligence Community collection, processing, exploitation and production capabilities that support SSA).</p>
<p>Section 2: Specific National SSA Architecture Gaps: The National SSA Community is seeking both space-based and terrestrial-based concepts, to include materiel and non-materiel concepts that would mitigate specific gaps in the National SSA Architecture. These gaps are classified and will be presented at the SECRET//NOFORN// level from 0800 - 1100 and TOP SECRET//SI/TK/NOFORN// level from 1230 - 1600 on April 21, 2010 in El Segundo, California. It is recommended that Offerors with TOP SECRET//SI/TK/NOFORN// clearances attend both sessions.</p>
<p>For further instruction, please refer to the "Concept Call Instructions" section of this document.</p>
<p>Note: The National SSA gaps will be outlined in the National SSA Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) (co-led by AFSPC and the National Security Space Office (NSSO)) which will be complete in June 2010. The National SSA ICD and Architecture are being developed in response to National Security Presidential Directive-49 (NSPD-49). This directive broadens the Secretary of Defense's responsibilities beyond DoD to include SSA for all United States Government space capabilities as well as selected commercial and foreign space capabilities.</p>

GENERAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

The purpose and intent of this contract is to secure services for pre-commercial thinning of approximately 275 acres of conifer reproduction, approximately 27 to 33 years old.  The Contractor must furnish all labor, equipment, housing, subsistence, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals except those items listed as Government-furnished property
 The performance period is 145 calendar days.

PROJECT LOCATION: 

All items are on northeast Prince of Wales Island.  Items 1-3 are in the Sweetwater Lake area, along Forest Roads 3030, 3030600 and 3030640.  Prince of Wales Island is part of the Thorne Bay and Craig Ranger Districts, Tongass National Forest, Alaska.  The project is approximately 24 air miles northwest of Thorne Bay and 4 air miles southwest of Coffman Cove.

Ketchikan is accessible via Alaska Airlines and the Alaska Marine Highway System.  Commercial floatplane services, based in Ketchikan, fly passengers and freight to communities and logging camps located on Prince of Wales Island.  The Inter-Island Ferry system provides vehicle and passenger service between the Hollis ferry terminal on Prince of Wales Island and Ketchikan.  A paved/gravel road system connects Hollis to most communities and logging camps located on Prince of Wales Island.  During the winter months, only the roads connecting the communities of Hollis, Craig/Klawock, and Thorne Bay are maintained and passable.  Barge lines in Seattle, Washington transport materials and equipment to Thorne Bay, Craig and Ketchikan.  

Because of the uniqueness of Southeast Alaska regarding access, logistics, and service points, it is strongly recommended that prospective Contractors adequately familiarize themselves with the area to help determine mobilization costs, living, and travel expenses.

SOLICITATION INFORMATION:

<AWARDEE>Near Space Systems, Inc., 2375 Telstar Drive, Suite 115, Colorado Springs, CO 80920 US
<DESC>NAVAIR/NAWCAD AIR-4.5, Advanced Development Program Office for Airship Concepts (ADPO-AC) has identified the need for an alternative energy, self-propelled, fully-maneuverable, hybrid, LTA, stratospheric airship to provide continuous communications and sensing capabilities over a large geographical area in support of the warfighter.  ADPO-AC created this requirement in response to the demands for real-time communications relays independent of cost, schedule, and risk factors associated with satellite based communications.  

The contractor shall design, analyze, and identify system architecture and subsystem requirements, preliminary designs of lower and upper stage subsystems, along with design and construction of subscale lower and upper stages.  The engineering requirements will be written to establish and define what the airship platform must have in terms of systems, structures, avionics, command and control, launch and recovery, performance and environmental expectations and safety considerations, in order to be a complete and operational aerial commodity.  A baseline configuration and performance model of an airship system will be established. A weight management program will be developed and in continual operation so that every component, assembly and sub assembly will be continually monitored for weight reduction and integration optimization.

This award is issued off of BAA N68335-10-R-0009 and will be a 1 year Cost Plus Fixed Fee effort.  This is the most appropriate type of contract, since there are uncertainties and risks associated with a research and development contract.  CPFF provides the Government control of delivery schedule, ease of redirection of effort and emphasis on performance objectives.

<DESC>Port Operations has 12 piers throughout NAVBASE SD area that has 483 synthetic log camels affixed to the quay walls and pier berths to protect the quay walls and piers from damage.  These synthetic log camels were installed in FY 04 for the support both 'Home Ported' and 'Visiting' ships in the San Diego area.  Due to normal wear and tear, many of the attaching fasteners, eye bolts, chains, hawse pipes and counter weights have become deteriorated through normal movement of the tides and have failed.  The failure of the chains has allowed many of the synthetic log camels to break free from there intended positions and become adrift causing a serious hazard to navigation for ships and small craft alike. Failure to conduct regular maintenance, repair or replace the supporting hardware, and reinstall the synthetic log camels will lead to more costly damage to the quay walls, piers and potentially ships as a navigational hazard.  The replacement of the worn and failing supporting hardware and reinstallation of the synthetic log camels is a critical requirement to ensure the safety of all vessels afloat.

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services,Inc., W91278-08-C-0013<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used because the contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures, as well as all equipment and vehicles to support the effort. The contractor has not only the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also, the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>The Western Wildland Environmental Threat Assessment Center (WWETAC) seeks to develop enhancements to an existing prototype web mapping system for wildland threats and values.  The target users for this application span an array of users from scientists, managers, specialists, and public interest groups.  We propose to develop enhancements to an existing cloud-based open source internet mapping application that will be accessible to WWETAC clients.  Initial prototypes have demonstracted funtionality with respect to performance, simplicity, and low cost.  The enhancements will improve the user interface and functionality of the map, and expand upon customization tools to included KML, AfcIMS, and ArcGIS Server layers.  Improvements will be made to guide the user while searching and selecting map servers and layers.  Additional effoerts will suport others within the agency setting up similar systems.  Finaly, a prototype wildland threat web crawler will be created to search and catalog wildland threats repoerted in online news websites.

<DESC>Justification for Other Than
Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) Document

The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and the Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 806.304.
	
1.  Agency Identification 
	
Department of Veterans Affairs (678)
Southern AZ VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS)
3601 S. 6th Avenue
Tucson, AZ 85723

2.  Description of Action Being Approved

This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition comes as a result of a request to purchase an upgrade to the existing patient care tracker system originally purchased from in 2005.  The system is used by the Rehabilitation and Transition Care Line (RTCL) at the Southern AZ VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS), Tucson, AZ for long term care patients.   Request to purchase sole source from Resource Systems, Inc. (parent company is Triplett & Adams), 140 S. Friendship Dr., New Concord, OH  43762-0129.  The price is estimated to be $39,006.00 for the complete upgraded system.  The original system was purchased from Resource Systems.  

 3.  Description  

The patient care tracker system to be upgraded provides an automated ability to track a variety of patient quality indicators and measurements used in daily patient care and was specifically designed to meet long term health care demands.  The system has proven to greatly increase accuracy and timeliness of patient record documentation and reduce duplication of same compared with the previous paper based system.  This results in improved patient outcomes and workload capture.  

The upgrade to the existing system will further improve upon the automated patient tracking attributes as part of the upgrade will provide hand held devices allowing nursing staff to record patient care data immediately as required at the point of care.

4.  Statutory Authority/Authority Cited  

The basis of this JOFOC is the criteria implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1,  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

(a) Authority. 
(1) Citations:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). 
(2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. 

5.  Reason for Authority Cited

The reason for citing FAR Part 6.302-1 as the statutory authority for this JOFOC is that it is
appropriate in this situation where the agencys needs could only be satisfied by the unique 
supplies/services available through Resource Systems, Inc.
  
Application. This authority shall be used, if appropriate, in preference to the authority in 6.302-
7; it shall not be used when any of the other circumstances is applicable. Use of this authority
may be appropriate in situations such as the following (these examples are not intended to be
all inclusive and do not constitute authority in and of themselves): 

	(1) When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by- 
(i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier 	with unique capabilities; 

6.  Demonstrate Proposed Contractors Unique Qualifications.  

This equipment purchase is a logical follow on purchase to upgrade the existing system.  The original system was a unique commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product and no other vendors provided information demonstrating similar systems on the market at the time of purchase in 2005.  This was borne out by a synopsis for the procurement in the Federal Business Opportunities system which did not bring forth any other interested parties.  Additionally, there are no known third party vendors offering this specific patient care tracker system so the system upgrade can only be readily obtained from Resource Systems.  Additionally, this vendor has proven to be a responsible company maintaining a current CCR and the D&B SQR indicates a 1 risk rating which is excellent.  

7.  Sources Sought Efforts.

The agency has done a market survey using the FSS Schedule sources, general searches over
the Internet, and CCR database for similar manufacturers.  As noted above no other potential
sources have been found for the system upgrade.  Though there are numerous vendors listed
in the SBAs resource database under the applicable NAICS code (511210) a review of a
representative sample did not indicate any specific providers for this software.  A review was
also done using the VetBiz.gov database with similar results.  A synopsis of the
requirement utilizing the FBO database, IAW FAR Part 5, will be issued to allow time for
other potential sources to be identified.  

8.  Determination of Fair/Reasonable Price.  	

The pricing for this open market purchase price is expected to be fair and reasonable based
on past cost experience with this vendor.  Additionally, a substantial discount off of the
vendors current published price list is expected to be offered.
