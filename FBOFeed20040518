This is a Market Survey to locate potential sources capable to perform overhaul and/or repair and/or upgrade for the list of Avionics Equipment identified below.  These Avionics equipment are used ma inly in the Army Rotary Wing Aircrafts AH-64( ) Apache/Long Bow, CH-47( ) Chinook, OH-58 Kiowa, or UH-60( ) Black Hawks. Traditionally and currently, the US Army CECOM Logistics Readiness Center (LRC) utilizes the Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) as a primary s ource to effect overhauls/repairs/upgrades.  Presently, the US Army CECOM LRC is interested in establishing additional complementary sources of overhaul/repair within the industrial base. Detailed technical data for the overhauls/repairs/upgrades of these equipments may be available from the US Army.  In some cases, special Test Equipment may be required to perform the required repair tasks.  Suppliers who wish to be considered capable of providing the repair capabilities for any of the avionics equipment l isted herein, must so indicate, by writing to Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N, Building 1200E, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5043.  The response should include documentation such as test results, copy of purchase order if your company was a vendor to the TYAD or Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Companies must also demonstrate that they have had past experience performing work on similar systems.  Companies will be required to warrant that the overhauled/repaired/upgraded systems will perform sati sfactorily when used for the intended purpose.  Companies must also have the knowledge and special test equipment to pre and post test the systems. For more information concerning the specific avionics equipment, please contact the individuals listed below  for that equipment.  The deadline for response is 08 June 2004.  This market survey does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate with the Bell-Boeing Joint Venture Team, RADM William A. Moffet Building, Suite 150, 47123 Buse Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547 on an other than full and open competitive basis for the “life-of-type buys” and “bridge buys” of V-22 tiltrotor production aircraft component level parts that are due to become obsolete.    Key avionics systems are experiencing component level obsolescence impacting the availability of avionics and VMS installs for production aircraft as well as supportability.   “Bridge buys” and “life-of-type buys” will be required as Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) discontinue manufacture of required parts and the program continues to receive End of Life (EOL) notifications.  These EOL notifications are distributed without long lead times.  Availability of key avionics boxes will be diminished, directly impacting the completion, delivery of new production V-22 aircraft, operational availability and sustainment of fleet products.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) plans to begin issuing Orders under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-04-C-0007 for these component level parts on or around 18 June 2004.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The Bell-Boeing Team is the designer, developer and sole producer of the MV-22 tiltrotor aircraft. Note Applicable to this synopsis (Sole Source)

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu CA intends to procure on a competitive basis AN/DSQ-50A Airborne Set, Sensor and Telemetry Downlink units, incidental Engineering and Technical Support Services, incidental Repair Services and Technical Data in accordance with NAWCWD Statement of Work, NAWCWD Performance Specification TGT-TAS-056 and Contract Data Requirement Lists (CDRLs).  It is anticipated that this requirement will be awarded during the period November 2004 through February 2005.  Contract award will be on either a First Article Require basis or on a First Article Waived Basis.  It is planned to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with Delivery Order 0001 being issued concurrent with contract award.  Delivery Order 0001 will meet the contract’s minimum order requirement.  Delivery Orders will be issued over a five-year period with pricing based on five one-year ordering periods.  Pricing of the AN/DSQ-50A units shall be on a fixed price basis and pricing for the Engineering and Technical Support Services and Repair Services shall be on a time and material basis.  The AN/DSQ-50A is used in conjunction with the AN/GSQ-228A Ground Set to measure miss distance between aerial and surface targets and a missile or 76-mm projectile during high and low altitude (sea clutter, multipath, and JEM lines present) endgame intercepts out to at least 75 feet.  The AN/DSQ-50A contains the non-cooperative sensor, telemetry downlink, and when required, encryption support circuitry, and a KGV-68(B) encryptor.  The AN/DSQ-50A and AN/GSQ-228A together form the AN/USQ-104 non-cooperative scalar scoring system.  The AN/DSQ-50A shall be compatible with the AN/GSQ-228A and the AN/TSM-195A (I-Level) and AN/TSM-196A (O-Level) test sets.  The AN/DSQ-50A has two configurations (encrypted and unencrypted versions) under which all scoring requirements shall be met.  The encrypted version incorporates encryption support circuitry with a removable KGV-68(B) encryptor.  Both AN/DSQ-50A configurations shall be identical in form and fit.  The AN/DSQ-50A includes a tunable telemetry transmitter in both D-Band (1435.5 - 1535.5 MHz) and E-Band (2200.5 - 2289.5 MHz) that is modulated by a NRZ-L PCM bit stream.  The AN/DSQ-50A includes a pulse Doppler radar sensor with a -20dB emission spectrum within 2417 MHz to 2450 MHz.  Six AN/DSQ-50A's shall operate simultaneously using omnidirectional antennas at a minimum distance of 200 feet from each other with no degradation to scoring performance (each AN/DSQ-50A shall be operating on a separate channel).  The AN/DSQ-50A radar receiver video output shall be capable of being configured to signal voltage compression factors of 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1.  The AN/DSQ-50A radar shall have an adjustable desensitized zone from the radar antenna out to at least 30 feet to minimize the effects of radar reflections from the carrying aerial and surface targets and shall have filtering to reject nearby (30 dB isolation between antennas) D-Band, E-Band, and 1810 - 1850 MHz telemeters.  The AN/DSQ-50A telemetry output shall not contain spurs nor phase noise that interferes with nearby (30 dB isolation between antennas) GPS L1 (1575.42 MHz) systems.  The maximum weight for the AN/DSQ-50A is 11.25 pounds.  For award with First Article Required, Delivery Order 0001 will be for six each First Article Units, one lot First Article Testing, one lot On-Site Flight Test Support and one lot First Article related Technical Data.  First Article testing shall be completed and the First Article Test report submitted no later than 395 days after issuance of the order.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine is seeking competitive proposals for systems technology and support to promote, extend, and broaden the user community for the Insight Toolkit (ITK), NLM’s open-source software initiative in image processing tools.  This requirement is set aside for small businesses.  The NAICS Code is 541512 and the Size Standard is Not-to-Exceed $21,000,000.  NLM is seeking proposals for a single award for (1) the support, maintenance, and extension of the ITK framework (including its infrastructure for C++ template-based generic programming, multiple language binding and wrapping capabilities for C++ templated code, and support for its distributed multi-platform source code control, test, and build environment); (2) user support through maintenance of mailing lists, development and refinement of new and existing documentation, control and maintenance of the existing automatic source-code documentation system, bug tracking, and answering in-depth questions about both the internal elements of the core ITK software as well as providing advice and guidance in the use of complex algorithms in ITK along with the setting of parameters for their control; and (3) promotion of ITK among an international community of medical image computing researchers through tutorials, presentations, and exhibits.  Ultimately, NLM hopes to migrate the Insight Toolkit as a foundation for future medical image understanding research away from its current dependence on federal funding for continuing support and maintenance toward a self-sustaining open-source software enterprise.  The Government anticipates a base year and four option years.  RFP NLM 04-101/VMS will be available in electronic format only.  Paper copies will not be issued.  The RFP may be downloaded on or about May 5, 2004 from FEDBIZOPPS.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST – TREATMENT OF INEEL CLASS B AND C MIXED LOW-LEVEL WASTE 

I.  INTRODUCTION   Bechtel, BWXT Idaho LLC (BBWI), Management & Operating Contractor of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is requesting an Expression of Interest (EOI) from firms to provide treatment of INEEL Class B and C mixed low-level waste. Treatment facilities must be privately owned and operated outside of areas managed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Treated waste may be returned to the INEEL if a mechanism for disposal is not available.  Appropriate licenses and permits obtained at vendor expense must be in place prior to award of the contract(s).  The amount of waste for which treatment is sought under this announcement is approximately 6 cubic meters (approximately 42 containers) to be treated in the July 2004 through September 2004 period. This EOI shall serve only as a method of establishing technical capabilities and commercial interest.  Qualified candidates may be invited to participate in follow-on technical/business discussions. 

II.  BACKGROUND The INEEL is a DOE National Laboratory located approximately 50 miles from Idaho Falls, Idaho and is comprised of several facilities, including nuclear research and development laboratories, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. The current work scope includes the treatment, transportation and disposal of MLLW generated by operations at the INEEL  

The mixed wastes to be treated include liquids, solids, sludges, debris, and particulate material.  The waste includes treatment and analytical residues, laboratory waste, paint chips, wash water, samples, soil and other non-debris solids subject to regulation under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and carrying many EPA waste codes.  The treatment groups and approximate volumes include stabilization (0.9 m3), PCB treatment (5 m3), and mercury treatment (0.1 m3).  The radioactive component of most of the subject waste is classified per Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 61.55 as Class B or Class C waste.  Radiation dose rates at contact with the waste containers range from < 0.1 mrem/hr to 270 mrem/hr.  Radiation dose rates at one meter from the waste containers range from <0.1 mrem/hr to 7 mrem/hr.  Services to be contracted include performing any necessary pretreatment as required prior to treatment, treating the waste to meet applicable regulatory standards and disposal facility waste acceptance criteria, storing treated waste at the treatment facility prior to disposal, and arranging for the transportation and disposal of the treated waste and any residuals in a permitted and licensed facility if available.  The treated waste must meet all regulatory and other applicable requirements for disposal. The Request for Proposal (RFP), if developed, will include detailed waste stream information.

III.  SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS Qualified respondents must provide two printed copies of the following information: company name, address, point of contact, email, phone/fax numbers, and a concise summary report that describes the capabilities of the respondent and a listing of all similar recent activities complete with reference names and telephone numbers, and copies of licenses and permits held including NRC and agreement state licenses for radioactive materials, and RCRA permits.  Respondents who provide insufficient information will not be considered further.  This EOI is totally separate from all other solicitations involving facilities or services for the treatment of INEEL mixed low-level waste (MLLW). 

Firms interested in responding should forward the requisite information to:  Mr. James A. Alberico, Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC, P.O. Box 1625, Mail Stop 4142, Idaho Falls, ID  83415-4142.  Responses by email, fax or telephone will be considered nonresponsive.  This solicitation will close on June 1, 2004.  If you have questions please contact Mr. Alberico at 208-526-0733 or email aaj@inel.gov.

Currently, Cytyc Corporation’s ThinPrep Systems resides in many of the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  The ThinPrep Pap Test provides the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved option for MTFs to perform Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing after receiving an ASCUS (positive) result, out of the ThinPrep vial.  During the life of this procurement, as funds become available, DoD customers have expressed interest in using Cytyc’s automated screening equipment, which read the slides automatically and will be procured under this solicitation.

Through Market Research it has been determined that Cytyc Corporation is the only FDA approved manufacturer for this bi-modal testing (dual FDA approval for both their ThinPrep Liquid Based Cytology and reflex Human Papilloma Virus testing).

These catalogs will be loaded in the DSCP Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of all items inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.
All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Confirmation and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s, and transmit 810-Invoice’s for payment.  There are (3) three communication option available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface, American National Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI Standard and the Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX).  Cytyc Corporation must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options. They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.

The Contract Award will be made using Competitive Proposal negotiation procedures for achieving the Best Value to the Government through the Source Selection (Tradeoff) Process, and will be made to the offeror whose Technical and Price Proposal combined, m eets the Government's needs in the most effective, economical, and timely manner. The technical evaluation criteria Factors to be used to determine the Best Value to the Government in the evaluation of Technical Proposals in descending order of importance are: Factor 1: Technical Approach, Factor 2: Past Performance, Factor 3: Proposal Risk and Factor 4: Cost/Price. In addition to the above Technical Proposal, a Price Proposal will be required to be submitted using the Price Schedule and other required form s provided in the Request for Proposal (RFP). A Government Estimate will be prepared and will be used in the consideration of Price Proposals. Price reasonableness that matches an offeror's technical approach is considered critical in the Government's Pric e Proposal consideration; however, award of a Contract will not be based solely on the lowest Price Proposal, Significant, unexplained differences where proposed prices do not match a proposed technical approach and risk involved, may result in a Proposal being removed from the Competitive Range. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions with all of the offerors within the Competitive Range. The Government also reserves the right to Award a Contract without discussions. All technical evaluati on criteria Factors other than Price when combined are significantly more important than Price.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to issue a purchase order to Dr. William A. Corrigall, 48 Highland Park Boulevard, Thornhill, Ontario L3T 1B3, Canada, on a  noncompetitive  to provide services in support of  NIDA's Nicotine and Tobacco Addiction Program research project.     The research is to conduct activities in the field of nicotine and tobacco addiction research in the areas of ligand discovery, disease mechanism discovery, model development, and the translation of preclinical discovery to early-stage development through multi-, inter-, and trans-disciplinary research efforts. Dr. Corrigall has a unique background and expertise on nicotine addiction using animal and human experimental paradigms. In the past, Dr. Corrigall joined NIDA as Chief of the Translational Research Branch and Director of the Nicotine and Tobacco.  Dr. Corrigall has made major efforts to support  NIDA's mission in drug addiction as it relates to tobacco.   He has designed several research meetings both for NIH staff and the research field in general, and regularly represented NIDA in cross-NIH efforts in the tobacco area.  He has organized, chaired and represented NIDA in several NIH Roadmap initiatives.   The tasks to be performed for this requirement are: 1) Monitor, assess and facilitate progress in the National Cooperative Drug Discovery Groups (NCDDG). 2) Evaluate and translate progress in the trans disciplinary Tobacco Use Research Centers. 3) Represent NIDA on the research teams of the future NIH roadmap initiatives.  4) Represent NIDA on the new pathways to discovery roadmap initiatives. 5) Develop new funding initiatives in the discovery and early stage development domain for nicotine and tobacco addiction.  6) Develop, chair and deliver scientific meetings and workshops in the nicotine and tobacco area that advance DNBR program efforts.    The determination by the Government not to compete this requirement was  based upon Dr. Corrigall's  performance, experience, knowledge and longstanding contacts in the area of nicotine research from receptor function to the delivery of treatments for NIDA's Nicotine and Tobacco Addiction Program.   Due to the benefits gained by NIDA from Dr. Corrigall's contributions to NIDA's Nicotine and Tobacco Addiction Program and in order to maintain continuity of the program, an award to any other source for this requirement would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The period of performance for this project is not expected to exceed twelve (12) months from the award date of the contract. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541710.  Size standard 500 employees is applicable to this requirement.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  Responses will be evaluated based upon past experience with the NIH, NIDA’s Nicotine and Tobacco Addition Program which is the critical component in the mission of NIDA for this requirement.   The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Responses must reference synopsis number NHLBI-PS-2004-069, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, Building RKL2, Suite 6042, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention Ms. Cecilia Morales, Purchasing Agent.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a one year cost reimbursement contract, with 3 option years, on a sole source basis to Orion Healthcare Technology.   The statutory authority for this sole source contract is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), per FAR 6-302.1.  It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded without competition since the purpose of this contract is to accelerate development and deployment of a web-based, substance abuse treatment information system that is culturally sensitive for Native American.  Orion Healthcare Technology is uniquely qualified to develop and deploy culturally sensitive treatment information services to Native Americans.   Orion’s unique capability is due to its unique combination of 3 factors: (1) Extensive, in depth experience with the publicly funded substance abuse treatment system across the Nation and specifically with Tribes.  Orion’s client assessment tools are used by over a third of Native American-based, treatment providers.  Other individual vender’s experience is limited to isolated areas; (2) An operational, Web-based (centrally hosted), treatment practice management and (HIPAA standard) billing system that is culturally sensitive to Native Americans.  Orion’s software automates a broad range of client assessment instruments and business process within an integrated, state-of-the-art, practice management system.  No other vender has a similar system in operation; and (3) Orion has extensive, long standing business relationships with Native American substance abuse treatment providers.  Past CSAT experience indicates that such relationships are critical in order to resolve technical IT deficiencies for Native American-based treatment programs.  No other vender has the range and depth of  relationships with Tribal organizations.   If responsible sources believe there are extenuating circumstances which would enable them to perform the requirement, they may submit proposals which will be considered by CSAT/SAMHSA.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.    Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   Interested parties may submit their proposals to Lynn Tantardini, Contract Specialist.  Responses will be received until July 1, 2004.*****

The following is the specification for an airborne surface search radar system for a USCG C-130 aircraft. Climate: The system shall be capable of operating between the following environmental conditions: Temperature: -35 to +50 degrees Celsius; Humidity:	 0 to 95% relative humidity; Altitude:-1000 to +35000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). The system shall be capable of withstanding non-operating temperatures from -50 to +65 degrees Celsius. Power Compatibility: The radar system shall be compatible with current HC-130H power available to include 115 Volt 3-phase 400 Hz Alternating Current (AC) Power and 28 Volt (V) Direct Current (DC) Power.  Imaging Radar: The radar shall have a high-resolution imaging or inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) mode. Target size & detection: The radar system shall be able to covertly detect targets of interest TOIs in support of the SDCIP task sequence.  TOIs may be subdivided into two major categories:  vessels dead in the water (DIW) and moving vessels.  These primary TOIs shall be detected from the following altitudes and ranges for a given target size.  Targets must be detected as shown in the table below: Vessel Length	Slant Range & Altitude (Above water level)NM / Feet Vessels greater than 150 feet in length:	200/27,000; Vessels greater than 50 feet but less than 150 feet in length:75,10,000;  Vessels greater than 15 feet but less than 50 feet in length:505,000 Life raft (with 1 person) 25, 2000. ISAR Target Resolution: Target resolution in the ISAR mode shall be no greater than one (1) meter. Compatibility with Existing Avionics Architecture: The proposed radar system shall provide the capability to provide direct input to the following existing sensor systems: (1)	CASPER system – The proposed system shall be capable of providing radar data in the form of RS232 interface.  Radar data consists of Track While Scan target information to allow the CASPER FLIR/EO Turret to slew on demand to a selected TOI. (2)	Inertial Navigation Unit (LN-100 RINU) – The proposed radar system shall be able to interface with existing HC-130 Avionics architecture in terms of Synchro outputs and Navigation data.  The LN-100 RINU provides the following: Synchro outputs for Pitch and Roll, True heading and Magnetic Heading; NAV data via INS data lines ARINC 561. (3)Altitude Data – The proposed Radar system shall interface with the existing HC-130 Avionics architecture for Altitude Data.  Altitude information can be obtained through the following methods: Encoding Altimeter (Grey Codes); Global Positioning System (GPS).
Surface Search Mode: The radar shall have a surface search mode and the following three modes:	MODE 1: designed for wide-area searches.MODE 2: designed for shorter range, low altitude (<3000 ft) searches for small targets.  The high antenna-scan rate, the radar pulse frequency and duration, and sophisticated data processing permit reduction in sea clutter and an amplification of small target return. MODE 3: wide-area search, but low antenna scan rate, which are suitable for navigation and can be used for target detection.
Radar Target Designation: The radar shall provide the means in the surface search mode for the operator to designate a target for tracking. Radar Track-While-Scan: The radar shall have a track-while-scan capability of up to 32 targets. Radar Composite Accuracy: The composite positional accuracy of the target displayed on the radar shall be within 100 meters at 5 nautical miles slant range.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) hereby issues a Request for Information (RFI) to identify sources capable of the operation of the Chemical Propulsion Information Analysis Center (CPIAC). The CPIAC is one of twelve contractor-operated DoD chartered Information Analysis Centers (IACs) which collect, analyze, synthesize, and disseminate scientific and technical information (STI) and promote standardization within their respective fields.  CPIAC is the focal point for activities related to the use of chemical, electrical, and nuclear propulsion technology-based programs related to tactical and strategic missiles, airbreathers, space and launch vehicles and guns.  The IACs’ mission is to improve the productivity of researchers, engineers, and program managers in the Defense research, development, and acquisition communities by collecting, analyzing, synthesizing, and disseminating worldwide scientific and technical information in clearly defined, specialized fields or subject areas.  The IACs’ secondary mission is to promote standardization within their respective fields.  They accomplish these missions by providing in-depth analysis services and creating products.  IACs respond to technical inquiries; prepare state-of-the-art reports, handbooks, and data books; perform technology assessments; and support exchanges of information among scientists, engineers, and practitioners of various disciplines within the scope or the IAC.  

The Chemical Propulsion Information Analysis Center (CPIAC) accesses, acquires, collects, analyzes, synthesizes, generates and disseminates scientific and technical information in specialized areas of propulsion technology.  The purpose of the CPIAC is: 1) to support the DoD research, development, test, acquisition and operational activities; 2) to assist DoD components/offices, other Government agencies, academia, Government contractors and U.S. industry as authorized, in the analysis and dissemination of the information within the chemical propulsion areas; and 3) to promote the exchange of technical information within the propulsion subject areas throughout DoD's research, development and acquisition communities.

The CPIAC will provide valuable assistance to military and commercial researchers and engineers in the areas of chemical, electrical, and nuclear propulsion. The CPIAC continually monitors and extracts related propulsion STI from worldwide engineering, technical and scientific information sources, including documents, databases, and electronic, paper, and other information media.  In order to facilitate use of STI, the CPIAC performs studies and analyses; collect, synthesize, and disseminate STI; develop and maintain inventories of relevant information, easily searchable and accessible information repositories, and experts; and provide scientific and technical advice to Government, industry, academia, and other approved domestic users.  The CPIAC ensures maximum use of the resources of other DoD IACs.  CPIAC information collection, analysis, and dissemination efforts should facilitate use of existing STI, while reducing unnecessary duplication of research, information collection and analysis, and information dissemination efforts.  The CPIAC should be operated in a manner that reduces incentives to establish redundant collection of propulsion related STI.  The CPIAC shall accomplish these objectives through methods that include, but are not limited to, the development and maintenance of anticipatory marketing of IAC products and services to STI users in Government, industry, and academia, as well as decision and policy makers in the RDT&E and acquisition communities.  The CPIAC shall seek out opportunities to provide chemical propulsion information to DoD components, other U.S. Government agencies and departments, their contractors, and other authorized users of CPIAC information and services.  The CPIAC has been in existence since 1964 and is still necessary to DoD needs.  CPIAC is currently operating under contract SP0700-97-D-4004, which expires 31 July 2004.  In order to maintain CPIAC as a center of technical excellence for chemical propulsion technology, the continuity of operations is essential; therefore, award of a thirty-six month basic contract period, with one, twenty-four month option period is anticipated.  A draft Statement of Work is hereby attached.

<DESC>The General Services Administration is requesting comments from parties interested in supplying renewable energy certificates (RECs) to GSA facilities from renewable generation sources in various states.  The area of primary focus would be for GSA facilities in deregulated electricity markets.  The contracting approach presented for comment attempts to satisfy several goals simultaneously.  Those goals are to purchase renewable energy for GSA via RECs; to provide stable pricing for REC suppliers; and to protect GSA from significant increases in electric commodity prices during the term of the contract.  The proposed contract term is ten (10) years, but shorter contract terms would be possible.  A priced ten (10) year option term could also be considered.  GSA envisions the proposed contracting structure working with both new and existing renewable resources.  In particular, GSA is looking for comments regarding the proposed pricing structure.  While PJM pricing points are referenced, other transparent pricing points in New England and New York could be used.  GSA also is interested in any optimum size for procurements of this sort (i.e. 50,000,000 kWh annual requirements for instance).  GSA envisions a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement method conducted in accordance with Part 12 (Commercial Item) of the FAR.  GSA plans to conduct procurements of this sort on an unrestricted basis.  The NAICS Code for this procurement would be 221119.    GSA requests comments be submitted by June 30, 2004 via email to ken.shutika@gsa.gov preferably in a Microsoft Word document.   Contact Mr. Ken Shutika on (202) 260-9713 (ken.shutika@gsa.gov) if you have any questions.

<DESC>1.    Introduction This document is intended to provide sufficient information for suppliers to determine whether they are willing to participate in a more detailed selection process.  It will enable the suppliers to provide sufficient information for the Harmony Program to select a shortlist to which a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued.  It is not intended that suppliers prepare detailed proposals for this RFI.  It is important that the supplier provide basic information regarding capabilities and an indication, in b road terms, as to how they would approach working with the Harmony Program to achieve the objectives set out in this document. 1.1	Overview of Harmony Program  History of Harmony Program at NGIC The Harmony concept originated as an effort to develop a community tool for managing previously uncoordinated DoD foreign document acquisition and translation efforts. The Harmony Program has been selected as the National system for disseminating foreign d ocuments and electronic media and their translations to the Intelligence, DoD and National Law Enforcement communities.  The Army was named as the executive agent and NGIC designated the program manager.   Harmony Program Strategic Objectives Harmony is a collaborative effort to provide a community-wide reference to foreign technical, military and open source documents, media and their translations.  Harmony is a living bibliographic database that reflects the daily acquisition and translation activities of participating agencies.  Harmony provides timely and unique access to thousands of foreign documents, electronic media and translations of critical importance to national security and protection of forces deployed around the world.  The Harmo ny database is an important tool for enabling the coordinated screening, identification, translation, exploitation and dissemination of these materials.  Harmony also provides analysts throughout the intelligence community with the raw materials for studyi ng foreign military, scientific and technical capabilities. 1.2	Description of Harmony  Ã¢Â€Â¢	A comprehensive reference to foreign documents and translations of community interest Ã¢Â€Â¢	A tool for coordinating community document acquisition, exploitation and translation efforts Ã¢Â€Â¢	A means for quickly disseminating documents collected in remote locations around the world (along with their translations) to customers via secure networks. Ã¢Â€Â¢	A web accessible Oracle database with a powerful Verity K2 search engine and hyperlinks to scanned foreign documents, electronic files and translations Ã¢Â€Â¢	A tool for conserving scarce translation funds 1.3	Project Overview The project goal is the integration of audio and video files within the current Harmony framework.  The solution should provide the ability to store large amounts of audio and video files and serve them over secure web-accessible networks.  The solution mu st enable audio and text files to be searched simultaneously in both their native language and, where machine translation is applicable, in English. 2	Requirements 2.1	Business Requirements  There are currently approximately 10 TB of digitized multimedia holdings to be integrated into the Harmony framework.  There is a need to encode, index, store and serve out the multimedia holdings in an efficient manner.  The goal is to allow customers to search and retrieve those portions of the multimedia content relevant to their mission 2.2	Overview of Software Requirements The NGIC Harmony Program Office core requirements are for a new system that shall: Ã¢Â€Â¢	Process large amounts of audio and video files Ã¢Â€Â¢	Provide full content indexing of audio and video files Ã¢Â€Â¢	Provide machine translation capabilities for foreign language audio files into English, with Arabic language as a minimum Ã¢Â€Â¢	Provide both English and foreign language search capability Ã¢Â€Â¢	Allow users to search both audio and existing text files simult aneously Ã¢Â€Â¢	Stream audio and video files over web accessible networks Ã¢Â€Â¢	Incorporate non-proprietary solutions and standards wherever possible. 2.3	Hardware and Software Integration Requirements Harmony is a web-accessible Oracle database system operating on UNIX servers and served over web-accessible networks.  Harmony is accessible via Microsoft Internet Explorer 5+ and Netscape 4.7+ and uses the Verity K2 search engine for product dissemination . The current architecture is a centralized database that resides at NGIC linked to a distributed storage of document and media files at locations accessible via the web.

<DESC>The 42d Contracting Squadron, Maxwell AFB AL, intends to award, on a sole source basis, for curriculum development for the College for Enlisted Professional Military Education (CEPMR).  This is a continuation of effort to complete an initial project   awarded in June 2003.

The current contractor has worked hand-in-hand with military members and is familiar with all aspects of the plans,  materials and lessons. All material builds upon each other, therefore, developers working on the project must have a working knowledge of all lessons involved in the courses.  It is critical that the lessons that are in the works be developed and finished, without interruption, by the same team.  The Government intends to award a purchase order to Knowledge Management Solutions, Inc., 2005 Cobbs Ford Road, Prattville AL 36066-7714.  A solicitation will not be issued.  This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  A firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded.  The POC for this action is Mary Peters; email is mary.peters@maxwell.af.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22. 

****The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible Parties may submit a quote.

****The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for one (1) Half Body Radioactive Contamination Personnel Monitor with state of the art PC based components, background correction algorithms, and remote alarm notifications.  The counter will be used in clearance monitoring for beta surface contamination on personnel leaving laboratories.  All interested parties shall provide a quote for the following line items:

****LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each Half Body Radioactive Contamination Personnel Monitor with the following required specifications:

Functional Requirements:

**The Personnel Contamination Monitor (PCM) shall automatically detect the presence of beta emitting contamination on clothes, or exposed skin, of the person while standing in the unit.  The PCM shall alarm and notify the user if the contamination exceeds 5000 DPM per100 square centimeters; 

      ** The unit shall be capable of fully monitoring the head, hands, feet, legs, arms, and trunk of an individual for surface contamination in no more than a two-step process (i.e front and back OR side and side).  The PCM shall use a full coverage contour that assures monitoring of the palm and back of the hands, top, bottom, and sides of shoes, face and head, arms, legs and torso so as to optimize detector geometric efficiency.  The total covered area shall not be less than 8000 square centimeters;

**The unit shall have not less than fifteen zones, or separate detectors, so that the location of detected contamination is indicated.  The algorithm shall also provide a sum zone or distributed contamination detection capability; 

**Each detector zone shall cover at least 250 cm squared for each location and allow for an open area of at least 58 percent where transmission is not impeded by grids or supports.  The mesh on the grid must be tight enough to prevent the detectors from being ruptured by small objects such as a dropped pen. Separate detectors are required for each monitored zone;

**The PCM algorithm shall incorporate sum zone logic to combine response of adjacent detectors to alarm for low levels of generally distributed contamination.  User selectable confidence levels shall be part of the combining algorithm;

**The PCM shall be capable of detecting contamination of S-35 with maximum beta energy of 0.167 MeV. Other contamination isotopes to be detected include C-14, Sr-90, P-32, U-238, I-125, I-131.  The monitor shall have a minimum efficiency of 10 percent for a point source of Co-60;

**The PCM shall be capable of alarming for performance testing with 0.01 microCuries (uCi) of  Strontium-Yitrium-90 and 0.1 uCi of Cs-137 within less than 30 seconds while operating in a variable external gamma background condition ranging from 0.005 to 2 millirems (mrem) per hour;

**The PCM shall be able to detect 5000 DPM per 100 square centimeters of Cs-137 at one inch from a detector with a 90 percent probability of detection and a 0.1 percent false alarm rate. The maximum count time shall not exceed 15 seconds while operating in a 20 uR per hour background field;

**The PCM shall automatically sense the presence of the user and start the counting sequence.  These sensors shall assure the user is positioned close enough to the detectors optimize detection geometry.  Manual buttons or switches that must be pushed by the user will not satisfy this requirement;

**The PCM shall use audible and visual indicators notify the user of the count sequence status;

** The PCM shall include a frisking probe with alarming capabilities for checking tools, equipment, wheels on carts, and other items.  Cable lengths for the probe must be at least five (5) feet long;

**The frisking probe shall include either audible OR visual notification to the user in order to gauge the response while the user cannot directly view the main display on the monitor unit;

**The monitor shall have both audible and visual indication of an alarm and location of the detector originating the alarm.  The display must be readable by the user.  This may be accomplished either by maintaining the displayed results long enough (30 seconds or greater) for the user to review them after leaving the monitoring position OR by placing the display where it can be seen during use; The PCM shall have a user selected automatic hard copy printout when the count indicates contamination.  

**The monitor shall include connections to allow remote alarm notifications.  The PCM also shall be capable of communicating system status, alarm conditions, or other parameters to a remote computer via secure LAN twisted pair or TCP-IP connections; 

**The monitor shall include provisions for a printout (i.e. a printer port) OR easily readable computer file documenting alarm conditions and usage history that NIST Health Physics staff may review either upon response to an alarm or during normal daily rounds.  The printer shall be supplied with the unit;

**The monitor shall be PC based to allow easy upgrade of the program and supporting files (such as audio WAV (audio command) files, onscreen instructions etc) as needed;   

**The computer and all detector electronics shall be enclosed and mounted inside the cabinet so that there are minimal outside cables and connections except what is required for printers and IO devices; 

**The computerized controlling program shall incorporate automated routines for performing instrument set-up and quality assurance.  These routines shall include automated high voltage plateaus, discriminator threshold and window settings, background and efficiency trending for each detector.  The system shall be able to produce data file reports and hard copy printouts to document QA testing and trends;  

**Setup, Quality Assurance (QA), and diagnostics program interface shall be onscreen menu driven so that a technician can perform these functions without substantial reference to the hard copy tech manual;  

**The PCM algorithm shall incorporate a means for a single individual to perform all QA source response and alarm checks.  It shall not be required for a single technician to hold the source close to each detector and simultaneously operate an IO device or position sensor;  

**The controlling algorithm shall include alarm point settings, calibration efficiencies, and readout units that may be adjusted by NIST Health Physics staff; 

**The algorithm shall include maximum count time settings, not to exceed 30 seconds and minimum sensitivities (MDA) that are selectable by NIST Health Physics staff.  The system manager (NIST HP) shall have the option to select a fixed count time with variable sensitivity based on variable background OR using a fixed sensitivity with a varying count time based on the variable background;  

**The programs shall allow for diagnostic and setup utilities including individual detector “real time” rate meters, individual detector background history trend graphs, individual detector bias High Voltage (HV) plateaus and threshold setup utilities, individual detector efficiencies, and individual and grouped alarm point settings; 

**The algorithm shall include an automatic background update to correct the active count.  This shall be based on a rolling average with times that shall be adjustable by the NIST HP staff;  

**The PCM shall temporarily suspend operations going “Out of Service” and notify users on screen if a step change in background or other fault condition such as a low “failed detector” count rate or a high “contaminated detector” count rate occurs that prevents the unit from reliably alarming for the specified levels of sensitivity.  The unit shall return to service when background or fault conditions return to normal;  

**The algorithm shall be capable of compensating for “self shielding” of the background when a user steps into, or approaches, the unit;

**The PCM shall include provisions for the user to save the background, usage, and QA and maintenance history via a computer file OR print out while the monitor remains available for normal contamination monitoring.  The algorithm shall include a mode to automatically and periodically transmit this data to an external PC, a computer disk, or a printer.  Preference shall be given to systems that store the data internally in an easily retrievable, readable, and transferable manor; 

**The monitor shall automatically reset to the user specified parameters and return to service following any power interruptions;

**The monitor shall be designed to minimize operating and maintenance requirements.  Preference shall be given to sealed proportional detectors over flow-through units. Solid-state detectors will be considered if it can be demonstrated or documented that they meet the same alpha/beta detection capability requirements and are not overwhelmed by external background fluctuations;

**The system shall be delivered with all components and accessories necessary for data input/output and programming control including, but not limited to, computer, keyboard, mouse or track ball, monitor, printer, plugs, and cables;  

**The system IO connections shall be arranged for easy access.  The ports shall be located on the front or sides of the instrument so as not to be blocked by placement of the PCM close to walls;  

**The monitor components shall be designed for easy access for decontamination and repair.  All decontaminations, repairs, or component replacements shall be possible without the use of specialized tools, relocation of the PCM unit, or substantial technical support from the manufacturer.  Where possible, all detectors and supporting electronics shall be of similar design so as to be fully interchangeable.  It must be possible to take some detectors out of service without fully disabling the PCM; 

**With the exception of the detector windows, the unit shall be capable of being cleaned with standard cleaning supplies and equipment;

**The PCM shall have a maximum footprint of 54 inches x 52 inches and maximum height of 92 inches.  It must be possible to transfer the unit through 6 foot 10 inch high x 47-inch wide doorways.  This should be able to be accomplished by tipping the unit on its side or back and turning it through the door or by some minimally disruptive disassembly;

**The unit shall operate on standard 115 to 125 Volt 15 amp 60 hz ac power.  The unit shall be delivered with appropriate surge suppression/uninterruptible power supply to minimize the impact of power surges or disruptions;

**The Contractor shall provide a list of the system’s spare parts inventories including current prices and estimated delivery times.  Preference shall be given to systems that have spare parts available for delivery to NIST within two-weeks after notification of need.

<DESC>The Geography Division, United States Census Bureau (Census Bureau) is conducting a competition in accordance with PL 92?582 (Brooks Architect?Engineer Act) and FAR 36 to enter into a contract with period of performance from award date through September 30, 2008. This contract is for collection of accurate coordinate datasets to support the coordinate evaluation of TIGER files that have been processed through the MAF/TIGER Accuracy Improvement Project (MTAIP) coordinate improvement operations.  Also coordinate evaluation data is required to evaluate the location accuracy of Geographic Information System (GIS) files and other files that are potential sources of spatial data, for which the spatial accuracy must be statistically evaluated and the results recorded in the metadata.  It is anticipated that from contract award through GFY 2008 coordinate QA will be required for up to 1200 areas. The schedule is dependent on a number of factors beyond the Census Bureau’s control.  Consequently the contract type is anticipated to be an Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract with individual task orders for a well-defined workload of a definite number of named counties or areas.  Each task order will be priced as a fixed price task order.  This task requires the collection via creation or procurement of coordinate QA evaluation datasets.  The Census Bureau requires these Coordinate QA datasets to determine the coordinate accuracy of local government supplied GIS files, other coordinate source files, and coordinate enhanced TIGER files.  The project shall be known as “Accurate Coordinate Datasets Collection (ACDC).”

The anticipated award date is September 9, 2004.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the Census Bureau.  A solicitation document will be published electronically on May 18/19, 2004 on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Web site at two locations.
