<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with the Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum (APIAHF), San Francisco, CA, to further develop the Asian American Health Website.  The period of performance is one (1) year with one one-year option period. 

In 2003, NLM launched the Asian American Health Website in order to increase knowledge about Asian Americans and their health status by providing current, accurate and culturally-appropriate health research and clinical information for and about Asian Americans.   The information on the website is targeted to health consumers, providers and researchers.

NLM plans to collaborate with APIAHF to further develop, expand the content and promote the use of the website.  Specifically, APIAHF shall:

1.	Establish a users board composed of professionals in research, data collection, health care, public health, and member of community-based organizations, schools, institutions that will work with APIAHF to act as an advisory body to provide guidance on the development of NLM’s Asian American Health Website and to develop and promote the website.

2.	Analyze, assess and provide recommendations for the expansion and enhancement of NLM’s Asian American Health Website with regard to content and usability.

3.	Develop protocols and an implementation plan for the improvement and maintenance of the NLM Asian American Health Website.

APIAHF is uniquely qualified to provide these services.  APIAHF is a national organization dedicated to promoting policy, program and research efforts for the improvement of health status of all Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.  The mission of the APIAHF works closely with other Asian American and Pacific Islander organizations and the Asian American community in general.  This is a unique organization for NLM to work with in this health information development and dissemination project because they are the only organization devoted to broadly working on health promotion and improvement of the Asian American community at both the national and community level.  They are unique in having the technical expertise to work with electronic health information resources and also the community involvement necessary to this project.  APIAHF has the knowledge to identify the appropriate organizations and communities with which to work as well as the credibility needed to negotiate for the use of the NLM we site of health information resources not currently in digital format.  In addition, the promotion of the use of this web site within the Asian American community is a critical part of this project and APIAHF is well situated to accomplish that task. 

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.

<DESC>Arcata Associates, Inc. (Arcata) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) AAI020410-04-001 on behalf of the Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) for the procurement of a Transportable Range Acquisition System (TRACS) on or about 24 September 2004.  Proposals are due on or about 1 November 2004. The WATR operates and maintains various systems and subsystems for gathering data for space flight and aeronautical mission support.	The WATR is looking for innovative ways to reduce the number of “high value/high cost assets” currently used to communicate with research vehicles.  Arcata will be conducting a solicitation to replace multiple, individual range instrumentation systems (i.e. telemetry (TM), voice communications, Flight Termination System (FTS) & optics pedestals) with a single, transportable, multi-purpose tracking system that incorporates all of these capabilities.  This system will be referred to hereafter as TRACS.

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; no written solicitation will be issued.  Solicitation No. DTRS57-04-R-20008 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13.5 and Part 15. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24. The NAICS Code is 336510 and the Small Business size standard is 1,000 employees. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Contract and to solicit and negotiate on full and open basis. Award  will be made to the low cost technical acceptable offeror. Proposals shall include technical information and pricing for the following item in a written quotation: CLIN 0001 – Up to 3 Electric Hybrid Switcher Locomotives   EA $______ Total: $______; CLIN 0002A Delivery of one Electric Hybrid Locomotive to Fort Lewis, WA 1EA $ ______$______Total; CLIN 0002B Delivery of one Electric Hybrid Locomotive to the US Army Barstow, CA; 1 EA $_____¬$______Total; CLIN 0002C Delivery of one Electric Hybrid Locomotive to the US Army at Sierra, CA 1EA $______ $______Total.  The following are the specifications for this procurement.  Specifications and General Requirements For Three Electric-Hybrid Switcher Locomotives 1. Compliance This procurement will consist of three commercial off-the-shelf e lectric-hybrid switcher locomotives with 2,000-HP equivalent tractive effort.  It shall be verified that the product specified herein has been used and tested by major railroads and the U. S. military.  This Request for Proposals is not intended to provide developmental costs, engineering costs or procedures to produce hybrid locomotives.  For the purposes of this procurement, electric-hybrid means that tractive effort is provided entirely on battery power where the batteries in turn will be recharged by the engine generator set on an as needed basis only.  There shall be no parallel hybrid-electric drivetrain configurations allowed.  Locomotives with parallel hybrid-electric drivetrain configurations are considered as locomotives that obtain tractive effort from power delivered from an en gine generator set in combination with battery power for additional tractive effort.  This requirement is due to the location, type of use, and environmental considerations where the locomotives will be operating.   Electric-hybrid locomotives, due to their large bank of batteries, exhibit longer run times on battery power only (without the startup of the genset).  This requirement is to provide safer conditions while operating in hazardous areas and as an environmental requirement for noise and emissions.   The electric hybrid locomotives in this specification shall provide better fuel efficiency, less pollution and quieter operations when compared to parallel diesel-electric switcher locomotives in the 1,000 to 2,000 horsepower range.  The typical values required in this specification  are 80% or higher drop in NOX and particulate matter and 50% or higher drop in greenhouse gases. Any and all locomotive reconditioning must comply with all of the following documents: a)	Association of American Railroads (AAR) Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices b)	AAR Interchange Rules 2003 edition c)	The Official Railway Equipment Register d)	Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49, Transportation e)	American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Boiler and Pressure Code Section IX, Welding Qualifications f)	 American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), A53 – Pipe, Steel, Black and Hot-Dipped, Zinc-Coated, Welded and Seamless g)	 American Welding Society (AWS), D15.1 – Railroad Welding Specification h)	 American Iron and Steel (AISI) Standards i)	Inter national Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 and 12th cycle (9002) j)	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Association Standards k)	National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards 2.

<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy intends to award a sole source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Brodart Company dba McNaughton Book Service  This service is being acquired for the USAF Academy Community Center Library, 10 SVS/SVMG.  The current service enables the library to provide quick customer access to fiction bestsellers and current-interest nonfiction.  The current service also allows the library to return items that are not circulating well or are of interest for only a short time instead of having them in a permanent collection.  It is estimated a change in book services would precipitate a 90 day disruption of service.  Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.  No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  If no response is received by 26 August 2004, to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services though a sole source procurement with McNaughton Book Service a sole source award will be made.

FAR 52.217-8 AND 52.217-9 Option to extend contract.   The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items, applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation’s minimum criteria for technical acceptability at the lowest price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. (Factor 1) To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must furnish product literature that demonstrates the products offered meet all requirements stated in the above purchase descriptions for Line Items 0001.  (Factor 2) Past Performance, contractors to submit previous three (3) contract numbers, names of agencies/companies and contacts for past three years.  (Factor 3) price  Offerors’ proposals will be evaluated first under factor 1 above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award. See paragraph b below. Only those offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor 1 will be further evaluated under Factors 2 and 3.  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor 1 to be technically acceptable., Factor 2 is approximately equal to Factor 3, price. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b) Technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement, Factor 1, will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to offerors – commercial items, subparagraph (b) 4 which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors’ technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors’ technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technical unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically  unacceptable may not be considered further for award. © Offeror’s Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors – Commercial items, Subparagraph (6) 10, will be used  to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as in attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offeror’s proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror’s past performance as follows: Neutral:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. Outstanding:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degration of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror’s past performance. Satisfactory:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror’s past performance. Marginal:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror’s past performance. (d) Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (of part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of  withdrawal is received before award.

The development site is located approximately 60 miles east of Reno and three miles south of the town of Fallon.  A 7,000 ft. deep discovery well was drilled there in August of 1993 and was successfully flow-tested.  The maximum temperature that was recorded was 376 degrees F.  The developer will be responsible for all phases of erecting and operating a geothermal electrical power plant on Navy land, including finance, research, exploration, design, acquisition, construction, installation, testing, operation, maintenance, repair, and sale of electrical power.   Compensation to the Navy, as well as the terms and conditions of the agreement, are subject to negotiation.  The Navy does not intend to directly purchase any of the output of the facility.  The developer will be responsible to sell the power generated in accordance with the Public Utility Regulatory Administration (PURPA) regulations.  The selection process will include an evaluation of the past performance of offerors in three areas: technical, as it relates to geothermal resource exploration and exploitation; experience in managing commercial-scale electricity production projects; and financial capability of the proposing entity.  The resulting agreement will reflect sound business practices. The Navy intends to enter into agreement with the responsible party whose offer represents the best value to the Navy and greatest possibility of project success.  This solicitation will be available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY.   All solicitation (or RFP) documents and solicitation amendments will be posted on the NAVFAC E-Solicitation (E-SOL) Website at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil/.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for a second and third harmonic generation (SHG and THG) of 608-687nm laser light to produce 203-229nm.	The unit must be autotracking. Beam diameter of dye laser ~ 5.5mm	    AT-III-UV Harmonic Generation System including controller and optical assembly for UV generation of a vertically polarized laser and including FR-f reflective filter, Neutral Density Filters, and Adjustable Height Legs (AHL-1)	   NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Inrad, Inc., of Northvale, New Jersey.    Only the Autotracker III, from Inrad, fulfills our requirements.  They manufacture the frequency-tracking units as well as the nonlinear optical crystals needed to triple the frequency of our laser to reach the 203-229nm range.  Competing systems either may reach our wavelength requirement of 203 nm or they do so by frequency doubling the dye laser output.  Our dye laser is not equipped to operate in the wavelength region (406-458nm) where the frequency doubling the output is an option.

TITLE: DYNAMIC AIR AND SPACE EXECUTION AND ASSESSMENT (DASEA)

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 04-07-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 22 Oct 04; FY 06 by 1 Jun 05; and FY 07 by 1 Jun 06.White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Aug 2007, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Objective: The overall objective of this BAA is to design, develop and demonstrate a capability for continuous effects-based execution and assessment in a dynamic tasking environment.  This program will employ, exploit and develop as necessary technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide for spiral development and interaction with other ongoing Air Force programs.  Familiarity with  initiatives that are focused on dynamic tasking and effects based assessment, as well as those technologies that are necessary to support these functions (e.g. multi-INT fusion) are desirable.  Specific efforts targeted for collaboration include: 1. the Command and Control Battle Lab's T-BONE effort which is focused on rewriting the Theater Air Planning (TAP) capability and the Air Operations Database (AODB).  2. Air Combat Command's Effects Based Assessment initiative. 3. DARPA's JAGUAR (Joint Air-Ground Unified Adaptive Re-planning) program.  4. AFRL's PANACIA (Predictive Awareness and Network-Centric Analysis for Collaborative Intel Assessment).  And 5. AFRL/HE's AOC Strategy Planning and Operational Effects Assessment Visualization Effort (04-01-HE-04).   In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complimentary activities including test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, and data collection and management.

Background: The current planning process for air operations takes commander's intent and turns it into orders that executing units carry out. Mission data and orders are documented and sent to executing units in a batch-oriented Air Tasking Order (ATO). To counter emerging threats or exploit emerging opportunities, commanders require the means of reacting very quickly. This argues against a batch-oriented process and towards a more continuous process.  In the near future, executing orders might be available in a Dynamic Air/Space Execution Order (DAEO) or in a continuous "streaming ATO".  This envisions a largely continuous process where target queues are dynamically executed as they are built.  Crucial to a DAEO or streaming ATO process is the ability to conduct effects based assessment (EBA).  Assessment activities need to begin well before tasks are executed. During the planning process, assessment requirements are an integral part of the DAEO generation. During execution, assessment activities need to determine the likelihood that the course of action will attain commander's intent. The focus of combat assessment today is on actions rather than effects and results in recommendations concerning re-attacks.  In addition to re-attack recommendations, effects based assessment must look at whether the basic strategy of the campaign or major operation should be changed.  This Critical Experiment will result in a capability to continually plan, execute, assess and respond to changes in guidance, resources, or situation in such a manner as the control apparatus matches, or exceeds the speed of command.  Technologies to support the required capabilities will need to rapidly explore options, reason about the impact of choices, and understand trade-offs as part of a modified joint air tasking cycle that is based on the streaming ATO emerging concept.  Effects based assessment methods for a streaming ATO need to be developed.  Both quantitative and qualitative methods for reasoning under uncertainty in a dynamic environment should be explored.  Note, this effort is focused on exploiting multi-INT fusion capabilities, not developing them.  



II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $10,000,000.  $5,500,000 has been approved by AFRL and $4,500,000 of customer support and other agency funding is anticipated to augment Air Force funding. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $1,000,000; FY 06 - $2,250,000; and FY 07 - $6,750,000.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $75,000 to $400,000 per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.
The anticipated start date for the FY05 efforts under the solicitation is early in February/March 2005.

The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict their white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.  

3.  SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 22 Oct 04; FY 06 by 1 Jun 05; and FY 07 by 1 Jun 06.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Aug 2007, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.   Submission of white papers will be regulated in accordance with FAR 15.208.

4.  FUNDING RESTRICTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.   Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS). 

5.  OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Joseph A.

Electronic submission to Joseph.Caroli@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.  Reference BAA 04-07 in the subject line.


V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are equal in importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Scientific and technical merit including creativity of proposed solution to the problem, (2) Soundness of offeror's proposed approach to developing and testing dynamic execution and effects based assessment capabilities, (3) Understanding of the dynamic tasking and effects based assessment problem.  This includes the offeror's understanding of current approaches and military doctrine in these areas. (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed cost and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will be reviewing the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a secret or top secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to secret or top secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.


3.  REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Joseph A. Caroli, telephone: (315) 330-4205 or email Joseph.Caroli@afrl.af.mil.  

Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori L. Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil

The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.

All responsible organizations may submit a white paper which shall be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>W912DQ-04-R-0024
<RESPDATE>113004
<ARCHDATE>01292005
<CONTACT>Rosalind M. Whitfield, (816)983-3923
<DESC>DESCRIPTION The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District intends to issue a full and open competition solicitation on or about October 15, 2004 for the Tuttle Creek Dam Foundation Modification Project, located in Manhattan, Kansas.  This will be a Constructi on Manager at Risk project.  The scope of services under this proposed contract includes Preconstruction Services with options for a Test Program, Geotechnical Baseline Report, Cutoff Wall Installation, and Construction.  A fixed-price contract is contempl ated.  The contractor will be competitively chosen using Best Value Source Selection procedures.  For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs).   PROJECT INFORMATION Tuttle Creek Dam is located on the Big Blue River, in the Kansas River basin, approximately 6 miles north of the City of Manhattan in eastern Kansas.  Tuttle Creek Lake covers approximately 12,500 surface acres at normal pool with over two million acre-fee t of storage below the flood control pool. The dam is a rolled earth fill and hydraulic fill embankment, 7,500 feet in length, standing 137 feet high with a crown width of 50 feet and a base width of 1,050 feet on an alluvial foundation. The dam is located  in a zone of moderate seismicity dominated by the Nemaha Ridge and Humboldt fault zone.    Seismic and geotechnical investigations have established that an earthquake larger than a 5.7 magnitude could cause liquefaction of the foundation sands and potential failure of the embankment. The Maximum Credible Earthquake for consideration at the dam i s a 6.6 magnitude. Depending on the magnitude of the earthquake, significant deformation of the entire embankment, and release of the lake is possible.  In order to address the risk of embankment breach during an earthquake, the foundation under the embankment is to be stabilized using jet grouting to mix cement into the foundation sands under the upstream slope of the dam and deep soil mixing to accomplis h similar goals beneath the downstream slope of the dam. This ground modification project could potentially involve the treatment of over 400,000 cubic yards of soil.  A cement cutoff wall that extends to bedrock beneath the dam to depths of up to 180 feet  to stop normal seepage through the sand beneath the dam is also required.  The project web site is http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/projects/tcdam/index.htm.  The Tuttle Creek Evaluation Report and Environmental Impact Statement are available for download fr om the web page and will be included in the solicitation for specific background on the project.  Report appendixes not included in electronic format are available in hard copy from the Project Management point of contact listed below.  Historic contract d rawings and historic subsurface information will also be provided with the solicitation.   SERVICES REQUIRED The Contractor must provide personnel, equipment, and materials as needed to perform all required services including, but not limited to, those described in this solicitation.   The Contractor must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manag e and coordinate the timely and orderly services during preconstruction, test program, geotechnical baseline report, cutoff wall installation, and construction of the proposed project.  The Contractor shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisti ng of appropriate construction professionals.  The Contractor is expected to maintain the same team from preconstruction services through completion of construction. The Contractor shall assist the Government during the preconstruction phase by participating in the review and evaluation of the design and construction documentation.  The Contractor is required to work with the Board of Consultants (a team of five to sev en experts in ground modification) and the Government in a cooperative team effort to develop a quality design .  The Contractors principal tasks during the preconstruction phase are as follows: 1.	Reviewing and evaluating designs for completeness and constructibility. 2.	Development of a test program plan. 3.	Preparing cost estimates and construction schedules. 4.	Evaluating costs for design alternatives. 5.	Conducting VE analyses as needed to support cost and constructibility initiatives. 6.	Performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work. This award is only for the preconstruction phase of the Tuttle Creek Dam Foundation Modification Project.  Subsequent work will be awarded based on mutually agreed upon and separately negotiated options for a full scale field demonstration ground modificat ion test program, cooperative development of a geotechnical baseline report, jet grouted cutoff wall installation, and all remaining ground modification and associated work. The primary purpose of the Geotechnical Baseline Report is to establish an agreed upon statement of the geotechnical conditions anticipated to be encountered during construction.  The government anticipates award of this contract by February 2005.  Award of the test program option, geotechnical baseline report option, and cutoff wall installation option are tentatively scheduled for the spring of 2005.  Award of the construction opt ion is tentatively scheduled for the fall of 2005, subject to authorization and appropriation of funds for the project by Congress.  The Government does not guarantee award within this period nor shall the Government be liable for any costs should award oc cur before or after this period or occur at all.  Estimated combined project cost range (preconstruction services, test program option, geotechnical baseline report option, cutoff wall installation option, and construction option) is estimated to be betwee n $150,000,000 and $200,000,000.  The contractor selected under this solicitation shall provide design review input, cost estimating, value engineering, scheduling, and general construction services.  The contractor shall be a member of the project develop ment team during design and construction phases, along with the Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District the selected Board of Consultants A-E Firm, and other government entities.  Extent of participation during design as well as cost will be considered wh en deciding to award the various options.   PROPOSAL SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS Proposals will be evaluated using a best value request proposal.  A request for proposal outlining specific requirements will be issued on or about October 15, 2004.   REGISTRATION FOR SOLICITATION This solicitation will be issued on CD.

UPDATE*****UPDATE*****UPDATE The response date has been updated from 7/15/2004 to 8/16/2004. UPDATE*****UDATE******UPDATE The work consists of the ability to furnish all materials and perform all labor  required to provide power supply for Compression Aero Research Laboratory  (CARL) in facilities 20018E and 08185.  Project scope is to construct  underground cable ducts and provide new medium voltage cables to connect the  CARL test apparatus being relocated in Facility 20018E to the base power system  at substation C.  This work is supporting lab equipment installation.  It is  recommended that only a qualified electrical contractor with experience in this  specific type of work perform this task. The project includes associated  architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and  miscellaneous work.  Special requirements/concerns:  This project involves installing new concrete  encased duct banks in existing streets, and installing a new 15kV circuit from  Substation C to Building 20018E.  It is important that the work be completed  within the performance period without interruption, and that no unscheduled  power outages occur.  Traditionally, most medium voltage work has been done by  utilities.  It is vastly different from performing low voltage (120 or 480V)  commercial work.  The safety rules and the codes involved are completely  different for medium voltage systems versus low voltage systems.  Faults on  medium voltage systems are much more destructive physically, and much more  likely to result in death in case of accidental contact, therefore the  different rules.  Safety is the primary concern, and this work requires a very  specialized contractor with the proper experience. The estimated price range is between 250,000 to 500,000.  Period of performance  is 240 calendar days. NAICS CODE:  238210.  The size standard $12M. This is a  restricted procurement in accordance with the HUB Zone Act of 1997 (13 CFR  126), 15 U.S.C. 631 note. In accordance with DFARS 252.204.7004, the contractor  must be registered in the CCR prior to award of solicitations issued after 31  May 1998. Tel: 1-888-CCR-2423.  FAX:  1-703-696-0213. Every solicitation issued  after 31 May 1998 must include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, “Required  Central Contractor Registration”.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to the following questions received by emails:

1.	Who is the incumbent?  What is the current contract number?

Answer: Advanced Performance Consulting Group, Inc (APCG).  Contract number DCA100-02-F-4024.

2.	This appears to be a follow on effort.  There are indications that the current contract was a base year and 2 option years.  Is there an option year 3 that is not being executed?  

Answer:  This is not a follow on contract.  There is no Option Year 3.

3.	The RFP speaks to several completed strategic tasks in FY04?  Were these individual task orders issued under this contract?  If yes, how many were issued in FY04?  Are they individually negotiated?

Answer:  These were not individual task orders.

4.	As this is a Firm Fixed Price contract what is the government’s projected Level of Effort?

Answer: Government cannot comment on level of effort at this point.

5.	How many contractor personnel are currently supporting the DISA financial management community?  
 
Answer: Government cannot disclose this info at this point. 

6.	Are tasks 1 through 4 substantially the same as the current effort under the current contract?  

Answer: This is  continuation of the similar efforts.

7.	Are there required labor categories we should include?   

Answer:  This is performance based contracting.  Contractor determines what labor categories the proposal should include.

8.	Task 1 refers to the existing CFE roadmap.  Is that document available?

Answer:  See attachments.

9.	Task 2 refers to the CFE Home Team Financial Manager Metrics Scorecard.  Is that document available?

Answer: See attachment (document is in DRAFT).

10.	Task 2 also refers to the CFE Balanced Scorecard MOEs.  Are these available for review?

Answer: See attachment.

11.	How much time will be allocated for a new contractor to educate themselves on the efforts completed as a result of the past three years of effort.

Answer: This is determined by contractor.

12.	How many workshops are anticipated to be required?

Answer:  No specific number - - will be up to the contractor to propose a number based on the work to be completed.

13.	How many visits to Regional and Field offices were required in the past?

Answer: One time outside the NCR.  We have numerous offices within the NCR and many visits have been made to these locations.

14.	Task 5 is defined but unfunded.   Since we are required to include this effort in our proposal,  is there a timeline for execution of this task should funding become available?

Answer: Execution of Task 5 shall begin, once funding becomes available, within FY05 for a 12 month period.

15.	Task 6 is undefined and unfunded.  Should this effort be addressed as part of our technical approach?  

Answer: No, the contractor cannot propose a cost at this time since the task is currently undefined. 

16.	Per SOO subtask 5.1.1, can you provide us with a list of CFE entities and highlight those entities that are  "new"?

Answer:  Go to the DISA Home page located at www.disa.mil
Once there click on “About DISA” -> Org Structure -> Chief Financial Executive

Please note the CFE has one new division, CFE8 located at Scott AFB, IL - - this division is not included on the CFE Home Page at this time - - currently updating.

Answer:  Go to the DISA Home page located at www.disa.mil
Once there click on “About DISA” -> Org Structure -> Chief Financial Executive

18.	Are Home Teams focused on different functional areas of expertise, e.g., budget formulation, budget execution, etc.?

Answer: No.

19.	Per SOO 5.2.1, are CFE Home Team FM metrics focused on how Home Teams provide their products, services and expertise to internal and external customers and stakeholders?

Answer: Yes.

20.	Per SOO 5.2.1, how can we obtain a copy of the existing CFE Home Teams?

Answer: The Home Teams represent various DISA organizations.

21.	Per SOO 5.2.2, are CFE balanced scorecard MOEs focused on performance-based budgeting types of measures? 

Answer: Yes.

22.	Based on the deliverables list and the title of the SOO, do we assume we provide cost estimates for first base year (FY05) only?

Answer: No.  Please provide cost estimates for base and each Option Year.

23.	Section 6.1.1 of the SOO states that “the contractor shall conduct a status meeting once a week or as requested by the COR/TM…” but the deliverables list in section 6.1.3 calls for biweekly status reports.  Are status reports to be combined into bi-weekly deliverables or are status reports to be provided for each meeting?

Answer:  Status reports/meetings are biweekly unless requested more frequently by the COR.

24.	Several of the deliverables in Section 6.1.3 are not quantified. This makes it difficult to predict costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. Would the government, therefore, consider offering this work under a Time and Materials pricing arrangement?

Answer: No.

25.	If Government determine, as a result of the successful bidder’s work to achieve program objectives outlined in paragraph 4 of the solicitation, that new or modified financial systems are required to achieve the desired improvements, would the successful bidder be conflicted out of potential follow-on work to develop/implement financial system improvements? 

Answer:  No, the successful bidder would not be conflicted out of potential follow-on work to implement financial system.  We will not be developing new accounting system as we will use COTS that has been approved by BMMP. 

26.	Can an interest party submit a response using the GSA IT Schedule contract or only responses from MOBIS contract holders being accepted?

Answer:   Government accepts responses under both contract vehicles. 

27.	Is there a page limit for proposal submittal?
 
Answer: The page limit shall be no more than 25 pages.

28.	Is it possible to meet with the DISA point of contact for this work?
 
Answer: Please email us and we will provide answers in writing.  No meetings.

29.	Is there a list of current DISA contractors available and if so, would you please direct me to the location of this list?
 
Answer:  Please check www.disa.mil for any public information on contracting opportunities and contractors.

Best Estimated Quantity = 18

 This amendment is issued to clarify the required quantity, to add several notes, to delete a clause, and to extend the solicitation closing date as follows:
 
1.  For clarification purposes, potential offerors should be aware that this effort contemplates the award of a three-year Requirements contract as defined under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.503.  As such, the solicitation states a realistic estimated total quantity (Best Estimated Quantity – BEQ) for the total three-year ordering period.  However, this estimate is not a representation to an offeror or contractor that the estimated quantity will be required or ordered.  As provided under FAR 16.503(a) (2), the solicitation also provides minimum and maximum order quantities that the Government may order under each individual order and a maximum contract quantity that it may order during the three-year ordering period.
 
 
2.  As a result of Provision 1 above, the BEQ, minimum order quantity, maximum order quantity, and maximum contract quantity are clarified as follows:
 
Best Estimated Quantity:  18 each
Maximum Order Quantity:  12 each
Minimum Order Quantity:  2 each
Maximum Contract Quantity:  27 each
 
The Minimum Contract Quantity, by definition of a Requirements contract, would be 0.
 
 
3.  The following Notes are hereby incorporated into the solicitation:
 
NOTE 1:  Offers as to price are to be made only for the Best Estimated Quantity (BEQ).  Offers for maximum order quantity, minimum order quantity, or maximum contract quantity are not to be made, and if made, will be disregarded.  Evaluation of award will be based on the proposed unit price for the BEQ and those provisions as set out in Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award, of Part IV – Representations and Instructions, of the solicitation.  Special attention is also directed to provisions of Section I, Contract Clauses, of Part II – Contract Clauses, hereof entitled “Ordering,” “Order Limitations,” and “Requirements.”
 
NOTE 2:  Any resultant contract shall be in effect from the effective date of the contract through a three-year period or until the maximum contract quantity is exhausted, whichever comes first, unless the provisions of the clause “Option to Extend Ordering Period and Increase Qty” under Section H, Special Contract Requirements, of Part I – The Schedule, are exercised.
 
NOTE 3:  Any delivery schedules bid or proposed as “After Receipt of Order (ARO)” will be converted to calendar dates (ARO months X 30 + 10 days/ARO weeks X 7 + 10 days/ARO days + 10 days = calendar date of delivery) at time of award.
 
NOTE 4:  Sections K, L, and M of Part IV – Representations and Instructions should be returned with any proposal. 
 
 
4.  The “Inspection/Acceptance Report” required under Item 0001 of Part I – The Schedule, Section B, Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs is hereby changed as follows to reflect the transition to Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) for delivery reporting.
 
	FROM:
 
	Inspection/Acceptance Report:  DD250 Required
 
	TO:
 
	Inspection/Acceptance Report:  WAWF (See DFARS 252.232-7003)
 
 
5.  As a result of Provision 4, Clause 9952.246-9000, Material Inspection and Receiving Report (OMB No. 0704-0248)(JALC), under Section E, Inspection and Acceptance, of Part I – The Schedule, is deleted in its entirety.
 
 
6.  As a result of Provisions 1 – 5, the solicitation closing date shown in Block 9 of Page 1 is revised as follows:
 
	FROM:	23 AUG 2004 4:00PM
 
	TO:	13 SEP 2004 4:00PM 
 
7.	Offerors submitting a proposal should return a copy of this amendment to acknowledge their understanding of the changes.

<DESC>This amendment modifies a sources sought synopsis (W911QX-RFI-04-0001) previously published on 29 Jul 04 and amended on  11 Aug 04.  The Army is looking to reduce/minimize the number of power source types and configurations. Concepts that combine fun ction within the current Army's standard battery configurations are desirable. Legacy equipment requires individual power sources that are usually sealed within a battery box. Power source changes to theses systems would also require consideration of the b attery box in a new design as the battery box would still be a part of the equipment configuration.   Additional specifications: Peak current requirements; the power ranges are based upon a 16V nominal system. The low power, receive mode is nominally 8W-12 W with peaks of 16W- 20W.  Duty cycles vary, but a 9 minute to 1 minute receive/transmit mode is typically used over 72 hours operation.  Battery weight/dimension requirements; the current soldier system power source is set not to exceed two, two pound bat teries (0.61 liters volume each) for 24 hours. Future looking for similar weight/size to last 72 hours.  Desired charger to handle minimum of three 150 - 160Wh batteries and charge all batteries in 2 hours or less.  Weight for a 250W system to be less than  10 kg, dimensions not specified, smallest profile desirable.

<CONTACT>Sandra Cover, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-357-8309, Fax 202-357-0016, Email sandra.cover@dhs.gov
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE & REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. No solicitation is available. This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.     

The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) of the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding passive coherent localization (PCL) techniques for detection of surface targets on water and land.  

Background  
HSARPA is looking for new and innovative technical approaches to detection and tracking using multi-static localization through the technique commonly referred to as passive coherent localization (PCL). The targets of interest are (a) small and large vessels in coastal waters, ports and waterways; and (b) vehicles and persons crossing border areas. In PCL, an ambient broadcast signal, such as FM radio, HDTV or cell phone, is used as the illuminator. Exploiting signal processing, a set of networked receivers covering the area of interest combine echoes from moving targets to form tracks. PCL has been developed primarily for detection of aircraft targets, including stealthy aircraft. HSARPA is interested in determining whether this technique can be extended to (a) the tracking of small and large vessels along coastal areas and in ports and waterways, and (b) the tracking of vehicles and people along open border regions. HSARPA will initially focus attention on the maritime application.

Operations Concept  
The envisioned system concept is an adjunct to the radars traditionally used for vessel tracking (e.g., X-Band), extending and filling in tracking capabilities along coasts and in ports and waterways. The transmitter would be one or more of the broadcast signals described above. Relatively inexpensive receivers would be distributed in a defined area, with antennas mounted on structures of opportunity. Processing and tracking would be done on a regional basis, perhaps at the future Coast Guard Sector Command Centers. There are significant technical and basic physics issues involved, including but not limited to: the adequacy of the broadcast signal for the proposed application, multi-static propagation in urban environments, ground and sea surface clutter, and low target velocities. 

Requirements
An envisioned system would be able to meet the following requirements. (1) Be capable of providing coverage over either a major port or harbor area (such as Miami, New York, Hampton Roads, or Puget Sound) or along extended coastlines (such as the Florida Keys, Gulf Coast, Long Island Sound). (2) Be capable of detecting a 25 foot boat (estimated to be -5 to 0 dBsm radar cross section) at 3 knots or a jet ski at 10 knots. (3) Be capable of distinguishing between surface targets and low flying fixed and rotary winged aircraft.  (4) Be capable of tracking a target with an accuracy of better than 100 meters. (5) Be capable of separating and distinguishing targets 50 meters apart. (6) Be capable of developing and maintaining a complete surface track picture in the area of concern. (7) Be capable of an update rate of less than 10 seconds and a latency of less than 5 seconds.

Possible Program
Dependent on the responses of this RFI, a follow on program may include the following phases: (a) one or more engineering tests and analysis to determine performance characteristics and limitations, (b) a proof-of-concept demonstration in a harbor or coastal area, and (c) a leave-behind operational prototype. However, the government has not decided upon such a program and this RFI does not constitute notice of intent to embark on such a development program.

In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI, including any subsequent requests for proposal (RFP). Only responders who have already developed or have PCL technology and demonstrated results are desired. All responses should address the following subjects:  (1) company experience in PCL technology development including programs, sponsors and development roles; (2) test results that are applicable to the technology; (3) company developed equipment and algorithms which are applicable; (4) the proposed concept including signals proposed, receiver characteristics, and signal processing techniques; (5) an analysis of the radar link equation for a harbor (New York) and coastal (Florida Keys) case; (6) a notional laydown (transmitter sites, receiver sites and coverage) for New York Harbor and the Florida Keys.  

Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.

All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to fifteen pages. Responses must be submitted via the web portal at hsarpabaa.com and in Microsoft Office format. Questions may be sent to hsarpa-PCL-RFI@dhs.gov. Contacts must be made by email only. All packages submitted electronically or by electronic media shall be free of any computer virus. If a virus is found, the package will be destroyed and a replacement will be requested, which must be provided within three days after notification. Response to this RFI must arrive in this office no later than 4:00 pm (EDST) on September 15, 2004.

These are follow-on devices to those presently installed at Naval Submarine Training Center-Pacific (NSTCP), Pearl Harbor, HI and Naval Submarine School (NSS), Groton, CT.    The government anticipates the issuance of a contract on a sole-source basis to Treadwell Corporation, Thomaston, CT for the satisfaction of this requirement.  The primary use of this trainer will be to teach operation, maintenance, and fault isolation skills normally associated with the tactical AEOG system.  Treadwell Corporation, possesses the technical data/drawings necessary to produce/manufacture the CTE.  The AEOG simulator configuration must be identical to those currently installed at NSTCP Pearl Harbor and NSS Groton.  The simulators will not be required to have gas production capabilities, however, the controls and indicators must respond accurately to operator inputs, as well as instructor-entered faults.  A non-functional cell area, comprised of sixteen cells will allow trainees to perform required maintenance procedures on the cells.  Pre-faulted modules will be used for maintenance training on the rectifier cubicle.  In order to achieve total trainer functionality, modifying the AEOG-CTE controller software is a requirement.   Rights to the controller software are possessed by Northrup Grumman, Sykesville, MD.  Any company believing they have the capability of satisfying this requirement as prime contractor is invited to provide a technical capability statement to the contract specialist, Alan Wright at alan.wright@navy.mil or fax at 407-380-4742.  The statement should include detailed information regarding arrangements made to secure the rights to the required technical data/drawings and software.  All responses will be considered.

<SUBJECT>A -- Clinical Trial Methods in Neurology
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NS-04-015

<ARCHDATE>09242004
<CONTACT>Ida Lirette, Program Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email il26v@nih.gov - Laurie Leonard, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email ll44s@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing a contract to develop a course of intensive training in clinical trial methodology for neurology research.   NINDS is attempting to identify sources with experience and expertise to develop and coordinate the scientific design and implementation of such training.  

Background

The proposed idea is for development and implementation of a short course in clinical trial methodology targeted to junior neurology/neurosurgery faculty and fellows.  Good design and conduct of clinical trials can provide definitive answers about the effectiveness of new therapeutic approaches.  This can lead to promising avenues of research that are based on sound basic scientific work and lead to the introduction of new treatments into the general practice of neurology and neurosurgery.  The field of neurology clinical trials is still fairly young and there is a need for more medically-trained researchers with appropriate methodological training.  Currently, training in clinical research methodology that is typically provided by undergraduate and post-graduate medical education programs and fellowships is not adequate for developing future leaders in neurology clinical trials.  The proposed course is intended to provide the essential basics that will help the trainees make the transition from an interesting research question to a well-planned research protocol.

Similar courses in other disciplines (e.g., oncology, cardiovascular disease) often incorporate lectures, panel discussions, and working sessions over an intensive training period of 1 to 2 weeks.  The course agenda for this program is intended to focus on general as well as neurology-specific concepts in clinical trials design and conduct and to provide students with hands-on experience in developing a clinical trials protocol.  Neurology and neurosurgical clinical fellows and junior faculty will be invited to apply to attend the course.  To be most effective, we expect the training course to be conducted at least annually.  Evaluation of course quality and impact will be a significant component of the proposed initiative, with the results to be incorporated into subsequent years’ programs and curricula.  We also want to stress the importance of methodology and training in minority populations and investigators.  

It is anticipated that this course will yield a group of talented, dedicated neurology researchers who will consequently be in a position to obtain funding for their own high quality clinical research.  If the program is successful, it is anticipated that trainees will return to their academic departments where they will take a prominent role in advancing local research priorities in neurology.     

Goals of the Contract

The purpose of such a “Clinical Trial Methods in Neurology” course is to increase the reliability and effectiveness of clinical trials by: introducing clinical fellows and junior faculty in any neurology or neurosurgical subspecialty to the principles of good clinical trial design; exposing early career clinical scientists to the full spectrum of challenges in clinical research; and developing a cadre of well-trained, experienced clinical researchers whose expertise will foster better clinical trials design and thereby hasten the introduction of improved regimens for therapy and prevention of neurological disorders into everyday medical practice and patient care.  

Specific goals of the contract are:

1.  To develop scientific content, curriculum, and format of the training program.
2.  To organize and conduct the training program, including recruitment and selection of faculty and participants.
3.  To conduct formal evaluation of the training program.

Information Requested

Information in the following areas will aid in the design of the proposed solicitation.  We ask that interested organizations identify critical criteria to be included in the solicitation.  The information supplied in response to this request need not be limited to these areas.

•	General scientific approach to identifying content and developing and implementing the training program; 
•	General scientific approach to on-going evaluation of the training program;
•	Overall estimation of the number of personnel required and specific expertise needed, with approximate level of effort required for each;
•	Availability of technology;
•	Project timeline;
•	Your organization’s capability as it relates to this project.

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government’s use of such information.

<SUBJECT>28 -- New Fuel Cell Membrane
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories has developed a new type of polymer electrode membrane (PEM) for application in the next generation of fuel cells.  The Sandia Polymer Electrolyte Alternative (SPEA) could bring to realization micro fuel cell configurations to power sensors, laptop computers, communications devices (e.g. cell phones), microelectronics, in healthcare applications and transportation, utilizing a diverse collection of fuels such as hydrogen, glucose and methanol.

The SPEA material is capable of operating at high temperatures (140 degrees Centigrade) to produce a peak power of 1.1 watts per square centimeter at 2 amps per square centimeter at 80 degrees Centigrade.  As such, the membrane material allows higher power outputs with methanol and hydrogen fuels than Nafion, a recognized state-of-the-art material used to fabricate PEMs for fuel cells. The SPEA membrane allows for low fuel crossover properties and increased power density relative to other membrane materials, as well as operation at low relative humidity conditions. The milestone for operation is to develop these SPEA materials for automotive applications which operate at 120degrees Centigrade for 2000 hours with low membrane interfacial resistance.  Material validation studies have been completed with the Sandia battery group as well as at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

As the SPEA material operates at higher temperatures relative to Nafion, several advantages are realized, including the possibility of smaller fuel cell stacks as a result of better heat rejection, enhanced water management, and significant resistance to carbon monoxide poisoning.

<SUBJECT>A--BAA Amendment
<DESC>The following language replaces the language of BAA 0402MT in full. DESCRIPTION.  This Broad Area Announcement (BAA), in combination with its supplemental attachments and web site, constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this notice be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Quantum Information Science (QIS) Program is open to all research and development organizations, whether located in the U.S. or not, including large and small businesses; academic and eligible non-profit and not-for-profit institutions; collaborative ventures from mixed sources; and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).  In the future, ARDA intends to release other BAAs through the Army Research Office, and possibly other agencies, addressing related topics.  ARDA reserves the right to unilaterally redirect white papers and proposals to such other BAAs as it deems appropriate.  Please refer to http://www.aro.army.mil and http://nbc.gov/qis.html for more information on related BAAs.    INTRODUCTION.  The Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition and Property Management Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, acting as the contracting agent for the Intelligence Community's Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA), is issuing this BAA to solicit research and research support proposals addressing innovative research in the field of quantum information science.  Quantum mechanics promises physically secure transmittal of information as well as tremendous speed-up of computation through non-classical operations.  This work package seeks to elucidate, control, and exploit quantum phenomena for revolutionary advancement of computation and secure communication.  In addition, it seeks to accelerate development of ancillary technology critical to common areas of research.   Multiple awards are possible with typical periods of performance of 12 to 24 months with the possibility of option years including final reports and/or demonstrations.  The program will have the ability to handle rapidly changing constraints and anticipates awards up to a total value of approximately $8 million over 2 years.  All awards will be subject to critical milestone reviews on an annual basis, at which time option and continuation decisions will be made. The information in this BAA announcement is supplemented by a Proposer's Information Pamphlet (PIP).  It provides further information on the eligibility, research areas, multidisciplinary approaches, preparation and submission of proposals and selection criteria.  The PIP is available on the Internet at http://nbc.gov/qisbaa.html.  The PIP may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, or ground mail by sending a request to the Department of the Interior, Fort Huachuca by electronic mail to Lawrence_H_Carter@nbc.gov or by calling 520.533.1213.   PROGRAM BACKGROUND.  ARDA seeks innovative research to support and advance its quantum information science objectives.  The Quantum Information Science Roadmaps are published at http://qist.lanl.gov/.  This includes the Quantum Communication Roadmap and the Quantum Computation Roadmap (version 2 now posted) providing background technical information and summarizing the main technology areas comprising the current programs.  The Roadmaps also discuss the overall status of each technology area and some of the major strengths and weaknesses.  In general, proposals must explicitly identify which of the milestone(s) of the Roadmap(s) are being addressed or have a compelling explanation for why they are not consistent with those milestones.    PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.  There are four (4) major areas of interest within the program: 1.  Quantum Computation.  The long-term objective of quantum computing is to provide new and radically different computational capabilities going beyond classical computers.  While quantum computing may ultimately entail the assembly and manipulation of large numbers of quantum bits (qubits), experimental demonstrations of quantum logic performed on several quantum bits operating simultaneously would currently represent a significant advance.  Demonstrations of quantum feedback or error correction for multiple quantum bit systems are also of interest.  In addition to physical implementations of quantum computing, there is strong interest in developing new quantum algorithms providing new methods for solving classically intractable problems or that greatly improve on existing classical algorithms (e.g., in speed or memory requirements).   2.  Quantum Communication.  The ability to transmit information through quantum channels and especially to exploit entanglement between spatially separated quantum entities has opened the possibility for a means of communication with security based on physical principles and laws, rather than mathematical algorithms.  The objective here is two-fold; advanced quantum cryptography systems, and communication of quantum information based on distributed entanglement such as in quantum teleportation.  Experimental demonstration of innovative entanglement-based quantum cryptography systems is of particular interest.  Of further interest is the demonstration of long-range quantum entanglement, entanglement transfer among different quantum systems and long-term quantum memory.    3.  Supporting Fundamental Studies.  One objective is to ascertain the limits of the ability to create, control, and utilize quantum information in multiple quantum entities in the presence of noise.  Experimental investigations of coherence properties, decoherence mechanisms, decoherence mitigation, entanglement, nondestructive measurement, complex quantum state manipulation, and quantum feedback are of interest.  Of particular interest is demonstration of coherent quantum state manipulation on time scales much faster than decoherence times.  Physical systems promising scalability to many quantum bits and quantum operations will receive the greatest attention.  Theoretical analyses of non-classical phenomena may also be of interest if the work is strongly coupled to a specific experimental investigation, as may proof-of-concept demonstrations in atomic, molecular, and optical systems or in solid-sate systems.  Only fundamental studies advancing the goals of objectives 1 and 2, above, will be considered for funding under this BAA. 4.  Supporting Ancillary Technology Efforts.  Certain experimental investigations discussed in objectives 1 through 2, above, may require special technologies or devices difficult to procure, or commercially unavailable.  For these cases, special efforts may be needed whose objective would be either to develop and demonstrate, or to design, procure, and possibly improve technology critical to any of ARDA's quantum information science programs.  A web site will be set up to provide details and expand on changing requirements.  (An example of what might be provided on the web site may help here:  ARDA's Quantum Communications programs have particular interest in robust high speed (perhaps >100 KHz or >100 MHz) single photon and entangled photon-pair sources at visible to communications wavelengths.  Similarly, single and number resolving photon detectors exhibiting high (>90% or >99%) quantum efficiency, high speed (>100 KHz or >100MHz) and relatively low dark count rates are of interest.  Additional examples of interest to the quantum efforts might include low loss (<0.1%) optical components and fibers, e.g., low loss blue and 1.5 micron friendly optics and fibers, optical UV switches (>40dB isolation), stable high speed (GHz) lasers, solid state 200-400nm sources, photon/quantum storage constructions, and demonstrations of plasmonic constructions for photon entanglement transport.) PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for proposal preparation costs.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or to any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  If a contract or subcontract(s) with a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) is proposed, offerors are reminded of the limitations in their use (see FAR 35.017) and must provide documentation in the proposal that work is not otherwise available from the private sector.  Each proposal shall reflect the potential for commercial application and the benefits expected to accrue from this commercialization.  Technology transition efforts, partners, or plans should be explicitly discussed.   Three Step Idea Submission Process Step 1--Initial Contact:  An informal initial contact paper is required in which the desired outcome and duration of the proposed research is succinctly stated, and which contains a single overall approximate budget figure (i.e. a "rough order of magnitude" budget) for the research.  The 1 page initial contact papers must be written in English and submitted as a letter sized page (8.5' x 11.5' sheet with margins no smaller that .75') in a single PDF or Microsoft Word formatted file with a font and pitch of Times New Roman 10. These are submitted to the following e-mail address:  Lawrence_H_Carter@nbc.gov.  The email subject line shall contain the following:  ARDA-QIS BAA 04-02-MT, Initial Contact Paper  Initial contact papers shall contain two sections, the first shall be a standard cover sheet, found at Attachment 1 of the PIP, which contains pertinent administrative information and the second section being a one page project summary described above.  Initial contact papers exceeding one page (not including the standard cover sheet) and/or not containing all the required information WILL NOT be considered.  ARDA uses this initial contact submission to minimize unnecessary paperwork on the part of the submitter and determine the interest for and value of the proposed effort to the applicable programs.  ARDA will generally respond to initial contact papers within one month of their receipt. Evaluation Factors for Initial Contact Papers 1.  Potential contribution of the research to quantum computing and quantum communication, fundamental studies or ancillary technologies missions as specified by the proposed objective/outcome, the linkage to specific efforts supported, and the linkage to the roadmaps found at http://qist.lanl.gov and  2.  The realism and reasonableness of cost and schedule. Step 2 - White Paper:  A more detailed white paper may be submitted ONLY if requested as a result of the submission and favorable evaluation of an initial contact paper.  White papers shall be no more than ten pages in length and outline the proposed project, give a summary of investigator qualifications, list meaningful proposed milestones and their relationship to the relevant Roadmap milestones, and contain a budget estimate.  They must be received within the time period specified in the response to the initial contact (commonly one month).  White papers must be transmitted to the email address given in the initial contact response, with the subject line as follows:  ARDA-QIS BAA 04-02-MT, White Paper.  White papers should follow the format described for the full proposal.  White papers must be written in English and submitted in a single PDF or Microsoft Word formatted file using letter sized pages (8.5" x 11.5" sheet with margins no smaller that .75" and with a font and pitch of Times New Roman 10, double-spaced.  Each white paper shall contain a single title page containing an executive summary, a single budget page outlining expected expenditures and justifications, and a single page containing curriculum vitae sketches.  This leaves a maximum of seven pages for the technical portion of the white paper, including all references and figures.  Not considered as part of the ten page maximum length is the required cover sheet found at Attachment 1 of the PIP. Proposers must specify in the title whether a white paper is to be considered a Quantum Computing, Quantum Communication, Fundamental Study, or Ancillary Technology white paper. Feedback on the white papers shall be e-mailed directly to the proposed Principal Investigators, generally within one month of receipt of the white paper.  It is possible ARDA will ask the invited proposal be submitted to an agency other than ARDA.  Such guidance will be provided in the feedback emailed to the Principal Investigators and will include a submission deadline, if necessary. Evaluation Factors for White Papers 1. Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research; and 2. Potential contribution of the research to quantum computing and quantum communication, fundamental studies or ancillary technologies missions as specified by the proposed objective/outcome, the proposal's annual milestones, the linkage to specific efforts supported, and the linkage to the Roadmaps found at http://qist.lanl.gov/; and 3. Experience and qualifications of the principal investigator, other key personnel, and the proven capability of the institution sponsoring the proposal; and 4. The realism and reasonableness of cost and schedule. Step 3-Proposal:   Each separate proposal must be the result of following the Contact Paper-White Paper chain detailed in this section or the result of ARDA redirecting proposals from other BAAs to this one.  Proposals may be submitted on or before the date specified in the response to the white paper or redirection from another BAA, to the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition and Property Management Services Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  Information or data contained in a full proposal deemed proprietary by the offeror should be clearly marked.   Proposals shall consist of two volumes: 1) Technical and Management and 2) Cost.

<SUBJECT>F--Fire Management Plan Templates, BLM, Colorado State Office
<DESC>The BLM, Colorado State Office proposes to award this project to Wildland Fire Associates under GSA contract number GS10F1059M non-competitively .  The project involves taking current BLM, Colorado Fire Management Plans which have been processed through the NEPA process and formatting  them into the Interagency Fire Management Plan template.  Due to the timeframes dictated by the NEPA processing requirements, and the fact that the Fire Management Plan templates are required to be in place by September 2004, the decision was made to award the project to Wildland Fire Associates because they were willing to take on the work with the extremely short performance period allowed.

<SUBJECT>D--Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>GovWorks on behalf of the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) intends on awarding a sole source contract to Virtual Research Associates, Inc (VRA).  CAA is acquiring services in the form of access to information provided by VRA for the project entitled "NEAR-TERM FORECITE Monitor".  In January 2003, CAA initiated a project called Near-term Forecasts of Crisis and Instability using Text-Based Events (FORECITE).  The purpose of the purpose of the study was to develop and demonstrate a capability to monitor and forecast indicators associated with instability in near-real time in nearly every country throughout the world.  In October 2003, VRA was awarded a contract to help design the system and to provide the unique, natural language parsing technology to populate the monitoring and forecasting models developed for the system.  The purpose of this purchase order will be to obtain VRA's services to provide near-real time data to populate the models throughout FY2005.  There is one other know provider of a similar type of technology out of the University of Kansas.  Access to the service is free, but use of the service would require CAA to staff a team of twelve full time analysts to generate and analyze the same data whereas access to VRA can provide the same information at a fraction of the price and manpower.  The use of VRA in a sole source contract is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Intended award date is September 1, 2004 and the total project length is estimated at 12 months. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any questions regarding this effort should be directed to Mr. Alan Rumney, Contracting Specialist by email at Alan.Rumney@mms.gov or by phone at 703-787-1329.

<SUBJECT>B -- Integrating Transportation Network Data Into Predicitive Models For Invasive Species Project
<DESC>PLEASE NOTE- THOSE WHO APPLIED UNDER DTOS59-04-Q-00064  NEED NOT RE-APPLY.  Contractor should submit a brief summary (not to exceed 3 pages) telling us how their company meet the following requirements.



BACKGROUND

The study seeks to enhance the predictive capacity and the transportation-decision utility of existing invasive species models through the addition of transportation system information.  These models have not typically included a transportation element to account for species spread, but the addition should be technically feasible and could enhance the model’s usefulness.

The current method of responding to invasive species in transportation relies on early detection and subsequent removal, but such a strategy is reactive and may allow time for the species to become established.  Modeling the potential distribution of a species based on characteristics of its ecological niche or other criteria is proactive and may improve our ability to prevent species invasions. 

PROJECT NAME: Integrating Transportation Network Data into Predictive Models for Invasive Species

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This study seeks to enhance the predictive capacity and the transportation-decision utility of existing invasive species models through the addition of transportation system information.  Such models include the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) or the Spatially Explicit Individual-Based Simulation (SEIBS) type models.  These models have not typically included a transportation element to account for species spread, but the addition should be technically feasible and could enhance the model’s usefulness.

The current method of responding to invasive species in transportation relies on early detection and subsequent removal, but such a strategy is reactive and may allow time for the species to become established.  Modeling the potential distribution of a species based on characteristics of its ecological niche or other criteria is proactive and may improve our ability to prevent species invasions. 

Deliverables:
•	An adapted model or methodology for including transportation information in invasive species modeling.
•	Written report suitable for publication by DOT, including annotated bibliography.
•	Two briefings for DOT officials, one at project onset and one upon completion.
	
Elements:
•	Technical feasibility, i.e. potential for this type of approach.  Should include discussion of which models, species, and decision makers would be most likely to benefit.  Should outline additional applications for this type of approach.
•	Modeling application.  The modeling aspect of final product could be in the form of a transportation network module for a specific modeling application, or a modeling application that will complement existing model output and existing DOT GIS capabilities and resources.
•	Proof of concept work that involves application of transportation system data to predictive models for a variety of plant and animal species.  This work should include a variety of modes - Maritime, Aviation, Highway, or Rail.  The project should also include potential actions to reduce the risk of species invasion based on the proof of concept work. 
•	Plan to share information regarding the application of this technique, in order to allow others to do similar analysis on additional species.

PROJECT LENGTH/TIMEFRAME: 8-12 Months

APPROACH: This statement of work will be published in the Commerce Business Daily.  Offerors who show interest in the project will receive an openly solicited Request for Proposal (RFP).  Final project selection will be based on the responses received under the RFP.

BACKGROUND: Cornell ecologists estimate that the total costs of invasive species in the United States amount to more than $100 billion each year, including damage “from alien weeds  (cost: $35.5 billion) and introduced insects ($20 billion) to human disease-causing organisms ($6.5 billion).”   Our transportation network plays a role in amplifying this damage by allowing the movement organisms into new areas, providing them the opportunity to greatly expand their range.  For example, the Asian long-horned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis, invasions likely originated from wooden packing materials used to ship goods from China,  and Brown Tree snakes, Boiga irregularis, in Guam is believed to have been introduced by military cargo planes and ships during World War II.  

Traditionally, work to prevent invasions begins well after a species has taken hold in a new area, necessitating expensive physical removal of the invading organism.  In some cases, species become so well established that removal is impossible.  This study seeks to move the Department’s efforts to address species invasions from being reactive to being proactive.  By predicting where species are most likely to invade, and then predicting what transportation routes would allow for such an invasion, transportation officials should be able to more effectively prevent new invasions through precisely targeted measures.  A proactive approach should lower costs and could potentially prevent costly invasions of undesirable species.

<SUBJECT>B--PLAN FOR PRIORITIZING TEACHER TRAINING, INTEGRATING EXISTING MATH, SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION INITIATIVES; AND EXPLORING OPTIONS FOR CREATING A "VIRTUAL" SPACE ACADEMY
<DESC>Request for Information on Commission Recommendation 8-1 The President’s Commission on Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy forwarded its report “A Journey to Inspire, Innovate and Discover” to the President on June 4, 2004. In that report, the Commission made a number of recommendations concerning the future missions and structure of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The report can be viewed electronically at  http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small.pdf	.  In recommendation 8 - 1, the Commission recommends that the federal government work with America’s education community and state and local political leaders to produce an action plan that leverages the Vision for Space Exploration in support of the nation’s commitment to improve math, science, and engineering education. To do so, that plan should:  -- increase the priority of teacher training;  -- provide for better integration of existing math, science, and engineering education initiatives across governments, industries, and professional organizations; and,  -- explore options to create a university-based “virtual space academy” for training the next generation technical work force.  The Commission wrote that the challenge before us is to leverage the journey to the space frontier to engage learners of all ages and interests. The commission said that NASA should enlist the cooperation of the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation to maximize the impact of space-related programs in education. Collectively these organizations, working with state and local political leaders, can establish a more aggressive approach for encouraging youth to enter math, science, and engineering professions, according to the Commission’s findings.  The Commission believes that expanded formal K-12 education efforts by industry, universities, and professional associations are needed, and that NASA should strive to integrate its educational efforts with those of these other interested stakeholders. In order for the vision to be as inclusive as possible, education programs need to target and recruit under-represented populations in the fields of math, science, and engineering.  In addition, the Commission cited the insufficient methods for students to acquire hands-on experience in the scientific and technical disciplines necessary for space commerce and exploration. They called for an alliance between NASA and universities to create a “virtual” space academy, the goals of which would be: 1) to provide tangible experiences that prepare students for a future in a space-related field, and 2) to bridge the divide between engineering and science training. The academy would be funded by NASA, but would take advantage of the programs and practices already in place in America’s universities.  NASA is very interested in receiving thoughtful comments and ideas from all sources regarding this recommendation of the Commission. Upon receiving these responses, NASA will share the information received with the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation.  NASA is also seeking ideas on establishing an institute for the study of space exploration policy. This institute would collect a number of interdisciplinary skills from science, engineering, public management and public policy, among others. This new entity would be a resource that could synergistically apply its various expertise to significant  space policy matters. Responses to this call for comments and ideas may lead to a decision to compete study contracts, feasibility studies or other follow-on work to implement this recommendation.  Questions concerning this RFI may be submitted via email no later than September 1, 2004, 5:00 PM EDT to chouston@mail.hq.nasa.gov. Responses to this RFI should be sent to Dr. Clifford Houston at the address shown below. Responses are due September 20, 2004. Respondents shall provide an electronic submission to the email address given above in addition to the hard copy submission to the address below. Responses are limited to 20 pages. An executive summary shall be included as a part of your 20 page response.  Responses may be sent to:  Dr. Clifford W. Houston  Deputy Associate Administrator for Education  Office of Education  NASA Headquarters  300 E Street S.W.  Washington, D.C. 20546  This document is for information and planning purposes. This document is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results.

<SUBJECT>R -- Performance-Based Contract for Technical Services for the Operation and Maintenance of the Marine Observation Network
<DESC>This is a Special Notice to announce the upcoming solicitation by the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) for the recompetition of the NDBC Technical Services Contract.  NDBC is located on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, at John C. Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis.  NDBC is comprised of a combination of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) civil service employees, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) personnel, and a service contractor.  Working as an integrated team, NDBC manages the development, operations, and maintenance of the Marine Observation Network (MON), in direct support of the Marine Observation Program (MOP).  This team serves as the NOAA focal point for data buoy and associated meteorological and environmental monitoring.  The MON is an integrated, sustained ocean observation and information delivery system that serves U.S. coastal waters, as well as the offshore waters of Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes.  The MON is a component of NOAA’s National backbone for marine observations.  The system consists of headland and moored buoy data acquisition platforms, real-time processing and information quality control, and product delivery systems.  The delivery system components include; moored buoys, coastal marine automated network (CMAN) sites, Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS), and oceanographic drifting buoys and subsurface oceanographic “floats.”  NDBC requires technical services to provide uninterrupted delivery of high quality, real-time environmental data to the operational elements of the NOAA and National Weather Service (NWS) for weather and ocean forecasts and warnings and for climate variability indications and assessments to a broader customer base.  The technical services contractor is expected to provide Engineering, Operational, Logistical, and Information Technology support to operate and maintain the MON.  This will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that has a $500,000,000 ceiling that includes a 5-year base contract and 5-award term years.  The minimum guarantee for this IDIQ is $250,000 over the life of the contract.  NDBC’s existing requirement is approximately $10,000,000 per year.  However, the Nation is concentrating on improving the quality and understanding of the global ocean and NOAA is interested in increasing and improving their present ocean observation capability.  Based on the national dialogue, NDBC predicts a three-to-five fold increase in its capability requirements in the next 10 years. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 561210 - Facility Support Services. The Small Business Size Standard is $30M. The acquisition will be unrestricted. All offerors classified as large business shall submit a subcontracting plan for utilization of small businesses. The subcontracting goals can be found at http://www.osec.doc.gov/osdbu/Accomplishments.htm. NDBC plans to release a draft solicitation on or about 08/31/04. Following the release of this draft solicitation, NDBC will host an Industry Day at Stennis Space Center, MS on 09/15/04. The Industry Day will provide valuable information about our mission, the terms and conditions of the upcoming solicitation, and a chance to meet the members of our team. Further, you will have an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback about the draft solicitation. In order to receive the draft solicitation and attend Industry Day, you must register with this website no later than close of business Wednesday, 09/01/04.

The procedure will consist of removing gaskets from all openings such as but not limited to bushings, pumps, radiators, manholes etc and replace with new ones equal to or better than that of the original quality.    The awarded contractor will follow except where specified otherwise, the applicable latest editions of NEMA TR 1 Standard, ANSI/IEEE C57 series and, as specifically applicable, ANSI/IEEE C57.12.00 "Standard General Requirements for Liquid Immersed Distribution, Power, and Regulating Transformers".         The Hot Oil Bath will have a closed-loop mobile system using connecting hoses between the de-energized transformer and the mobile unit.  The entire system including hoses will be filled with oil before the processing is initiated.  The oil will be removed from the bottom of transformer.  As it enters the processing equipment it will need to be cleaned and stripped of oil decay by-products, water and gases through multiple passes of heat, vacuum, fullers earth and micron filters.  The outgoing oil should rise beyond the aniline point (160* - 180*F).  The system should maintain this within a few degrees throughout the processing of the oil and the de-sludging of the transformer.  The oil will then be returned to the unit at the top, therefore an adequate amount of oil will remain in the transformer at all times. This hot oil will penetrate into the sludge saturated insulating paper, the cooling fins, cooling ducts and between the windings thus providing for a continuous dissolving action of the oil decay by-products.  The exact number of total pumping gallons required to clean our transformer is predicated on the levels of oxidation-by-products as noted in acid and interfacial tension oil test. This will be accomplished by running the full volume of oil through 10 complete passes of heat, vacuum and fullers earth with an additional 4 passes if necessary of heat and vacuum.          The awarded contractor must be able to guarantee the finished oil will meet the specifications detailed below.  Dielectric 34-kV, Acid number will no be greater than 0.03 mg/KOH/g and the Interfacial Tension shall not be less than 36 DYNES/Per Centimeter.  The secondary unintended consequence of removing the total combustibles in this unit to approximately 10% or the original combustionable content.         It must be further understood that simply removing the oil and replacing it with new oil will not protect our paper insulation.  This is due in large part to the propensity of the paper insulation to hold a minimum of ten percent of the total volume of the original contaminated oil.  The oil remaining in the paper will simply contaminate the new oil and cause it to climb to unacceptable levels faster than if you reclaimed the unit properly. This will also be the case in the event of improperly doing a Hot Oil Clean service with less than the recommended total pumping gallons and this is not acceptable.  In this scenario with less than recommended total pumping gallons of heat, vacuum and fullers? earth, the hot oil will act as a cleaning agent.  Unfortunately it will clean the outer twenty five percent of the paper insulation without deep cleaning the entire system.  This allows contaminates deep in the insulation to escape and re-contaminate the entire system at faster levels. The awarded contractor will have included in his proposal the cost for but not limited to the following items.  All men, material and equipment (not including crane) required to remove all old gaskets and install new ones and perform the Hot Oil Bath. The clean up and disposal of items such as needed make up oil, generated waste, waste oil and fullers earth from the job site.  The awarded contractor?s job site representatives and personnel will be responsible for adhering to Western Area Power Administration PSSM and PSOM documentation. The unit will be de-energized and removed from service by Western personnel a clearance will be issued to a Western representative.  Grounds will be installed by Western personnel and a Special Work Permit will be issued to the awarded contractor?s representative.  Upon completion of the job the contractor?s representative will release his Special Work Permit to Western representative.  The unit then will be tested by Western personnel to insure MED KU2A is ready to be restored to service.  After MED KU2A has been found ready to be restored to service Western personnel will remove the grounds and release their clearance and restore the unit to service.

<DESC>(i)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  Any amendments to this solicitation will be placed only in the FedBizOps.  (ii)  This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal.  (iii)  The solicitation document applies and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.  (iv)  The NAIC Code is 334220 and the Size Standard is 750 employees.  This is a fixed price type contract.  (v)  The following is a list of contract line item numbers (CLIN), quantities and units:  CLIN 0001 quantity of twenty-six (26) spread spectrum Global Positioning System (GPS) collars with partial cast, activity sensor, mortality sensor and remote release mechanism for tracking moose.  Offerors shall offer a fixed unit price and a fixed price for the total quantity.  Two deliveries shall be required to allow the Government to adjust collar size as needed.  (vi)  Required minimum specifications are as follow.  GPS:  Each collar shall be equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) capable of acquiring and storing ?11 GPS-based locations/day for ?900 days under conditions typical of high elevations in the northern Rocky Mountains.  Acquired data shall include date, time, latitude, longitude, and elevation, and shall be stored on board the GPS unit in non-volatile memory.  The Government shall be able to specify and/or program data collection interval for activity sensor.  Data collection interval shall initiate with each GPS fix attempt and record the number of seconds a switch closure is detected and accumulated during the specified data collection interval.  The actual number returned shall be a percentage of the total number of seconds in the entire collection interval.  GPS duty cycles and location acceptance criteria shall be fully programmable, and the data fully downloadable, under field conditions with a laptop computer and in a manner that does not compromise the durability (see below) of any component of the collar.  Location acceptance criteria shall allow the user to skew data collection to emphasize 3-D over 2-D fixes.  Data Transfer System:  Data transfer system shall be designed to recover GPS positional information and other data from the specified configurations of GPS systems deployed on moose.  Data shall be transferred via a frequency-hopping spread-spectrum (FHSS) bi-directional data modem.  Utilization of advanced spread spectrum technology makes the system more robust in the presence of noise sources and in hostile radio interference environments as compared to simple single channel FM data modem systems. Data transfer system:  Shall operate within the specifications set forth by the Federal Communications Commission in the unlicensed industrial-scientific-medical (ISM) band at 902-928 MHz.  It shall use a TCP/IP based protocol for data transfer with a data on-air bit rate of approximately 19200 bits per second, and an effective bit rate of approximately 5200 bits per second.  Transfer rate can slow to approximately 12-15 GPS positions/second when supplemental data used for post-processing differential correction are included.   It shall allow the option to transfer either uncorrected GPS data with or without the associated data for DGPS.  It shall incorporate an error correction detection scheme utilizing interleaving to maximize the benefit of error correction resulting in an approximate 5 to 8-miles line of sight range performance for the system from a functional animal born collar to a ¼ wave omni-directional antenna mounted on aircraft.   Data shall be downloadable on command from the collar-mounted unit anytime during preprogrammed receiving intervals.  Each transceiver shall have a unique IP address that allows a specific unit and download on an individual basis.  GPS location solutions shall be obtained on a preprogrammed basis and stored in collar-mounted units' memory.  Government shall be able to select the data to be downloaded based on the timeframe.  All data stored on the collar shall be downloadable or data collected during specific dates shall be capable of selection.  Supplemental data including activity measurements collected shall also be downloadable via data transfer system.  Operational parameters for transceiver shall be programmable by Government prior to deployment.  System shall provide status information via VHF beacon with user specified frequency (170-171 MHz).  Units shall contain mortality signals with special pulse rate indicating unit inactivity for a period exceeding 4 hours.  VHF power shall be independent of GPS unit and have an expected life of approximately 2.5 years operational life at 25° C.  The collar shall provide system health status, status of the previous GPS fix attempt and animal mortality.  Beacon shall be purposely inhibited when unit is fixing position or communicating across spread spectrum data link.  VHF beacon shall be a fully independent system operating on independent power supply such that failure of other systems shall not negatively impact the performance.  VHF beacon shall act as a backup system for unit recovery from the animal even if the other systems fail.  Government also requires additional specifications associated with the Spread Spectrum Transceiver:  FREQUENCY STABILITY of ± 2 PPM (-30C-70C); OPERATIONAL TEMPERATURE of -30 to +70 C; BIT RATE of 19.2Kbits/sec; TX POWER OUTPUT of 0.5W; RX SENSITIVITY of.5uV/12dB SINAD 20Khz deviation; IMAGE REJECTION of > 40dB; SURFACE ACOUSTICAL WAVE (SAW) FILTER; FREQUENCY RANGE of 902-928MHZ; SPREADING TECHNIQUE of FREQUENCY HOPPING, 50 CHANNELS, PN CODING; ERROR CORRECTION of PROPRIETARY CRC CODE WITH INTERLEAVING; COMMUNICATION RANGE of 5-8 MILES, LINE OF SIGHT; VOLTAGE of + 3.0 to 3.65 VDC; SLEEP CURRENT of 0.1uA; STANDBY CURRENT of 7uA; TX CURRENT of 600mA@3.0V;RX CURRENT of 60mA@3.3V; and RF OUTPUT IMPEDANCE of 50?.  VHF:  Collars shall be equipped with a VHF transmitter containing a mortality sensor (170-171 MHz) with estimated operational life ?30 months when transmitting at 60 beats/minute under conditions typical of high elevations in the northern Rocky Mountains.  VHF unit shall be programmed to transmit at different rates when on a living animal and last GPS fix was successful, when last GPS fix attempt was not successful and when animal has prolonged inactivity.  VHF power source shall be independent of GPS unit.  VHF unit shall operate on a unique frequency to be supplied by Government prior to construction.  Collar Release:  Collars shall be equipped with a programmable breakaway unit.  Government shall be able to communicate with breakaway unit via a programmable interface capable of changing release date and time.  The clock accuracy on board the unit shall provide breakaway time accuracy of +/- 15 minutes per year at 25° C typical and +/- 25 minutes per year worst case.  Weight:  Total weight including all components shall be ?2 kg.  Size:  Collar length will be specified by Government prior to construction.  Reliability:  All components shall be hermetically sealed against extreme inclement weather conditions.  Units shall not utilize user replaceable battery packs which employ o-ring or gasket seals but shall be contained within the hermetic package to ensure long-term reliability.  The transmitter's antenna housing shall be sealed in high-density polymer for shock protection.  All components shall be operational at temperatures of ?-40º C.  (vii)  All collars shall be delivered to the U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, Montana State University, 19 Forestry Sciences Lab, 1648 South 7th Avenue, P.O.

<DESC>The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR) provisions and clauses apply:  

52.212-1	Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (JAN 2004); 
52.212-2	Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999), award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance, The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution.
§	The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:
o	Factor 1 –Technical/Management Solution/Approach
o	Factor 2 – Performance Measures and Metrics
o	Factor 3 – Past Performance
o	Factor 4 – Cost/Price

Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

Cost/price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical factors approach equal.

DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical Management/Solution/Approach

The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractor’s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Hydraulic components (repair).  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:

(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

§	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.
§	Clear lines of communication between the Contractor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.
§	Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.

(d)	The Contractor’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance (i.e., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications).

Factor 2:  Performance Measures and Metrics

The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:

(a)	Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,
(b)	Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,
(c)	Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.

Factor 3:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractor’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor’s actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.

Factor 4:  Cost/Price

Each Contractor’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation of proposed price/cost

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.
(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor’s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor’s technical proposal.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair nd timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Question 2: SOW paragraph 6.1.5.  The field of view, both WFOV and NFOV are stated in inches, but without reference to distance.  It is not possible to compute the actual FOV being specified without more information.  Can you please clarify the FOV in degrees?
Answer 2: The requirements stated in Paragraph 6.1.5 of the SOW are hereby revised to read as follows:
	"1)	Wide Field of View (WFOV), 11 degrees (h) x 9 degrees (v)
	 2)	Near Field of View (NFOV), 3.7 degrees x 2.9 degrees"
Question 3: SOW paragraph 7.1.3.  This paragraph specifies detector material, InSb (Indium Antimonide), which seems to be in error.  InSb is normally used in cooled applications in the 3-5 micron spectrum, not uncooled LWIR.  Should we ignore the InSb reference?
Answer 3:The requirement stated in Paragraph 7.1.3 is hereby revised to delete the reference to InSb.
Question 4: SOW paragraph 8.0.  Subparagraph 8.1.4, the Recording Units, is the only subparagraph which refers to power supply requirements (6-16 VDC), yet other elements of 8.0, namely 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, also require power.  Can you please clarify the power requirements?  Also, throughout the SOW, the detector paragraphs generally refer to VAC requirements in addition to the VDC.  We believe this may have been overlooked in 8.0 overall, and would appreciate clarification.
Answer 4: The Government requests that everything have the option of being powered by either V DC or V AC at the Government operators discretion.
Question 5: In general, it appears that the Navy is seeking battery operation for every element of the SIAS; but it is not clear that VAC is required in all cases.  Could you please clarify?
Answer 5: See Answer 4, above.
