<DESC><strong>**FA8681-11-R-0089 IS THE NEW SOLICITATION FOR JPF COMPETITIVE FOLLOW-ON LOTS 8-14. IT REPLACES SOLICITATION FA8681-11-R-0037, WHICH HAS BEEN DELETED.**</strong>
<p><br />The purpose of this posting is to publish a pre-solicitation notice and the Draft Request For Proposal (RFP) in order to provide interested parties with additional information regarding this procurement. The Draft RFP will be released incrementally as this document becomes available. Potential Offerors are encouraged to review FedBizOpps for updates. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this notice and provide feedback. Any forthcoming formal RFP will be posted to FedBizOpps without an additional pre-solicitation notice. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. <br /><br />The AAC/ EBDZ/ EBDK, Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) Program, will be conducting a competitive source selection in FY11 for the JPF Follow-on Production program. The current JPF system includes the fuze, cable, fuze bomb initiator and a retaining ring. The contract will include seven (7) JPF Follow-on Production lots (Lots 8-14) for U.S. Government and FMS, technical support, non-warranty repairs, trainers, spares, instrumented fuzes, and sled test support. The Air Force acquisition strategy for the follow-on production contract is to begin deliveries no later than 24 months after contract award. <br /><br />The JPF is a multifunction, multi-delay tail fuze system with hardened target capability for use in general purpose and penetrating unitary warheads. The JPF operates with a wide variety of guidance kits, high and low drag fins, and with all configurations of the DSU-33 proximity sensor (which provides an airburst capability). When used with the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), the JPF operating mode and other settings may be selected in flight from the cockpit through a serial TIA-422 interface between the weapon and fuze. The objective of the JPF Follow-on Production program is to procure a JPF that, as a minimum, meets all the requirements of the Systems Requirements Document and is fully integrated and qualified for employment. <br /><br />Potential Offerors would be required to provide a fully qualified JPF that has documentation verifying that each requirement of the SRD has been met including compatibility with the MK-80 series (MK-82, MK-83, MK-84, including the BLU-110, BLU-111, BLU-121, and BLU-126) and penetrator warheads (BLU-109, BLU-113, BLU-122). The proposed fuze system must also be compatible for use in all JDAM variants, GBU 10/12/15/16/24/27/28 weapon systems, as well as the basic "dumb" bomb configurations and the AGM-130. In addition to weapons compatibility, the JPF must be qualified and certified on the following aircraft: B-1B, B-2A, B-52H, F-15E, F-16C/D, F-22, A-10, and MQ-9A. The Government funding profile for this acquisition is production funding, with no development funds available. This procurement does not include any technology development. The Offeror must propose a Systems Performance Specification that meets or exceeds the requirements of the Systems Requirements Document. At a minimum, the Offeror must have the capability to produce at a rate of 1,800 systems per month for the duration of the contract period, although actual Lot quantities are likely to be less. The offeror must also provide shipping to CONUS locations and also provide adequate production, test, logistics support, shipping and containers. All JPF components will be subject to lot acceptance testing.</p>
<p>We anticipate this procurement will be limited to Qualified U.S. Contractors. Prime contractors would then be allowed to request export license for participation of foreign companies as subcontractors. This program contains classified elements and export control data that will not be released on FedBizOpps. Potential prime contractor sources are requested to provide a statement of intent to submit a proposal as a prime contractor in response to the Formal RFP. The JPF Program Office has a technical data package that will be provided (for informational purposes only) electronically upon request from potential prime contractors that meet the conditions to be considered a "Qualified U.S. Contractor" IAW DoD Directive 5230.25. Potential prime contractors expressing their written intent to submit a proposal for this effort will also be given the opportunity to have a one-on-one session with the program office at the upcoming Industry Day event currently scheduled for 16 November 2010. One-on-one sessions will be continued on 17 November 2010 in the event that this additional date is necessary. One-on-one sessions will be scheduled on a first- come, first-served basis upon request to the Contracting Officer. Requests must be received NLT 10 November 2010 to be considered for a one-on-one session. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>In response to the Draft RFP issued, the AAC/EBDK/EBDZ program will accept comments submitted to the Contracting Officer, Leanne T. Green, at Leanne.green@eglin.af.mil. The subject line should clearly read: "Response to Draft RFP FA8681-11-R-0089." Potential Offerors should submit all comments as a single request no later than 29 November 2010. The Program Office intends to provide responses to non-proprietary questions/comments via FedBizOpps. Any proprietary questions/comments should be clearly marked. <br /><br />This Draft RFP does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future, and thus does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this Draft RFP. All costs associated with responding to this Draft RFP will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this Draft RFP does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the Draft RFP respondent to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of Offerors or potential Offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The primary Ombudsman is Col David A. Harris, AAC/CV and the alternate Ombudsman is Col Edward J. McAllister III, AAC/CS both located at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495, phone number (850) 882-5422, DSN 872-5422.</p>
<p>Participation is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government. Potential prime contractors should submit their statement of intent to submit a proposal as a Prime to the address below. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size in accordance with the size standard for NAICS code 332995; ensure that the company name, address, a point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number, Federal CAGE Code, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number in the capability package. No Collect Calls will be accepted. Responses should be sent to AAC/EBDK, (Leanne T. Green), 205 West D. Ave., Suite 545, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6848. Questions should be directed to Ms. Leanne T. Green at 850-883-0902, email Leanne.green@eglin.af.mil, or Ms. Danielle Steinke at 850-883-3541, email Danielle.steinke@eglin.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Performance-based Work Statement (PWS) is to perform emergency repairs to three T-10 Hush Houses at Hill AFB. Currently, several components of the Hush Houses are<br />inoperable or do not function as originally designed. Inoperable components within the Hush House are a definite operational concern, since the Hush House cannot be properly and safely<br />used without fully functioning components. The benefit of repairing the Hush House and components is to maintain operational testing capability for both installed and uninstalled aircraft<br />engines, as well as safety of the personnel within the Hush House. Maintaining operational capability directly impacts the mission capable rate for the aircraft, and increases aircraft uptime.<br />This effort will be considered a success if the Hush House are repaired in accordance with the provided requirements for the T-10 Hush House.

This proposed action is to obtain all efforts to include technical support, planning, managerial efforts, materials, labor, as well as equipment and facilities necessary to remanufacture and convert up to twelve aircraft from the H-60A to H-60L configuration.  It is anticipated that a new 60 month Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded for this remanufacturing and conversion effort.  Estimated quantity of aircraft that will be inducted into the program during the ordering period is twelve aircraft (It is estimated that the break-out will be five Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and seven OGA aircraft).  Individual requirements will be established through the issuance of task orders.  This contract arrangement will enable the Government to award requirements more efficiently by reducing procurement administrative lead-time in the acquisition process.  The contract will contain firm fixed prices for standard conversion efforts as well as firm fixed prices for installation of mission equipment kits, material, and labor rates for effort associated with the Pre-Shop Analysis and any repair and replacement effort that may be required to fulfill unique customer requirements.  The contract will also contain Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 252.217-7028, Over and Above (O&A) work, and establish provisions for obtaining O&A authorization for labor and materials not covered by the line item(s) in the basic contract that are necessary in order to satisfactorily complete the contract.  <BR><BR>This requirement is restricted to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC), 6900 Main Street, Stratford, CT 06615-9129, CAGE Code 78286.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis the continuation of a contract with the University of Utah for the "Identification and Characterization of novel Therapeutics for the Treatment and Prevention of Epilepsy and Neuroprotectants as Counter Measures (CM) to Chemical Threats." <br />The primary continuing goals of the contract are to evaluate novel compounds as potential: anticonvulsants, neuroprotectants, treatments for neuropathic pain and as therapies to combat exposure to chemical nerve agents. The Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP) conducts extensive testing to facilitate drug discovery and translational activities aimed at identifying, optimizing and translating such discoveries into therapeutics for affected patients. Active compounds are identified and tested through a series of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic evaluations (both in vivo and in vitro tests) that help define anticonvulsant or related disease profiles of candidate compounds. Test parameters include but are not limited to:<br />Baseline assessments of anti-seizure activity, neurotoxicity, effects on hepatic microsomal metabolizing enzymes, pharmacodynamic interactions, brain slice survival rates and chronic EEG monitoring. These efforts have been carried out under the contract mechanism since 1975 with the University of Utah. Approximately 700 compounds are evaluated annually for anticonvulsant and related activities. Overall testing requirements include the following: 1) Anticonvulsant Identification: evaluation of anticonvulsant activity and associated neurotoxicity in mice, following intraperitoneal administration using the 6 Hz induced focal seizures; 2) Compounds displaying significant activity may be further evaluated with subsequent quantitation using the supramaximal electroshock seizure pattern test (MES), the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol (sc Met) threshold test and the rotorod test. Those compounds possessing significant anticonvulsant activity in mice may also be evaluated in rats using similar models but via different routes of administration. Both activity and toxicity shall be quantitated at previously determined time of peak effects; 3) Pharmacologic Differentiation - Anticonvulsant profiles are developed wherein the efficacy will be compared with that of the prototype drugs. As part of this process, the efficacy is quantitated using seizures induced by bicuculline and picrotoxin. 4) Anticonvulsant profiles of candidate anticonvulsant compounds are also developed in rats by the rapid hippocampal-kindling model of complex partial seizures or the corneal kindled mouse model. Candidate substances are evaluated for their ability to block the expression of kindled seizures in either the rapid hippocampal kindling or the corneal kindled mode. A number of active candidates shall be tested and quantitated for their ability to block the acquisition of kindled seizures induced by rapid hippocampal stimulation. 5) Profiles for selected test substances will include a genetically susceptible model of reflex epilepsy; 6) Proconvulsant Potential - The endpoint being length of time taken for evidence of seizure activity following the infusion of pentylenetetrazol into the tail vein of mice; 7) Drug Interaction Studies - The metabolic potential for drug-drug interactions are determined using human liver microsomes. The potential to inhibit a battery of the major P-450 human liver isozymes are determined along with comparative assessment of the standard available anticonvulsants; 8) Metabolic gene induction studies; 9) Lamotrigine Resistant Kindled Rat Test - Animals will be kindled according to the procedure described by Postma et al. (2000) with seizures scored according to a Racine Scale (Racine, 1972). Seizure scores and afterdischarge durations will be recorded for each animal; 10) AED Modulation of Axonal Neurotransmission - this will be assessed via at least two tests: Partial Ligation of the Sciatic Nerve and the Formalin Test which are used to determine efficacy of an investigational AED against the acute and chronic hyper-responsive neuronal discharges following activation of peripheral nerve fibers. Other models of pain used are the Chung, tail flick and the carragheenan. 11) Slice electrophysiology studies and 24 hour EEG recordings are performed on a select number of candidates. 12) Morris Water Maze as a study of learning and memory along with the forced swim test; 13) Pilocarpine induced SE prevention model. Compounds will be assessed for pharmacological evaluation of potential activity to halt pilocarpine-induced convulsive status epilepticus (SE); 14) Benzodiazepine-resistant status epilepticus: Nerve-agent exposure causes convulsive status epilepticus (SE) that becomes resistant to benzodiazepine therapy over time, it is the goal of the NINDS to find therapeutic agents that block pilocarpine-induced electrographically monitored seizures at times when benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam) no longer block electrographic SE. 15) Finally, comprehensive summary reports are required for the best candidates (approximately 12 per yr.) that provide methods, detailed results, comparative assessments, discussions and conclusions.<br />During the last 35 years, the University of Utah has been able to successfully adopt specialized techniques, methods of evaluation, model development and accumulation of extensive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles for all the current therapeutic agents and most new investigational drugs. This accumulation of data and experiences is the basis by which all new test compounds are pharmacologically compared. The NINDS believes that the University of Utah is the only known source to collectively perform these comprehensive evaluations by virtue of their experience, demonstrated expertise, availability of required staff, laboratory and animal facilities and requisite trained personnel and resources. The NINDS rigorous requirements for consistency, compatibility and validation of data derived from these screening procedures is paramount to the success of this program.<br />Inability to produce compatible evaluation results to our existing data base would lead to delays in screening new compounds and incurrence of duplicate costs, both of which would be unacceptable to the Government and would disrupt the continuity of this work. Organizations that believe they have the qualifications and capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of staffing, facilities, and methodologies currently in place to the Contracting Officer at the above address within 45 days from the date of this announcement. An organization must have an ongoing program, available staff possessing substantial experience in conducting the required tests. They must also have the equipment, space and infrastructure in place to carry out the work described above. <br />All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, quotation or capability statement which shall be considered by the NINDS. The determination by the Government not to compete the new contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Authority: 45 U.S.C. 253&copy;(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This is not a formal solicitation or an announcement that a Request for Proposals (RFP) is available.<br />

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) proposes to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. HHS-NIH-NIMH-10-024 entitled <strong>"Rapidly-Acting Treatments for Treatment-Resistant Depression (RAPID)"</strong> under Full and Open Competition.<br /><br />This is a Research and Development initiative which is anticipated to leverage the development of rapid treatments (demonstrable clinical improvement within 72 hours of administration) for severe, treatment-resistant depression.<br /><br />1. The primary objectives of resultant contract(s) are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. To establish a network of sites to study "Rapidly-Acting Treatments for Depression" (i.e. the "RAPID-network") that will focus on identifying and testing promising interventions (pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological) that produce a substantial anti-depressant effect within 72 hours of initial administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. To perform randomized clinical trials testing such promising interventions (other than Ketamine Hydrochloride or sleep deprivation (total or partial)) in a well-characterizedcohort of adult patients (age 18-60) diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression.<br /><br />2. A secondary objective of resultant contract(s) would be:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. To further study and evaluate interventions that showed efficacy in a RAPID-network Proof of Concept trial in a larger clinical trial.<br /><br />Important Considerations:<br /><br />1. The Contractor(s) are responsible for identifying, recommending, and accessing (if a 3rd party is involved) all interventions to be tested during the contract period.<br /><br />2. In order to be competitive for an award, Offerors should propose, with the initial offer, a trial of promising intervention with a detailed protocol that the network would be capable of initiating without delay after the infrastructure is established and after gaining all regulatory approvals. <br /><br />3. The Contractor(s) should either already have access to and permission to develop the intervention (from a 3rd party supplier, if applicable), or provide evidence that there would not be delay involved in conducting the 1st trial due to access problems.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; The peer reviewed evaluation of the scientific merit of the 1st recommended intervention, and access to develop that intervention, will be an important factor in determining which Offerors may be awarded a contract. <br /><br />The Offeror should also have the capability to:<br /><br />1. Perform clinical trials of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in treatment-resistant depression specifically.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Provide scientific oversight, facilitate collaboration among the investigators, integrate complex protocol management, data acquisition, bio-statistical data analysis and reporting of results from clinical trials involving subjects with treatment-resistant depression.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Collaborate with multiple experts and stakeholders (investigators, clinicians, advocates, and consumers) in treatment-resistant depression research. <br /><br />General Information:<br /><br />This is a&nbsp;Pre-solicitation Notice in advance of the Request for Proposals (RFP), and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.&nbsp; The RFP, HHS-NIH-NIMH-10-024, detailing the specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an Offeror's proposal will be available electronically <strong>on or about</strong> <strong>November 24, 2010</strong> and may be accessed through the Internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website at: <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov">http://www.fedbizopps.gov</a>.&nbsp; No paper copies will be available.&nbsp; Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments that may be issued by the Government.&nbsp; Proposals will be due <strong>on or about January 12, 2011.</strong>&nbsp; It is anticipated that one or more cost-reimbursement contract awards will be made for a period of five years beginning on or about June 30, 2011.&nbsp; Contract(s) will be Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) and the number of interventions to be tested over the contract period is indefinite beyond the 1st intervention.&nbsp; <br /><br />This Pre-solicitation notice corresponds to the Small Business Sources Sought notice: #HHS-NIMH-SBSS-10-001 previously posted on August 11, 2010 and Research and Development Sources Sought notice#: HHSNIHNIMHRDSS10024 posted on September 16, 2010. <br /><br />All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be considered by the NIMH.&nbsp; This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.<br /><br />Please contact Marla Jacobson, Contract Specialist at <a href="mailto:jacobsonmj@mail.nih.gov">jacobsonmj@mail.nih.gov</a> for further information.</p>

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Technical Manufacturing Corporation (TMC), 15 Centennial Drive, Peabody, MA  01960 for a Clean Top Optical Table with STACIS iX 2-tier Active Vibration Isolation System.  

The NINDS Division of Molecular Neurophysiology will use the Clean Top Optical Table with STACIS ix 2-tier Active Vibration to conduct experiments which will address a series of questions about the Na/K and SERCA pumps. Mechanical stablility is paramount in
physiological experiments, and the apparatus is mounding on a large vibration table.  The intrinsic vibration characteristics of Building 35 at NIH introduce significant difficulties with regard to achieving a vibration free environment required for the required experiments.  This table developed by TMC, combines active and passive mechanisms to produce a table that can eliminate larger amplitude vibrations. This table is needed so that sensitive laser and electrophysiological equipment can be put on this table because there can be no vibration during sensitive photon experiments.

The following characteristics apply to the required items: 

(1) One (1) Optical Table (TMC Model No. 784-436-02R), 3 x 5 x 8 thick, CleanTop, individually sealed holes, Flatness + .005, 3/16 thick ferromagnetic stainless steel top plate with matte finish, -20 tapped holes @ 1 o.c. array, plated steel honeycomb core with .49 cell size, maximum damping, research grade;

(2) One (1) STACIS iX Laser Table Base Active Vibration Isolation System (TMC Model No. 25-ix-4x6x12) with Patented piezo-electric vibration isolation, digital controller, LCD user interface, with 2nd tier of passive isolation for optimized performance at 0.6-250 Hz, 4-8 dB isolation at 1 Hz, 10-20 dB isolation at 2 Hz, 25-40 dB isolation @ 4-100 Hz.

The Clean Top Optical Table and its accompanying STACIS Vibration Isolation system is a patented product sold and manufactured worldwide solely by TMC.  The STACIS iX Laser table incorporates patented Maxdamp passive and active isolators with patented STACIS technology and piezoelectric extended actuators.  This combination provides the most advanced vibration isolation system for extreme environments.  These environments are found in bldg 35 and this isolation is needed for laser imaging.  The STACIS system is the only commercially available vibration isolation system utilizing piezoelectric transducers to directly attenuate floor vibration resulting in a one of a kind actively controlled design.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 1859122 may be submitted to the NIDA Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions Brach, 31 Center Drive, Bldg. 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-2080 to the Attention of Korriise LaRoche, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD. <br />
<p><br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for architectural and engineering services and anticipates awarding two Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts as a result of this synopsis. It is anticipated that the maximum quantity required for each contract will be $500,000. The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term will be satisfied by the award of the first task order. There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year. This procurement is being processed in accordance with DFARS 219.10, Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and is therefore being issued using full and open competitive procedures with preference given to eligible Section 8(a) firms. If no Section 8(a) firms meet the minimum requirements set forth herein, award will be made to the highest qualified firms regardless of their small business status. The small business size standard is $4,500,000.<br /><br />PROJECT INFORMATION: The contractor will be required to provide multi-disciplined design work with an emphasis on the mechanical and electrical engineering disciplines. Design skills must be demonstrated for the following building types: office buildings, industrial warehouses, and general laboratory space. Typical architectural and engineering support may include the following types of efforts: (a) renovation and replacement of HVAC systems, re-design of water systems (internal to the building), installation and extension of sprinkler systems, installation of restrooms, and installation and retrofitting of elevators in existing buildings; (b) modification of electrical systems and upgrading existing building power distribution systems; (c) studies relating to code research, space planning, cost analysis, structural analysis and architectural evaluation; (d) architectural and structural support services, which may include additions and/or significant renovation of existing spaces or buildings; (e) demolition of buildings including removal of hazardous materials and assessment of environment concerns. Asbestos and lead are known to be present; therefore the A&amp;E firm shall identify and provide a design which will accommodate the disposal of these materials in the construction plans and specifications in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The first order to be placed under one of the two prospective contracts will be for a design to update the fire protection and sprinkler systems in a complex of five buildings with a combined area of approximately 40,000 square feet. And, as previously stated hazardous materials may be present, thus the effort should be treated as such. The first delivery order under the second contract will be to provide an analysis and design of the exhaust systems in two laboratory buildings that have had a change in their utilization of these systems since the buildings were commissioned at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC. Remediation of hazards will be required.</p>
<p><br />SELECTION CRITERIA: Firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated in accordance with the following evaluation criteria which are listed below in descending order of importance:<br /><br />(1) Specialized Experience: Firms shall demonstrate specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, with significant emphasis on Architectural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical disciplines, and Elevators. This proof of specialized experience and technical competence must include, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. The A&amp;E firm must indicate past experience by citing examples of the work required. Responding A/E firms must address both of the potential projects.<br /><br />(2) Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence of the Individual Design Team Members: Firms shall demonstrate the professional qualifications of personnel and proposed subcontractors for the project. Examples must be provided for similar projects performed by the proposed team and the duties performed by each of the team members. If the proposed team has not worked together before, the firm must provide experience of the individuals with their proven ability to work in a diverse team environment. <br /><br />(3) Capacity to accomplish work in the required time and capacity to accomplish multiple task orders simultaneously: Firms must also provide convincing evidence of the firm's, as well as, the entire team's capacity to accomplish the work within the required time limits (usually nine weeks for the average projects plus Government review time). It is very important to demonstrate the firms' ability juggle workload and to manage a number of projects at one time, such as would be required in an IDIQ type contract environment. <br /><br />(4) Past Performance: Firms will be evaluated on past performance information on contracts with Government agencies and private industry, which demonstrates cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Demonstrating this should include, at minimum, things such as letters of commendation/appreciation, a list of contracts, preferably IDIQ type contracts with multiple orders, the points of contact and phone numbers for references. Preference will also be given to those firms with appropriate superior performance evaluations on recently completed Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. Performance evaluations obtained from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) may be reviewed to assess a contractor's performance record, for the purposes of determining responsibility as required by FAR 9.1.<br /><br />(5) Firms Location: Firms will also be evaluated on their location, which typically should be in the general geographic area of the project, provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project. Contractors must be sure to include the location of each of the proposed subcontractors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(6) Volume of Work Department of Defense: Firms will be evaluated on the volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (for the last twelve months). In considering equitable distribution of work among A-E firms, include small business concerns, historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions; firms that have not had prior DoD contracts; and small disadvantaged business concerns and joint ventures with small disadvantaged business participants if the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsector of the acquisition is one in which use of a price evaluation adjustment is currently authorized (see FAR 19.201(b)).<br /><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: All contractors are advised that registration in the DoD Central Contractor Registration(CCR) Database is required prior to award of a contract. Failure to register in the DoD CCR Database may render your firm ineligible for award. For more information check the DoD CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a requirement for an Architect-Engineer Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Multi-Discipline Design and Construction Support Services, primarily for Fort Lewis, Washington and its Sub-Installations as well as McChord Air Force Base, Washington. This procurement will be evaluated using Brooks Act (PL-92-582) procedures and FAR Part 36. THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED ACQUISITION OPEN TO ALL QUALIFIED BUSINESS CONCERNS. The scope and purpose of this IDIQ contract will be to provide full multi-discipline and abbreviated design services for renovation, repair and minor construction projects, as well as to provide construction management services, primarily for projects at Fort Lewis and its sub-installations as well as McChord Air Force Base. Individual Task Orders to be assigned under this contract will identify specific requirements.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: (A) The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall perform all or part of the following design services, as identified in individual Task Orders: 1. Prosecute the various work features as described hereinafter to the extent set forth in individual Task Orders to be issued hereunder. 2. Utilize Government designs, drawings, specifications, and standards for buildings, structures and other facilities as necessary to meet the requirements of the proposed project. 3. Prepare, subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer, charrettes, preliminary studies, sketches, layout plans, reports and cost estimates of the proposed project. The variety of projects shall include maintenance, repair, alteration and minor construction projects at Fort Lewis and its sub-installations, McChord AFB and projects assigned to Seattle District, USACE. The number of copies of the studies, sketches, plans and reports to be furnished to the Government will be set forth in each individual Task Order. A portion of the designs shall be abbreviated plans and specifications with detailed cost estimates utilizing the Army Job Order Contract (JOC) Computerized Pricing Guide (CPG) WinEst. WinEst is a Windows based RS Means database program designed for IBM PC compatible computers. This CPG system has been selected for use as the cost basis for all work under the JOC and may also be used for negotiated orders under the Fort Lewis Multi Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC). The CPG contains more than 55,000 unit price construction line items for the description of work to be accomplished and for the unit of measure specified. Line item costs will be determined by multiplying the RS Means Bare Costs by the nearest available City Cost Index to localize the bare costs. The localized bare costs are then multiplied by the JOC or MATOC Contractor's coefficient. Cost estimates shall be automated utilizing the latest version of the automated pricing system. Multiple annual databases may be utilized depending on the date estimates are prepared or the terms of the individual JOC and MATOC. Effort may also include supporting government project managers in their negotiations with JOC and MATOC contractors prior to award of construction Task Orders. Designs may also include design-build projects requiring preparation of material takeoffs, bills of materials, and detailed designs. Projects are primarily architectural with related civil, mechanical and electrical work, including some asbestos and lead abatement work. Some examples of projects include: i. Renovation of existing buildings to include demolition, repair or replacement of building systems and components, interior design, and site improvements. Abate any asbestos directly related to the project including any associated landscaping architectural work. ii. Total renovation and restoration of administrative and barracks buildings, new facility construction, additions and renovations to existing facilities, road work, railroad, and bridgework. iii. Repair and construction projects involving HVAC systems and components, lighting, wiring, communications, fire protection and alarm systems, intrusion detection systems, CCTV, vehicle exhaust systems, and irrigation systems. iv. Construction management services to include evaluation of contractor designs, review and recommendation of material submittals, provision of random construction inspection and design of contract modifications beyond the original scope of design services. 4. Obtain the necessary permits, licenses, and approvals from all local, State and Federal authorities as necessary for the performance of the A-E's services. 5. Prepare informal shop drawings, abbreviated design analysis, and estimates incidental to the job for Task Order contracts, in-house construction, or troop construction. 6. Perform limited surveying and geotechnical services. 7. Implement the Fort Lewis Environmental Management System by committing to: i) Comply with all applicable environmental policy, laws, and regulations and The PW EMS which conforms to the criteria defined in the international standard, ISO 14001:2004 Environmental management systems. The installation's environmental policy can be found at www.lewis.army.mil/publicworks, click on Environmental, and then click on PW Environmental Policy. Additional information on the PW EMS can be obtained by contacting the PW EMS; ii) Identify potential sources of pollution and meet or exceed Army goals for prevention of pollution; iii) Assess the effect on the environment of activities, products, and services throughout their life cycles. Set objectives and targets to minimize adverse environmental impacts. Implement and monitor programs to achieve objectives and targets; iv) Actively pursue continual improvement in environmental management. 8. Prepare environmental studies and plans to include field investigations, data collection and analyses, report writing and remedial designs. 9. Incorporate the concept and principles of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) into planning and infrastructure maintenance and repair projects. LEED is defined as the systematic consideration of an activity, product or decision life-cycle impacts on the environment, energy use, natural resources, economy and quality of life. 10. Incorporate the concept and principles of Low Impact Development (LID) into planning and infrastructure construction and repair projects.

<a href="mailto:joy.bartlett@mail.va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR POTENTIAL OFFERORS.  Please reference Request for Proposal (RFP) number VA-791-10-RP-0031.  The Department of Veterans Affairs Denver Acquisition & Logistics Center, in support of Veterans Health Administration (VHA), intends to  solicit proposals from qualified offerors for a full range of medical disability examinations to include musculoskeletal; organs of sense; infectious , immune, and nutritional deficiencies; respiratory; cardiovascular; digestive; genitourinary; gynecological and breast; hemic and lymphatic; skin; endocrine; neurologic; mental disorders; dental; and oral examinations.  

Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) through the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) administers the Compensation & Pension (C&P) Program for benefits to Veterans, their dependents, and their survivors. Entitlement determinations for disability compensation claims and disability pension claims are made by VBA Rating Veterans Service Representatives (RVSRs) and Decision Review Officers (DROs) working in VA Regional Offices (VAROs) across the country.  Disability examinations are typically performed by Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinical staff. The requirement for examinations to be performed by non-VA providers is supplemental to VHA effort and is intended to provide the various military services within the Department of Defense with a vehicle to secure Disability Examination Services (DES) for active duty members through VHA, and allow a more efficient decision and transition to VA care after separation or retirement from active service.
	
Contract providers will be expected to follow established protocols for performing examinations. These protocols follow two specific sets of requirements. The first requirement set derives from C&P examination worksheets. These worksheets serve as policy framework for the examinations. The worksheets are further specified in templates. These templates provide detailed rules for performance of examinations. 

Disability examinations are critical pieces of evidence for determining the extent of permanent impairment, and thus the percent of disability that defines the benefits a Veteran is awarded.  Because it is so critical, the examination report must be of highest quality, providing valid, essential information to support each disability diagnosed, impairment statement and causality opinion. It is not enough to simply state a diagnosis and impairment statement and opinion if necessary. The examination report must provide detailed information sufficient for RVSRs and allow for the VA DROs to arrive at a determination that is able to withstand the scrutiny of appellate review.  Contracted providers will not issue eligibility decisions but provide some or most of the clinical support data to permit a timely review and decision from VA employees.

Contractor performance of these examinations may be required by any of the VA's Medical Centers throughout the United States including Asia (Naha Okinawa; Tokyo, Japan; Guam), Europe (Frankfurt, Germany), and Latin America (San Jose, Costa Rica; Mexico City, Mexico).   In addition to VA sites, the VA may require contractor support for participating Department of Defense (DoD) facilities in California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma Kentucky and Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington.

All providers shall have all licenses, permits, accreditation, and certificates required by law.  All must be graduates of an accredited medical school and licensed in the state where the examinations will occur.

The Government may award one or more firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contracts. The contract period will be from the date of contract award through September 30, 2011, with four one-year options to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. 

This procurement is being conducted under the authority of Title 38 U.S.C. Section 8153. The North American Classification Codes are 621111, 621112 and 524114 and the Small Business Size Standards are $7.5 Million, $7.5 Million and $5.0 Million respectively.  This is a full and open procurement for any and all qualified, experienced, and knowledgeable business entity(s) who can meet the requirements. 

Solicitation documents will be available electronically on or about November 17, 2010 at the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fbo.gov. NO HARD COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. The anticipated closing date is December 17, 2010 and anticipated award date is February 3, 2011. 

Questions should be forwarded to Joy Bartlett at: IDES@va.gov. 

NOTE:  EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2003, ALL CONTRACTORS MUST BE REGISTERED ON THE CCR WEBSITE AS AN ACTIVE VENDOR IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR AN AWARD AND TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS AGAINST AN EXISTING AWARD.  PLEASE BE SURE YOUR FIRM IS REGISTERED. THE WEBSITE URL IS: http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<BR><BR>Agent Based Game Human Behavior AI Architecture<BR><BR>Technology Survey<BR><BR>Purpose for the Request for Information (RFI):<BR><BR>This is not a solicitation for contract.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to survey Industry, Academia and Other Government Agencies (OGA) in order to collect information and data that would establish novel approaches to intelligent behaviors in virtual, constructive and gaming simulation technologies. These approaches will be goal-based, multi-agent, or similar non-deterministic artificial intelligence architectures to enable more diverse, dynamic and realistic human behaviors in simulation. The resultant architectures should be demonstrated in a virtual environment. Companies, universities and agencies interested in pursuing future research and development opportunities with the U.S. Army are invited to respond to this RFI. <BR><BR>Background:<BR><BR>The US Army and US Marine Corps have several virtual, constructive and gaming simulation training systems. These systems are used to train a wide variety of skills in both services from individuals basic military skills, such as first aid and language acumen, to collective staffs command and control execution. The fiscal, personnel and materiel costs of the preferred, live training are constantly increasing causing the services to continue to leverage existing simulation capabilities and develop new ones to complement and supplement that live training. <BR><BR>For most training applications, the current level of artificial intelligence is sufficient to set the appropriate conditions to meet training standards. For many others, such as those being designed to further develop small unit leaders, decision-making abilities, commodity artificial intelligence capabilities are not dynamic or complex enough to adequately set those training conditions. Due to the requirements to present complex situations and to allow, and even encourage, unpredicted trainee courses of actions, a very dynamic and interactive environment is required. To date, this flexibility and interaction has been provided by live role-players and operators, resulting in an exorbitantly high trainer-to-trainee ratio. A novel artificial intelligence architecture may be able to significantly reduce the number of facilitators required to effectively train many small-unit skills when incorporated in constructive and virtual simulation training systems.<BR><BR><BR>Specific Research Areas: <BR><BR>Commercial game developers generally use a well-orchestrated fusion of scripting,    algorithm-based artificial intelligence and plot and level design to achieve the desired look and feel  playability  of their games. All in all, this is a fairly rigid framework. To engender an adequately dynamic and interactive simulation environment in which to set training conditions, a different architecture is required. Central to this architecture is an improved artificial intelligence. Rather than relying solely on the current system of triggered scripts, a parametric goal-based artificial intelligence architecture could be developed which would be used to describe a multitude of behaviors from vehicles to human, whether friendly, hostile and neutral. Goal-based multi-agent systems are not necessarily new, but they have not been widely applied to constructive and virtual simulations. A dynamic artificial intelligence applied to existing and developing game-based simulations could expand the capabilities of simulations for training while reducing the manpower required to effectively employing it.<BR><BR>Industry, Academia and OGA Response Guidelines:<BR><BR>The following are suggested guidelines for the type of information that would be most useful to this RFI: <BR><BR>1.	Provide information that describes your company or organizations background, capabilities, and areas of expertise.  <BR><BR>2.	Describe your company or organizations recent research, developments, existing prototypes and systems fielded to the military or sold in the commercial market as it relates to this RFI.  Provide brochures, spec sheets, pictures and video clips of the system in use. <BR><BR>3.	Reference and/or provide recently published papers that address aspects of Agent Based Game Human Behavior AI architecture and integration that is applicable to the effort.<BR><BR>4.	All information submitted is covered under 18USC 1905 and will not be shared outside the Government. <BR><BR>For security reasons, please DO NOT submit material on memory devices that interface to USB ports, e.g. thumb drives, etc.  Submit information on compact disks (CD) and/or Digital Video Disks (DVD).  <BR><BR>This is not a solicitation for a contract.  Development and publication of a technology roadmap does not constitute Army / RDECOM/STTC direction to start any contractual efforts.  However, industry, academia and other government agencies are encouraged to participate in this survey and to provide any type and amount of information deemed appropriate.  The Government representative will provide feedback to all submissions.<BR><BR>Key Word Search:<BR><BR>Virtual world, game technology, architecture, 3-D, live-virtual-constructive, Artificial intelligence, multi-agent, goal-based, complex adaptive.<BR><BR>SUBMIT YOUR RESPONSES TO TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT:<BR><BR>Pat Garrity<BR>Chief Engineer Dismounted Soldier Training Technologies Soldier Simulation Environments Division <BR>U.S Army RDECOM Simulation & Training Technology Center<BR>12423 Research Parkway<BR>Orlando, Fl 32826-3274<BR>Phone: (407) 384-3663 <BR>Fax (407) 384-5454<BR>Cell:(321) 388-3116<BR>Pat.Garrity@us.army.mil<BR><BR>

<DESC>This announcement serves as a Sources Sought Notice issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation nor is this notice a Request for Proposals (RFP). <strong>DLA Troop Support is NOT requesting a quote or proposal in response to this notice</strong>. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by DLA Troop Support for any purpose. The Government does not intend to pay for information furnished pursuant to this RFI. The purpose for this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to support, this requirement. For the purpose of this acquisition, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 335129 - Other Lighting Equipment Manufacturing and the applicable size standard is 500 employees.
<p>DLA Troop Support seeks your expression of interest and any suggestion regarding DLA Troop Support's desire to establish supply support of a: <strong>Light Set, Chart, Field (NSN 6230-01-503-3158). </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Component Information</span>: The Army's transition to modular brigades, which is one of the major initiatives of the Army's transformation plan for modernization, involves migrating the Army from a division-centric force designed to fight one or two potential major-theatre wars toward a modular, brigade-centric force that is expeditionary in nature and deployed continuously in different parts of the world. This transformation spreads platoon and team sized elements across the battlefield, such that the 24/7 availability of electrical power is not always possible, and as such, an alternative provision for lighting without Mobile Electric Power (MEP) is necessary. Many small Command Posts (CPs) need lighting within tents and facilities and do not have a generator available, and the use of candles and lanterns can be unsafe and present logistic problems (batteries, fuel, etc), leaving units to find substitutes that present more problems than they solve.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements</span>:<strong> The Government has a need for portable battery powered illumination within operations centers, Command Posts (CPs), areas without other lighting, and for emergency and inspection purposes in a field environment when the use of generators is restricted or electrical power is unavailable. </strong>These light sets are also used during searches, inspections, field medical work, and urban operations, and provide a safer, longer duration, rechargeable lighting solution. There are numerous situations when running a generator is not advisable and connecting to a commercial power grid is not an option, but the work within a dark tent or shelter must continue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design and Construction</span>: The function of the Lighting Kit is to provide extended power, battery operated lighting at more than three times the life of a single battery charge/capacity. In a portable package, the soldier unit is able to charge up to 12 batteries at the same time, using any one of four different power sources. When battery powered lighting is required - four soldiers using belt packs can operate the 18 Volt (V) cordless floodlights and the 18V rotating headlights for at least nine hours each instead of the standard time provided by a single battery.</p>
<p><strong>This Lighting Kit requires two (2) Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) headlights and floodlights, twelve (12) battery packs, two (2) solar panels, four (4) belt packs, four (4) different "pig tail" power cords, a built-in controller/charger, spare bulbs and lens covers, all contained within an impact resistant, water-resistant storage/transport case on wheels. The transport case requires integrated recharging and battery maintenance management circuitry (i.e. the controller/charger), that can be recharged and powered using four different voltage sources: 12 VDC, 24 VDC, 110 VAC, and 220 VAC.</strong> The controller accepts electricity from the four different voltage sources and feeds it into the charger, which can charge and maintain up to 12 batteries at once. The soldier cannot connect a light directly to the controller/charger, because these lights can only be powered by a battery source (either from a single battery, or from the belt pack). To compensate for that, the kit includes four (4) triple battery belt packs that allow three of the 18V lighting batteries to be attached within each belt pack to power either the 18V cordless floodlight or 18V rotating headlight, providing 3X the lighting capability for four different soldiers at the same time. While a standard 18V battery powered lighting device has an estimated run time of about three hours, the belt packs allows the soldier to operate the Lighting Kit flashlights for nine or more hours from a single belt pack charge. <strong>The transport case is specially designed to fit in the rear of a HMMWV and has custom cut foam to safeguard the components during rough handling.</strong> The Light Set provides an instant inventory of lighting equipment, and contains a permanently affixed diagram showing the location of each component in its loaded position and includes identification data.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />FNS-11-023<br />Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought <br />Synopsis:
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.<br />This sources sought is being published to identify potential sources capable of providing services to include broad-based analytic projects, short studies, research and programming to support the Agency's microsimulation tools used to evaluate the cost and distribution impacts of proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) -</p>
<p>C.1 BACKGROUND<br />C.1.1 THE USE OF MICROSIMULATION IN SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP) POLICY ANALYSIS<br />Because of its size and high visibility in public forums, SNAP, the largest FNS nutrition assistance program, is the subject of intense scrutiny and periodic reform efforts. As part of its responsibility for administering SNAP, FNS relies heavily on microsimulation models and other analyses to estimate the impact of economic changes and program reforms on SNAP participation and costs. Simulations are used extensively during preparation of the President's budget submission and in response to Congressionally-proposed statutory changes.<br />In the past, FNS has made extensive use of computer simulation techniques to examine a wide variety of policy questions. Examples of such questions include:<br />&#61656; How many households and individuals are eligible for SNAP benefits under current rules?<br />&#61656; How would the number of eligible households and individuals change if program design parameters, such as income eligibility limits, asset limits, maximum benefits, or allowable deductions, were changed?<br />&#61656; How would such changes affect estimated participation levels and program costs?<br />&#61656; What effect would such changes have on different subgroups of participants, such as the elderly or workers?<br />In a typical year, an Administration submits proposals for the following budget year in February, shortly after the "State of the Union" address. For the eight or so months prior to that event, the Agency prepares the budget submission by estimating the cost of potential changes to SNAP rules. For example, the President's budget may contain a provision to raise the asset limit for SNAP eligibility, making some low-income persons newly eligible for benefits. The cost estimates are then generated based on model simulations.<br />Approximately every five years, the Congress reauthorizes SNAP. Reauthorization typically involves estimating the impacts of many program changes - both those initiated by the Administration and other stakeholders. Often the turn-around for completing these estimates is very short, i.e., not more than a business day. In the course of a year, the number of quick response requests can vary widely; in 2007-2008, only 52 Quick Response reform simulations, tabulations, or other analyses were required, whereas in 2008-2009, 180 Quick Response requests were conducted. <br />Out of the 180 Quick Responses conducted in 2008-2009, 99 were reform simulations, 80 were tabulations, and 1 was an informational request that did not require a reform simulation or a tabulation.<br />The current authorization (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246), also known as the 2008 Farm Bill) expires at the end of FY 2012. FNS anticipates that the volume of work will be heavy in 2011 and 2012, as the Agency generates cost estimates for a large number of alternative proposals.<br />C.1.2 DATA USED IN MICROSIMULATION ANALYSIS<br />FNS currently relies on four databases for most of its analyses:<br />&#61656; The March Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted by the Bureau of the Census, which contacts a large number of households and provides limited information about households' income, assets, and program participation;<br />&#61656; The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), also conducted by the Bureau of the Census, which is a survey with a smaller sample size containing more detailed information about households' income, assets, and program participation; and<br />&#61656; The SNAP Quality Control System (SNAP QC), which is a nationally and State representative sample of SNAP households, extracted from administrative caseload files.<br />&#61656; The American Community Survey (ACS), which is a project of the U.S. Census Bureau that replaces the long form in the decennial census. It is an ongoing statistical survey, and thus more current than information obtained by the long form.</p>
<p>Throughout the duration of the BPA, any service within the scope of the following general categories of work may be ordered at the task ordering level including but not limited to:<br />&#61656; Providing microsimulation and related analysis and support by estimating the effects of potential changes to nutrition assistance programs on the numbers and characteristics of eligible and participating persons and, on an ongoing basis as new data become available, preparing timely reviews, reports, and files;<br />&#61656; Supporting microsimulation and related analyses by acquiring new databases used in the microsimulation models as they become available; hosting the web-based models that FNS uses to develop in-house estimates; preparing, as needed, ad hoc updates and improvements to the models; updating the microsimulation models with the more current data, and by providing documentation; and training FNS staff on understanding and using the models, as needed.<br />&#61656; Conducting supporting research that uses the microsimulation models to learn more about the characteristics and behaviors of nutrition assistance program participants and other low-income individuals, and conducting other research that can provide information to improve the microsimulation models.<br />The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. The size standard for NAICS 541611 is $5M. Comments on this NAICS and suggestions for alternatives must include supporting rationale.<br />The Government requests that interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual gross revenue for the prior three (3) years), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small or large business). Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, would apply wherein at least 50 percent of the work must be performed by the small business prime contractor.<br />The Government requests that all interested parties submit a statement of capability outlining past work that is related to this requirement as stated below. The statement of capability shall include:<br />&#61656; Contractor Name<br />&#61656; Address<br />&#61656; Point of Contact (POC)<br />&#61656; POC phone number and e-mail address<br />&#61656; DUNS number<br />&#61656; Business status (i.e. large/small business, disadvantaged, Hub Zone, woman-owned, etc.)<br />&#61656; Brief description of the company's business size<br />&#61656; Anticipated teaming or subcontracting arrangements (delineate between work accomplished by prime and work accomplished by teaming partners)<br />&#61656; Experience and capability of performing Microsimulation analyses in accordance with C.1.1 and C.1.2 above.</p>
<p>Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP.<br />Contractors capable of providing these services should submit a Statement of Capability containing the above referenced information via e-mail to belal.hammad@fns.usda.gov no later than 4PM Eastern Standard Time, November 17, 2010.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought<br />We propose to study Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) as a suitable diagnostic for shock physics applications. This collaboration is to jointly study new methods in relativistic megavolt electron diffraction and examine feasibility of characterizing phase transitions with this technique. The proposed work scope encompasses a joint laboratory effort with equipment and personnel.<br />S-band linear accelerator requirement, photoinjector shall be capable of producing 108 electrons packed in bunches of ~ 100 fs length with 3.5 MeV energy and ultra low emittance. This accelerator has proven to be uniquely suited for shock experiments to study phase transitions on picosecond time scales. <br />The objective of this is to examine reflection mode. The reflection mode provides a useful geometry to investigate phase transitions of metal foils by laser induced shock waves. <br />We propose a four phase approach for the experiments. In phase I and II our focus will be to prove the concept of UED in the reflection mode. In phase III, we will study static phase transitions of selected metals using a cooling/heating multicenter sample handling system. Our final goal of this research in phase IV is to study phase transitions with the traditional pump (laser induced shock) and probe (UED) scheme.<br />Provide point of contact, capability statement and resumes of your key personnel to include unique qualifications and experience for this work.<br />

<SUBJECT>23--High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) Roll-Over Stability Control System Request for Information (RFI)
<SOLNBR>M6785411I5014
<RESPDATE>112410
<ARCHDATE>12092010
<CONTACT>Renee S. Staton

<a href="mailto:renee.staton@usmc.mil">renee.staton@usmc.mil</a>
<DESC>BACKGROUND  Force protection requirements necessitate the addition of as much as 4800 pounds of armor to some HMMWV variants which significantly degrades the vehicles dynamic performance.  Additional payload or any off-road operational scenarios further diminish the vehicles stability resulting in un-tripped, or maneuver-induced roll-over incidents.  Un-tripped and maneuver-induced roll-over refers to events where roll-over is spontaneous and not initiated by contact between the tires and a tripping mechanism (such as a curb, a soft shoulder, a ditch, loose gravel, a guard rail, etc.).  These events are often operator induced and/or exacerbated by excessive speed and large yaw inputs to the vehicle steering.
  The Government is seeking information regarding autonomous stability control systems that could be integrated on the existing HMMWV chassis with a minimum of impact.    

APPROACH  The Government intends to review candidate systems based on technical maturity, effectiveness, ease-of-integration, and cost to determine if potential technologies and systems exist.  Candidate systems must be fully developed and be easily integrated on existing up-armored HMMWVs with little, or no, degradation in vehicle operational effectiveness.  
 
RESPONSES  Interested vendors are invited to submit capability statements that address their recommended approach to integrating a stability control system into an existing HMMWV chassis as well as their ability and experience in performing these tasks.
  This capability statement should address whether the Offeror produces stability control systems for commercial or non-commercial markets, or both. Responses should include the firms business size, SBA certification, and GSA schedule contract number, as applicable, and a rough-order of magnitude (ROM) price for one (1) kit.  Responses shall not exceed ten (10) pages.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government for any follow-on action.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.
  The Government recognizes that proprietary information and data may be part of this effort and, if so included, such data should be clearly marked and included as a proprietary addendum to the non-restricted/non proprietary information.  Responses to this RFI shall be e-mailed Attn: Rene Staton at renee.staton@usmc.mil no later than 2:00 PM EST on 24 Nov 2010.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>Request for Information
 Strategic Capital Investment Planning Automation Tool (SCIP SAT) Acquisition and Integration


THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, a Solicitation, a Request for Quote or, an indication that the Government will award a contract for the items contained in this RFI. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or, reimburse expenses incurred for responses to this RFI. Companies are encouraged to respond if they have the capability and/or capacity to provide the software and services identified below. Respondents should identify their company name, address, email, telephone number and a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with government representatives. Respondents are requested to identify any applicable schedule contract numbers and any additional information applicable to this RFI. Submissions are due NO LATER THAN December 1, 2010 at 3:00 P.M. EST.  This RFI notice is part of the Government's Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information from industry, with respect to their current and near-term abilities.

Background: 

The principle purpose of the SCIP Automation Tool (SAT) is to create a web-based, interoperable system to collect the data necessary to understand and evaluate the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) infrastructure and service gaps and to develop both capital and non-capital solutions to address these gaps by 2021.  The SAT Program is in direct support of the Secretary's Major Initiative #14, Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and is identified in the SCIP Operating Plan. The SAT Long Term Solution is a sub-project of the SAT Program. 

The SAT will collect the input data required to integrate VA's various capital investment planning efforts for major construction, minor construction, non-recurring maintenance and leasing into one process.  The input data will be evaluated against the Department-wide 10-year Strategic Capital Plan that addresses each of the identified gaps. 

The objective of the SAT is to collect data for the capital asset improvement projects in a format that has the capability to analyze and prioritize such projects based on the following criteria: 1) mission requirements, 2) mitigation of critical gaps in access, utilization, space, facility condition, energy, safety, parking, and IT, and 3) emphasis on Initiative 14 of the 16 Secretarial Major Initiatives.

Requested Information:

Interested sources are encouraged to provide a general capabilities statement to address the information requested below and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to complete the effort.  
1. The SAT should be designed using a common theme across all functional areas.  This theme should be both user-friendly and highly functional at the same time.  Information provided for the SAT should include: 
a.	Each Gap area should be presented such that there are pre-populated fields with gap data and user input fields for data collection.  Fields should be clearly marked as reference or data input ready.
b.	All tables should have both row and column totals.
c.	All numeric fields should be formatted as either whole numbers (comma as thousands separator, no decimal), currency (comma as thousands separator, dollar sign, no decimals), or percents (percent sign, two decimal points).
d.	Business rules are executed against both targets and upper/lower bounds around these targets.  These numbers can change so updatable parameters (Administrator access only) that drive these targets are required.
e.	Provide a data report detailing length of instrument and average time to complete and/or other user statistics 
f.	Provide a detailed manual and description of the capability for modifying existing SAT query items, branching logic, decision algorithms, as well as adding new question items/logic/algorithms and modifying responses and feedback to users. This will ensure content is appropriate and targeted for the user population and whether non-technical staff are capable of making modifications.  
g.	All reports and data extracts should be exportable into MS Excel/CSV format.

2. Information about the SAT user interface design. This includes the following:
a.	Overall functionality and user-friendliness of the graphical user interface and how individuals progress through the SAT from start to finish.
b.	The individual completing the SAT analysis and report must be able to perform functions within the system, such as printing, saving, and modifying individual SAT item responses.
c.	Results of usability testing of the graphical user interface with users.
d.	Compliance with Section 508 requirements (http://www.section508.gov/)

3. Information about the technical specifications and operating requirements for deploying the SAT within the operating environment in real-time, including but not limited to the following:
a.	Hardware requirements for optimum functioning of the SAT

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />5.2 Atlantic Test Range<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />1.0 Description</span></strong></p>
<p>1.1 The Naval Air Warfare Systems Command (NAWCAD) in support of the 5.2 Atlantic Test Range is seeking information regarding the follow on effort for Range Support Services.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, at this time, the Navy is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the NAWCAD Central website at http://www.navair.navy.mil/ , or the Navy's electronic platform for acquiring services (Seaport) at http://www.seaport.navy.mil/default.aspx. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2.0 Background</strong></span></p>
<p>The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is seeking information regarding a technical, engineering, project management, administrative, logistics, security, and IT support services requirement to support the Atlantic Test Range and its operations. Services will be provided for three business units provided below:</p>
<p>Atlantic Target and Marine Operations Division (AIR-5.3.3):</p>
<p>The Atlantic Target and Marine Operations Division provides sea, air, and land targets for testing and training events. The division provides the personnel and surface assets to support the range safety clearance function, to conduct at sea testing, and to recover test articles that have been dropped on the over-water range areas.</p>
<p>Atlantic Test Range (ATR) Facility:</p>
<p>The Atlantic Test Range Facility provides the people, skills, knowledge, processes, facilities, and equipment required for the development, test, operation, and maintenance of various systems required to operate the open-air test facilities. The Atlantic Test Range Facility applies these skills and knowledge to support requirements for test operations.</p>
<p>Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation (AVMI) Facility.</p>
<p>Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation (AVMI) designs, develops, procures, builds, installs, tests and evaluates, calibrates, modifies, operates and maintains instrumentation on aircraft and engines for the Navy and other government, commercial and foreign government customers. AVMI is the lead for developing future network-based data acquisition systems. In addition, AVMI provides technical consultation to NAVAIRSYSCOM, OPNAV, DOD, contractors, and field activities and other government agencies.</p>
<p>2.1 Delivery Period:</p>
<p>Services to be provided will be required for either a 3 or 5 year period from date of contract award. Estimated timeframe for contract award is August to September 2012.</p>
<p>2.2 Limitations:</p>
<p>Currently, there are no limitations associated with this effort; however, as a result of continued market research the government reserves the right to set aside either a portion or all of this effort for small business.</p>
<p><br />2.3 Security Requirements:</p>
<p>A security clearance is not required for all personnel in the specific labor categories; however, the ability to obtain a clearance is required for all personnel. Therefore, the contractor shall submit for government approval, and when required by individual tasking, a classified visit request for any contractor personnel requiring access to secured areas on or off-site. The request shall be addressed to the security office of the hosting site and contain the following; an alphabetical listing of contractor personnel with date of birth, place of birth, social security number, clearance status, contract number, site point of contact and duration of visit.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3.0 Requested Information:</strong></span></p>
<p>Performance Work Statement (PWS) DRAFT:</p>
<p>1. The Government is currently in the process of restructuring the Range Performance Work Statement (PWS) and is considering segregating the PWS into multiple requirements which could lead to the award of either a Multiple Award Contract (MAC) or multiple Seaport task orders.<br />a. Please provide recommendations on what factors should be considered when determining whether the attached Draft PWS structure should be modified? <br />b. Additionally, recommendations on the factors that should be considered with regard to separation of tasking (i.e., is there a benefit to separating the tasks into multiple contracts, if separation occurs does it make more sense to segregate tasks by business unit, competency, or functional area (Engineering services, Admin, etc.), etc.)? <br />c. Finally, how does each of these strategies affect your likelihood to bid?</p>
<p>2. Would the issuance of a solicitation in Seaport-E maximize or limit competition? <br />a. Does your company currently hold an account in Seaport-E and are you eligible to propose on requirements executed in Zone 2?</p>
<p>3. The Government is in the process of identifying efficiencies in regard to execution of the PWS in the areas of cost and performance. Considering this goal, as well as the need to support tasking identified in the attached Draft PWS:<br />a. What factors (including positive and negative) should be considered when attempting to create increased efficiencies? <br />b. What factors (including positive and negative) should be considered when contemplating separation of tasks within the structure of the PWS or by creating multiple PWSs?</p>
<p>4. Upon reviewing the attached Draft PWS, what are the main variables/factors considered when making a determination to bid or not to bid (i.e., CLIN structure, contract type, contract length, subcontracting goals, socio-economic programs, incentives, period of performance, contract historical data). What should the Government consider:<br />a. To enhance competition?<br />b. To increase Small Business participation?<br />c. To reduce costs?<br />d. To acquire the appropriate skill mix?<br />e. To maximize understanding and to clarify tasking?<br />f. What recommendations should be considered to ensure the objectives and outcomes are clearly identified?</p>
<p>5. Is the PWS written with sufficient detail to propose as an incentive type contract?</p>
<p>In regards to Small Business Opportunities:</p>
<p>6. How could the PWS be structured or broken out to better allow maximum practicable opportunity for small business participation?</p>
<p>7. Would the period of performance (5 vice 3 years) impact small business likelihood to bid?</p>
<p>8. What percentages of the various small business socio-economic categories (e.g, Veteran Owned, 8-a, Hubzone, etc.) are achievable in specific tasking areas and/or overall? What tasking would small business be most able to perform?</p>
<p>In regards to the Period of Performance / Proposal Turn-Around:</p>
<p>9. The Government is currently assessing the impact of a 3 year Seaport order versus a 5 year MAC to support the requirements set forth in the attached Draft PWS. <br />a. What impacts, advantages, and/or disadvantages should be considered in this analysis? <br />b. Which contract (3 year Seaport or 5 year MAC) would provide the most incentive to offerors to submit a proposal. Please discuss your reasoning?</p>
<p>10. In the event of a MAC type contract award, it is possible the government will require responses to task order request for proposals (TORPs) in a compressed timeframe. What is the minimum amount of time required to submit a fully compliant task order proposal for the following dollar thresholds?<br />a. $5 Million<br />b. $10Million<br />c. &gt; $25 Million</p>

<p><br />WAWF INSTRUCTIONS <br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DOD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DOD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact.</p>
<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988.</p>

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.</p>

Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.</p>
<p>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>
<p>(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>(3) For long-term contracts--</p>
<p>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Chemical and Biological Division (CBD) seeks technologies to prevent and defend against a chemical and biological attack. Within the Chemical and Biological Division is the Threat Characterization and Attribution (TCA) Branch, which has the mission to conduct threat and risk assessments on both traditional and advanced agents; conduct experiments to close major scientific knowledge gaps; provide scientific support to the biodefense, chemical defense and intelligence communities; and provide the Nation with an operational biological and chemical forensics capability. The Chemical Forensics Program supports the latter part of the above TCA mission. The threat of terrorist or criminal use of chemical threat agents is of great concern in the United States. There are vulnerabilities that create the need to perform chemical analyses for attribution in a rigorous scientific manner. As part of the effort to deter criminal and terrorist chemical attacks and strengthen the law enforcement response to such an act, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 22, a classified document dealing with domestic chemical defense, was issued. An unclassified portion of this document addresses attribution as a means of identifying the nature and source of materials, the perpetrators and the methods of chemical attacks. <br />The primary internal customers of the Chem FP are law enforcement and intelligence components of the DHS, and the primary external customer is the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) due to its lead investigative agency role in acts of terrorism. This BAA seeks to provide sound scientific techniques related to supporting attribution analyses leading to the capture, indictment, and prosecution of the perpetrator(s) of a criminal or terrorist act involving the actual or threatened use of CTAs.

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>C2IS and C2AOS are companion programs intended to develop, field, and sustain modular net-centric Command and Control (C2) applications and data management solutions for current and future C2 systems that are not planned or delivered by systems of record (SoR). As such, C2IS and C2AOS will address many of the functional requirements that are currently met by the operationally-fielded Theater Battle Management Core System-Force Level (TBMCS-FL). C2IS and C2AOS will deliver software capabilities intended to execute on an "externally-provided" infrastructure such as the Air Force's Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System (WS), AN/USQ 163, or the Navy's Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES). C2IS and C2AOS alone and/or together do not yield "systems" but rather contribute distinct capabilities and functionality to "host systems" that are managed or provided by other programs. NOTE: Please disregard previous information posted on the Command and Control Air Operation Suite page. For updated information on C2IS/C2AOS please refer to this page.

<DESC><p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, intends to award a contract for support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network Support for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS) ensuring critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN).</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data. Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities. Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Network Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This synopsis is to make available a notice of proposed contract action as required by FAR 5.201. The government intends to issue a Request for Proposals, FA2550-09-R-8001, on or before 1 December 2010, soliciting proposals from all interested, responsible offerors. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 ($27M).</span></p>
<p>A Pre-Proposal Conference/Site Visit is tentatively scheduled to be held at Schriever AFB at 8:30am MST on 8 December 2010. A Secret security clearance will be required for any attendees to the site visit. Each company will be restricted to two attendees. Specific details will be included in Section L of the solicitation, so all interested offerors are advised to review that information when posted to ensure all required notifications are completed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program management office or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman can be reached at HQ AFSPC/A7K, 719-554-5250.</p>

<RESPDATE>111010
<CONTACT>Kimberly Dvila, Email kimberly.davila@dia.mil - Allison Richards, Contract Specialist, Email allison.richardson@dia.mil
<DESC><p><br />The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions:<br /><br />QUESETION: I am working to submit on the Empire Challenge capability with new software for CI/HUMINT. I do not possess a facility clearance. Is it still possible for me to submit or should I partner with someone else?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: You may respond at the onset but further on you will likely need to partner with someone.</p>
<p>QUESTION: There is some question as to the type response and/or responses required of a contractor to be able to gain an invitation to participate in EC2011. IN your recent announcement, there are two paragraphs that address response formats; however, it appears there may be confusion or conflict regarding the expectation for submissions to respond to each of them.</p>
<p>Specifically, paragraph 10. A. says:<br />10. Submission Format and Due Date <br />a. Each proposed capability will submit a two-page white paper and a PowerPoint quad chart. The white paper (Arial, 12pt, 1" margins) must: <br />1) Describe capability functionality. <br />2) Identify specific support to JCTs and Objectives (paragraph 2 above). <br />3) Provide answers to capability requirements (paragraph 6 above). <br />4) Identify requirements for networks and communications, asset and personnel support. <br />5) Provide contact information for program and technical POCs. <br />b. The quad chart must include a summary of white paper content (upper left); identification of JCT and Objectives support (lower left); a capability OV1 with information data flow (upper right); and, a description of capability maturity, funding status and support requirements (lower right).</p>
<p>while paragraph 12 says:<br />12. Responses <br />Interested vendors shall email a capability statement in response to the requested information above prior to 10:00am Wednesday, 10 November 2010. Submissions shall be limited to 25 one-sided pages and should be Office 2007 compatible. All submissions must be sent via email and will be printed in black and white, with one inch margin on the top, bottom, left and right in a 12 point font, single line spacing. Each footer shall be 10 point font or larger and must contain the Offeror's name and page number as well as total pages (Offeror X, Page 1 of 5, etc.). Colored graphs and intricate drawings are discouraged. Submissions will not be returned. Responses should include, but are not limited, to the following: <br />(1) Offeror's full company name and mailing address. <br />(2) Point of contact's name, email address and telephone number. <br />(3) Socio-economic status under the NAICS 541690 (e.g., small business, etc.).<br />(4) Offeror's CAGE to verify the Offeror's facility clearance as well as the CAGE of any possible subcontractor. <br />(5) Explanation of contractor's DOD cleared personnel. <br />(6) Experience, preferably within the past three years as a prime contractor, as it relates to this anticipated requirement. Include: name of project, brief description of project, contract type, client (agency/company name), dollar value, and period of performance. <br />This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. This Is Not a Request for Proposals. The Government will not award a Purchase order or Contract based upon vendor responses to this announcement. The Government shall not assume any costs for preparing or submitting any information in response to the market survey or the Government's use of the information. Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as "proprietary information". Respondents will not be notified of the results of this evaluation.</p>
<p>Should we respond to one or both of these guidelines?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Please follow paragraph #10 information.</p>
<br />**NOTE: Submission date remains unchanged as no later than 10:00am Wednesday, 10 November 2010.<br />

<DESC>The passage of the patient protection affordable care act (PPACA) mandates postponement of the implementation of RUG-IV for one year, until October 1, 2011. It also requires the earlier implementation of two key policy changes, concurrent therapy and the look-back period. Prior to PPACA, these two policies were to be implemented with RUG-IV. In order to comply with these aspects of the PPACA it is necessary to establish an interim RUG known as Hybrid (HR) III. Establishing HR-III will facilitate earlier implementation of the two policies will also serve as a bridging system between the existing RUG-III and delayed Rug- IV. Thus the period of performance for the work needed to address the unusual and compelling urgency is September 29, 2010 through September 30, 2011.

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The VA Long Beach Network 22 Logistics Office, 5901 E. 7th Street, Long Beach, California, as directed by the VA Long beach Healthcare System will enter into a Purchase Order that requires justification for other than full and open competition.

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  The Purchase of Autopsy Services in the interim of the completion for an Autopsy services contract for the VA Long Beach Health Care System.

3. Description of Requirement:  The awarded contractor is to provide Autopsy assistance and autopsy review for a six month period at the VA Long Beach Hospital. The estimated cost is $34450.
 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The product(s) and or service(s) are being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. (c) (2), FAR Part 6.302-2(a).

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: FAR Part 6.302-2 allows for the use of other than full and open market competitive procedures when an agency's need for supplies or services presents an unusual and compelling urgency and delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other harm, to the government.  The VA Long Beach Healthcare system requires additional Autopsy Pathologists to meet the demand of today's hospital environment.  Without additional assistance to carry out these services, the deaths of many veterans may be potentially misdiagnosed which could lead to significant costs in potential legal claims of the deceased's families.  In addition, significant harm may occur in the misdiagnosis of an infectious disease that could potentially affect other patients within the hospital such as a meningitis breakout which requires immediate identification to successfully contain.  To meet this current unusual need, David G. Reidy shall be awarded a six month interim contract while contracting personnel complete a full five year contract for these necessary services.    

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  Other vendors have been identified that may potentially offer these services, though they must be properly evaluated before allowed to commence work.  David G. Reidy however has proven to be a highly qualified and dependable individual pathologist working closely with VA Long Beach system for many years.  Any new pathologists would require careful screening before allowed to work which would cause unacceptable delays for these services to commence.  A notice shall be publicized for the award of this purchase order.

7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable when compared to other similarly experienced pathologists.

8. Results of Market Survey: Market research indicates other vendors may be able to perform these services, but they must first be thoroughly evaluated through full and open competition procedures using a tradeoffs evaluation to ensure that these vendors will fulfill the strict standards of the VA Long Beach Healthcare System.

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Items 5 above.

10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that have expressed an interest to date.  


11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: The Government shall solicit for these services through full and open market procedures using a tradeoffs evaluation.  This purchase order shall act as an interim between the present time and the award of the future contract to the successful vendor of that procurement.

12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the Center for Acquisition Innovation (CAI) Frederick, Frederick, MD.

2.  Nature/Description of Action.

This activity proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award (sole source) with Halfaker and Associates, LLC, for the procurement of the Annual National Veterans Small Business Conference support services. 

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.

The Veterans Affairs Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) is responsible for the planning, implementation, and execution of programs which impact the involvement of Small Business (SB) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), and businesses in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone).  This responsibility also includes the planning of activities and management of the Mentor Protg Program (MPP).  Specific categories of support include but are not limited to: Database Management, Statistical Analysis and Reporting, Outreach, Conference/Symposia, Website Management, Reports, Program Management, Advanced Acquisition Forecast, Market Research, Program Area Support, Administrative Support and Special Assignments.  This contract is intended to provide quick-reaction professional, technical, analytical and management resources and support to supplement in house expertise. 

VA OSDBU serves as advisor to the Secretary of the VA on small business related matters in support of the VAs mission.  The office also spearheads initiatives to maximize business opportunities for small business by synchronizing critical resources through extensive marketing counseling, and training.  VA OSDBU provides policy, guidance, direction, and education to the VA acquisition community to assist in the implementation of the VA Small Business Program.

 For the last six years the Army Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) has contracted to provide the Annual National Veteran Small Business Conference, VA OSDBU identifies the need to continue this and other national conferences in support of SDVOB/VOSB. Therefore, the purpose of this requirement is to establish a contract for the Annual National Veterans Small Business Conference.  The estimated value of this requirement is $380,533.13 for one year and $2,020,302.06, inclusive of the 60 month period of performance.  

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.

The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 
10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.  The applicable statute is Public Law 109-461, Veterans First Contracting Program.


5.  Demonstration of Contractors Unique Qualifications.

Halfaker and Associates, LLC has successfully provided National Veterans Small Business Conference support services for the Army in the past.  

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.

A notice of intent to sole source will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunity System pursuant to the Federal Register Vol. 74, No. 234 (Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Acquisition Regulation Supporting Veteran-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses) Final Rule #5.  Future competition for award will be considered on a case-by-case basis for award.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices.

No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on sources such as comparison of other contracts for same or similar services, the contractors public price list, Internet Search Engines and Halfaker and Associates quote.

8.  Description of Market Survey.

Market research was conducted using VetBiz.gov.  We determined that Halfaker and Associates, LLC is a responsible source with respect to this contracting opportunity.  They are registered and certified in VetBiz.gov as a SDVOSB with the NAICS code for this requirement which in accordance with Public Law 109-461 Section 502(c) meets the requirements of this statute to sole source to a SDVOSB.

9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

PL109-461 Section 502(c) states:

SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS FOR CONTRACTS ABOVE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD.  For purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans using procedures other than competitive procedures if:

(1)	Such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;
(2)	The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403)) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and
(3)	In the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.

This procurement meets all of these conditions.
