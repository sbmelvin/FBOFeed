This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The pre-solicitation number is </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-fareast-font-family: ">N02RC42580-83</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 20) 05-72, (January 2014) Simplified Procedures for a Commercial Item. The Government contemplates only one award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. The Associated North America Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 334516 and the Business Size Standard are 500. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. Delivery will be 60-90 days from date of award.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology (LCMB) investigates normal cellular signal transduction and aberrations in signaling pathways that are associated with neoplasias in humans and model systems. LCMB scientists have been very successful in using imaging approaches to study these topics. Five years ago, NCI acquired a Nikon TIRF microscope and the LCMB began to develop techniques using Photo Activation Localization Microscopy (PALM), which allows localization of genetically encoded proteins to within 20 nm. This project has been very successful, resulting in several publications. As a result, NCI would now like to expand its super-resolution capabilities to include Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), which allows localization of antibody labeled molecules. STORM will allow NCI to resolve the location of endogenous proteins and phosphorylated proteins to within 20 nm, a significant expansion of the LCMB high resolution capabilities. Projects are underway to determine the composition and time dependent changes in protein complexes formed during the activation of receptors at the single molecule level. Once the upgrade is implemented, the system can be used for both PALM and STORM imaging by any investigator who uses the LCMB Microscopy Core.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology (LCMB) requires improvement to the LCMB's TIRF microscope for experiments involving the observation of endogenous or phosphorylated proteins with resolution of structures to within 20-40 nm in three dimensions by Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM). These experiments require imaging equipment with sufficient sensitivity to visualize single molecules, lasers powerful enough to use the STORM technique and software capable of producing STORM images.</span></p>

These studies will lead to better risk stratification of patients with LFS, and advance understanding of the consequences of a germline <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">TP53 </em>mutation, findings that may also be broadly applicable to sporadic cancers of the type seen in LFS.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for the Acquisition of a Wide field High-Content Analysis Microscope System

For questions on this requirement and to submit capability statements please contact keith.costantino@va.gov or 412-822-3438 no later than August 6, 2014

Title: Wide field High-Content Analysis Microscope System

Background: 
The VA Medical Center in Durham NC is in need of a wide field high content microscope capable of providing automated cellular imaging in fluorescent, transmitted light, and phase-contrast modes for fixed- or live-cell assays,  the installation of the system and professional training.

Scope:
Purchase of an ImageExpress Micro High Content Screening System, On-site installation and training, and 12-month warranty. This is a one-time purchase for use in a research laboratory. 

Delivery: The delivery of the equipment shall be at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center Durham, NC 27705. The Government requires a period not to exceed thirty (30) days after receipt of deliverable items for inspection and acceptance or rejection.

Salient Characteristics:
1. Field of view of 4.66 megapixels allows for faster imaging and less data processing as well as larger easier to analyze images. Captures an entire 96 well in one image. This allows large yeast bodies to be imaged in one picture. 
2. Optically encoded linear motors for better than 100nm stage resolution in x, y, and z axes: Allows for images crossing fields of views to line up accurately without stitching images further. Large objects at high magnification can then be accurately put back together and analyzed. 
3. Four (4) User changeable objectives and five (5) user changeable filters:  Ability to switch objectives and filters at will without a service call or down time.
4. The ability to use 1-100X objectives, 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 100X at Plan APO, Plan Fluor and ELWD: This allows the greatest flexibility of objectives  
5. High Speed laser autofocus: Enhances accuracy and speed of detection over slower image based systems.
6. Transmitted Light capability with Phase Contrast tower: Necessary because images taken with Phase Contrast have greater contrast and ability to be analyzed. Also allows for better control over the sample imaged. 
7. Built in Application Modules for varying types of Plug N Play analysis: Has modules such as Cell Proliferation, Apoptosis, Migration, Cell Counting for full and fast analysis of the images with over 50 parameters outputted. 
8. Digital Confocal de-convolution on the fly: Necessary for imaging a Z-stack through a thick sample such as yeast and reassigning out of focus light to sharpen the sample and improve image and data quality.

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
