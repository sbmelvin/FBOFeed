<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">30 Nov 2015</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized and award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays and duplication of costs in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10 by issuing a synopsis of the proposed STEC14 acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties. While industry interest in the STEC14 effort indicates that there are other companies that may be capable of performing the requirements, none have the ability to perform in the timeframe needed for this bridge effort apart from the incumbent. Based on the program office estimate of up to nine months to conduct a competition, and up to two months of transition to familiarize the new contractor with the requirements, there are no other companies that have the capability to provide the required services without causing an unacceptable delay.</p>
<p>This sole source contract will allow the incumbent, LinQuest Corporation, to provide continuing satellite operations support at SMC/ADG's Research Development Test and Evaluation Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM. The existing/current STEC Bridge contract will expire 31 Jan 2016, there is continuing need to maintain the capability to conduct RSC mission operations to (1) support commanding, telemetry and payload processing for four on-orbit satellites; (2) planning and pre-launch preparation for five upcoming satellite missions, and (3) provide operations expertise for ground system modernization and automation. The current contractor possesses the required experience, as demonstrated on the current STEC Bridge contract: commanding, telemetry and payload support for satellite operations; mission design and pre-launch readiness; and operations support for major upgrades to the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) ground architecture. Additional sustainment work in support of automated operations for the Operationally Responsive Space 1 (ORS-1) spacecraft supported by the 3rd Space Experimentation Squadron (3SES) at Schriever AFB, CO is also included in this contract. The period of performance will consist of a two (2)-month base period with two (2) additional 2-month options and will not exceed a total of six (6) months if all options are exercised.</p>
<p>The scope of this next bridge effort, which will henceforth be referred to as "STEC Bridge II"; is the same as scope defined by the current STEC Bridge contract. The effort includes (1) on-orbit operations support (e.g., mission planning, contact execution, data analysis and distribution, (2) orbit analysis and anomaly response) for 4 on-orbit satellites; (3) mission design and pre-launch readiness for five upcoming missions; ground system automation for two on-orbit missions; and (4) operations expertise for upgrades to the MMSOC ground system architecture. This sole source action will result in a contract with pricing requirements to include cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) line items, with an estimated contract value of $5.04M. The sole purpose of this contract is to ensure these critical mission requirements continue uninterrupted until competitive award of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>The Government has been contracting with LinQuest Corporation for the continued satellite operations support on a sole source basis because of unforeseen delays in attempting to competitively award a new follow-on contract and due to the continuing need to maintain the capability to conduct RSC mission operations as aforementioned above. Any persons or companies interested in this notice are to respond to the requirement(s) and submit their capabilities to the Procurement Contracting Officer; Mr. J. Chris Milburn via e-mail at joe.milburn@us.af.mil . The capabilities statement should address why the company believes that the prior sole source justification is no longer valid.</p>
<p>While this notice of intent is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties (to include small and small disadvantaged businesses) may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information for consideration by the agency. Please keep the responses to 15 one-sided pages or less, with 1-inch margins on all sides, and in Times New Roman 12-point font. This announcement constitutes the only notice for this STEC Bridge II effort.</p>
<p>The incumbent is the only contractor who currently can provide RSC operations support given the unique and highly specialized nature of the effort. At this time, there are no other contractors who are capable of providing these services without incurring an unacceptable delay to on-going operations. As stated previously, a competitive award will be made for the follow-on STEC14 effort. The STEC14 source selection is currently in progress. The Government will post notices regarding that acquisition to FedBizOpps.<br /><br />The applicable NAICS code is 541712 with a corresponding size standard of 1,000 employees.&nbsp; Classification code is 'R" Professional, Administrative and Management Support Services--R425, Engineering and Technical Services.</p>

<DESC>This announcement was previously posted under solicitation number <strong>W91CRB-15-R-0047</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">This announcement is not a request for proposals. Contractors shall not submit proposals in response to this notice.<br /><br />Generation II Advanced Bomb Suit (GEN II ABS) - for PEO Soldier</p>
<p>Proposed Solicitation Number: W91CRB-16-R-0002</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground is issuing this pre-solicitation notice to announce the intent to issue a solicitation for the GEN II ABS.</p>
<p>Estimated Solicitation Issue Date: On or before 22&nbsp;November 2015 with all documents, attachments and amendments posted at the FedBizOpps website located at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov. No hard copies of the RFP will be issued. All respondents shall be responsible for obtaining the documentation from the website listed above.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure this requirement on an unrestricted, full and open procurement using procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 315990 Apparel Accessories and Other Apparel Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), in support of Program Executive Office - Soldier (PEO Soldier), Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) has a requirement for Gen II ABS systems. The current Advanced Bomb Suit (ABS) ensemble, consisting of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) 8 bomb suit and EOD 9 Gen 2 helmet, is too heavy/bulky, restricts mobility and dexterity, and has limited sizing for full body protection and efficient utilization for US Army EOD Soldiers. Further, the current ABS lacks an effective integrated cooling system capability.</p>
<p>In response to the constantly changing and increased threats encountered, the Army has identified a need to improve and redesign the ABS ensemble to provide not only a higher level of protection, but also to improve the mobility and capability of the EOD Soldier. The Army will be seeking improvements to the helmet and suit of the ABS as a system and, individually. Further it is important to highlight that the Generation II Advanced Bomb Suit (Gen II ABS) is a Non-Developmental Item (NDI), which asks Industry to propose existing, complete designs that are either in production or waiting for a requirement to begin production.</p>
<p>The US Army intends to place the best available Non-Developmental GEN II ABS in the hands of the Warfighter as quickly as possible. The Solicitation will use Best Value with Price Tradeoff were Soldiers feedback is significantly more important than price. Industry designs with no Government design participation will be exclusively evaluated for this program. Executed in two phases, Evaluation (Phase 1) and Production (Phase 2), this solicitation will support the evaluation of multiple designs and allow Soldiers to select the highest rated system to receive FAT approval.</p>
<p>Phase 2 Production will be executed as a requirements contract with an estimated initial quantity of 153 (10% of the ABS Army Acquisition Objective) systems and estimated maximum quantity of 1,538 (full AAO) systems.</p>
<p>A reduction in weight, improved sizing tariff, and integrated cooling capability are the focus of this improvement effort. The number one objective of the Gen II ABS is to reduce weight while improving form, fit, and function. To achieve this, new ballistic, fragmentation, and blast protection materials offer the potential for significant weight reduction while providing the same level of protection or better. Further, the Army is seeking an expanded sizing tariff for the helmet and suit to improve the fit and function for each EOD Soldier. Finally, the Army is seeking to leverage dramatic improvements in cooling system technology by incorporating an enhanced integrated cooling system into the suit.</p>
<p>Based upon these requirements, the following improvements are proposed as they have potential to provide immediate impact for EOD Soldiers:</p>
<p>&bull; Weight: The weight and weight distribution of the ABS ensemble must not significantly impede mission efficiency. The current ABS weighs 74 pounds for a size medium. The objective for the GEN II ABS is to reduce the weight of the current ABS by approximately 15% to 40%</p>
<p>&bull; Size: A lack of proper sizing increases the ABS' system weight issue. Currently there are only four sizes for the ABS suit (small, medium-small, medium and large) and a single helmet with a series of adjustment pads to fit the full sizing tariff. Updated anthropometric data on the US Army Soldier population indicates the need for new sizing. Specifically the Gen II ABS shall be designed to accommodate the full range of user personnel, i.e., 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male for full body protection and efficient utilization by EOD Soldiers.</p>
<p>&bull; Improved Cooling System. EOD technicians require an integrated cooling system to keep core body temperatures within normal range in hot environments. Prolonged exposure to high physical output and temperatures rapidly degrades the operator's ability to effectively perform their duties. The current ABS cooling system is not integrated (adds time to don/doff) and is dependent upon readily available ice in order to provide temperature cooling inside of the bomb suit. Both of these inherent design characteristics make the system unfavorable for Soldiers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Information</span>:</p>
<p>Offerors shall be able to deliver one (1) medium Gen II ABS end item with all components with ballistic test data from an NIJ certified lab within sixty (60) calendar days AFTER release of solicitation.</p>
<p>The Gen II ABS system, in any of its configurations, is considered a critical safety item (CSI). All items being procured under this acquisition are subject to the Buy American Act and Berry Amendment.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding up three (3) FFP contracts, one contract per system design under Phase One, and one (1) FFP Requirements contract with a four (4) year ordering period under Phase Two. Awards will be made to the best overall proposals (Best Value), which are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK
Electrical Substation Data Logging
Northport, NY
PART 1. GENERAL INFORMATION:
A. INTRODUCTION:
The scope of this contract is to provide the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the
cost estimate, purchase, installation and training of an electrical data logging system for
the 5 electrical utility feeders in the Northport VAMC electrical substation in building
209 located at the Northport VAMC.
B. BACKGROUND:
B.1. Electrical power is fed into the Northport campus via two utility feeds. One from the
Northport (Elwood) feed and the other is from the Indian Head (Pulaski) feed. The
VAMC segregates power from the two substations to five campus electrical feeders.
2 feeders, "B" and "C" are fed from the Indian Head (Pulaski) feed. 3 feeders, "A",
"D" and "E" are fed from the Northport (Elwood) feed.
B.1. The substation is set up so that in the event of a power failure from one of the powerstations, the circuit breakers in the substation can be switched from either open to
closed or closed to open across a main tie breaker, which would allow power from
one substation to traverse the tie breaker and feed the failed side with electricity while
not pushing power back out to the grid. The key here is that the circuit breaker from
the failed side must be open to disallow electricity flow back out onto the grid until
PSEG has corrected the problem and energized the incoming line again. While the
system is currently configured to manually perform this action, new switchgear is in
design to automatically switch the circuit breakers on and off correctly through
another project.
B.2. The future project that will replace the current substation, which is over 40 years old,with an entirely new substation is set to begin sometime in 2016. But to do this,
Northport VAMC's electric utility provider, PSEG needs to tell the VA what type of
protective gear the VA needs to place on the upstream side of the line to make sure
we protect the local electrical feeds that distribute power to the Northport VAMC
campus.
B.3. The data that PSEG and Northport VAMC will need to design the upstream utility
protection and downstream (on-campus) utility distribution requires real-time
electrical data from each of the 5 electrical feeders (A, B, C, D and E). This data
needs to be gathered on each of the three electrical legs in each feeder as electricity is
sent out into the campus.
C. SCOPE:
C.1. GENERAL:
The contractor shall purchase, install and train Northport VAMC personnel on the
Schneider Electric EGX300 Integrated Gateway Server electrical data logger.
C.2. REQUIREMENTS:
C.2.1. One or more data loggers need to be installed to collect data output by the Square D
(Schneider Electric) Series 2000 - Power Logic Circuit Monitors that are residing on
each of the 5 electrical substation feeders (A, B, C, D and E) located in building 209.
The data logger must be seamlessly compatible with Power Logic Circuit Monitors.
C.2.2. The Schneider Electric EGX300 - Integrated Gateway Server is the recommended
data logging unit to use.
C.2.3. The Circuit Monitors located on each electrical feeder shall be serially wired across
the RS485 onboard circuitry. The wires shall pass between electrical cabinet either
through pre-existing open pathway or through installed through-hull electrical
connectors. On the last Circuit monitor, the RS485 wires shall be connected to the
Schneider Electric EGX300.
C.2.4. The Schneider Electric EGX300 shall be mounted on the outside face of the campus
feeder closest to the west door of the substation to allow access to the Ethernet port in
such a way that an Ethernet cable can connect to the EGX300 periodically to
download data.
C.2.5. A 20' Ethernet cable will also be supplied by the contractor.
C.2.6. The contractor will have previous knowledge of Schneider software.
C.2.7. The contractor will provide training to Energy Manager and VA Northport
Electricians on how to retrieve data via Ethernet connection.
PART 2. WORK REQUIREMENTS:
A. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
A.1. POWER LOGIC ETHERNET GATEWAY EGX300:
A.1.1. Installation:
A.1.1.1. Install at least 1 x Power Logic Ethernet Gateway EGX300 on the proximal (closest)
campus electrical feeder. Do not install on the utility feed cabinets labeled
"Northport" or "IndianHead".
A.1.1.2. Connect EGX300 to Square D Power Logic Circuit Monitor via RS485 wires in serial
fashion. Follow Power Logic Ethernet Gatway EGX300 Installation Guide 63230-
319-212A1 directions. Use Belden 8723 or 9842 wiring for serial connections.
A.1.1.3. Access setup menu via Ethernet connection by typing address 169.254.0.10 into
internet interface software (Internet Explorer, Safari, FireFox or Chrome). Setup
logging on EGX300 to acquire data at a minimum of 15 minute intervals. Minimum
logged data must include voltage and current of each campus feeder (A, B, C, D and
E) on 15 minute intervals. Ideally, Northport would like to log the voltage and
current of each leg of wire in each campus feeder on 5 minute intervals.
A.1.1.4. Follow Power Logic Ethernet Gateway EGX300 User's Guide for correct setup.
Document # 63230-319-216A1.
A.1.1.5. Verify EGX300 is properly recording data via Ethernet cable data download into MS Excel format.
A.1.2 Training
Contractor shall train VA Northport energy manager and electricians on data retrieval
PART 3. SUPPORTING INFORMATION:
A. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:
A.1 WORK PERFORMANCE LOCATION:
VAMC Northport
Building 209 - Electrical Substation
76 Middleville Rd.
Northport, NY 11768
B. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:
The Government estimates that the design specified in this Statement of Work shall
be performed within 10 calendar days after receiving the award/ notice to proceed.

C. SECURITY:
C.1. The A/E shall follow all Government rules and regulations regarding information
security to prevent disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals or
organizations.
C.2. VA Handbook 6500.3 defines the procedures for Certification and Accreditation
(C&A) of VA Information Systems. C&A is the process used to ensure information
systems including major Applications (MA) and General Support Systems (GSS)
have effective safeguards which have been implemented, planned for, and
documented in a system security plan as commensurate with potential risks to the
system's information. Since this acquisition will not require services that involve
connection of one or more A/E-owned IT devices (such as a laptop computer or
remote connection from a A/E system) to a VA internal trusted (i.e. non-public)
network, C&A requirements do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package will
not be required.
C.3. A/E staff and management may have access to some privileged and confidential
materials of the United States Government such as budget and strategic plans. These
printed and electronic documents are for internal use only, are not to be copied or
released without permission, and remain the sole property of the United States
Government. Some of these materials may be protected by the Privacy Act of 1974
(revised by PL 93-5791) and Title 18. Unauthorized disclosure of Privacy Act or Title
18 covered materials is a criminal offense.

No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached. These requirements are being refined and detailed as part of the<br />preparation of the IFB.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 25 February 2016<br /><br />- IFB issued (target): April 2016</p>
<p>- Bid Closing (target) : July 2016</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): November 2016</p>

<DESC><p>DLA Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to add 46 national stock numbers (NSNs) on the Bell Boeing (3B1R2) corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9416, a long-term sole source contract which includes multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the Bell Boeing&nbsp;(3B1R2)&nbsp;corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9416, in accordance with the initially approved J&amp;A; however, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The pricing for the national stock numbers will be for option Years 2 and 3 of the contract. The contract expiration date is 09 February 2018. The contract requires a supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB origin and inspection/acceptance at origin to DLA Direct stock locations. A total of 46 NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. It is anticipated that the total 46 NSNs will be priced for the award. The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., CAGE 3B1R2.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites must provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by January 15, 2016. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil).</p>
<p>Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 46 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The Letter RFP issue date is Tuesday, December 15, 2015.&nbsp;The anticipated closing date is Friday, January 15, 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. The definitions from EIA-649-1 apply to items being procured under this solicitation/contract, with the following clarification of Deviation &amp; Waiver:<br />A. Pre-Production RFV (previously known as deviation) requests permission to produce a product that does not conform to contract requirements/documentation for a limited amount of time and for specified effectivity. (A deviation differs from an engineering change in that an approved engineering change requires corresponding revision of the item's current approved configuration documentation, whereas a deviation does not.).<br />B. Post-Production RFV (previously known as waiver) requests approval of product found during manufacture, or after having been submitted for Government inspection or acceptance, that departs from specified requirements, but nevertheless is considered suitable for use "as is" or after repair by an approved method.</p>
<p>3. Contractor responsibilities.<br />A. An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) is used to make permanent changes in the Government technical data package (TDP). Pending approval of an ECP, contractual relief should be requested in writing by the Contractor using a RFV.</p>
<p>B. Refer to FAR Part 48 Value Engineering for cost saving improvements to the Technical Data Package (TDP).</p>
<p>C. All ECPs submitted by the Contractor will be deemed routine. If the Contractor considers an ECP as an emergency or urgent; they shall include in their ECP submittal an explanation and all applicable supporting documentation. All ECPs will be reviewed for a determination on criticality, and, if concurred to be an emergency, the appropriate processing time-frame negotiated with the ESAs will be followed and the Contractor will be notified of anticipated response time.</p>
<p>D. For ECPs, Specification Change Notices (SCNs) or RFV, the Contractor must submit the applicable documentation listed in sub-paragraphs D.(1) through D.(4)to the Administrative Contracting Officer(ACO), with an information copy to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO). Failure to submit a complete legible package may result in return of the ECP/RFV without processing.<br />(1) Documentation listed in Paragraph 3.3.1 (for ECPs), 3.3.2 (RFV), 3.3.3 (for SCNs) or 3.3.4 (for Notices of Revision (NORs)) of the latest revision of EIA-649-1.<br />(2) DD Form 1692 (current revision) for ECP.<br />(3) DD Form 1694 (current revision) for RFV.<br />(4) DD Form 1695 (current revision) for NOR.</p>
<p>4. DLA#s responsibilities:</p>
<p>A. Upon receipt of the ECP or RFV, the PCO will ensure that the applicable product specialist receives the copy from DCMA.</p>
<p>B. Within five (5) working days from the date of receipt of the Contractor's ECP or RFV from DCMA, the PS must submit the requests and any supporting documentation via a 339 to the appropriate Engineering Support Activity (ESA), when applicable.</p>
<p>C. Routine ECPs will be processed within 90 days from receipt by the ESA. RFVs will be evaluated and processed within 30 days from receipt by the ESA or as negotiated with the ESA.<br />(1) The contractor will be notified in writing of approval by the return of an approved copy of the ECP or RFV. Approval will be reflected by signature of the contracting activity or a review activity specifically identified in the contract.<br />(2) The contractor will be notified in writing of disapproval including reason(s) for disapproval.</p>
<p>5. For an approved RFV or an approved ECP, when the request affects the Contract, a modification will be issued to the contract incorporating the applicable requirement changes. Only a Contracting Officer is authorized to issue a modification incorporating the approved RFV and/or ECP.</p>
<p>6. Questions regarding the status of previously submitted ECP or RFV should be directed to the PCO.</p>
<p>7. The submission of an ECP or RFV by the Contractor does not affect the required delivery date of the contract. If a delivery date change is needed, it must be negotiated with the Contracting Officer and documented via modification to the contract.</p>
<p>8. The period of time for evaluation and approval/disapproval of an ECP and/or a RFV, as specified in Paragraph 4. C., shall not constitute excusable delay in the performance of this Contract by the Contractor or in any way relieve the contractor from compliance with the contract delivery schedule. The submission of an ECP and/or RFV by the Contractor shall not preclude the Government from exercising its rights under any clause of the Contract. (End)</p>

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses stating their capability received before 12 Noon on Monday 07 December 2015 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Medalcraft Mint is the only source capable of fulfilling the Governments requirement.
 Medalcraft Mint already has the die, the design of the CNO challenge coin and the signature proof of the current CNO. The die used for the CNO challenge coin is proprietary to Medalcraft Mint and therefore makes it impossible for other mints to fulfill this requirement without the Government incurring additional costs.  All responses may be emailed to Stephen Ngotho at Stephen.ngotho@navy.mil no later than 12 Noon on Monday 07 December 2015.

<DESC>This NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A NON-COMPETITIVE CONTRACT is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15, and the authority for this non-competitive award is 6.302-1. The exception to full and open competition for this procurement is identified in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 &lsquo;Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br />OPM intends to issue a request for proposal to the incumbent contractor for an interim contract for Flexible Spending Accounts with a resulting contract awarded no later than 23 December 2015. This contract will have a base award period of four (4) months with three (3) one month option periods.<br />THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE IS TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF FAR SUBPART 5.2. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responsible parties who identify their interest and capability to satisfy this requirement will be considered. No competitive solicitation will be issued, therefore, any requests for the solicitation will be considered non-responsive. A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is at the sole discretion of the Government. All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities to fulfill this requirement in writing via e-mail to Barbara Hansen, Barbara.Hansen@opm.gov within three (3) days of the published date of this notice. Verification of receipt of electronic transmission is the sole responsibility of the contractor. System for Award Management (SAM) registration is required of all OPM contractors prior to execution of award. If no other viable competitive proposals are received, award will be made to ADP Benefit Services KY.<br />DESCRIPTION OF THIS REQUIREMENT BELOW: <br />This procurement is intended to procure third party administration services for the Federal Flexible Spending Accounts Program (FSAFEDS) to allow OPM to continue offering this benefit to Federal employees on an INTERIM basis. A new competitive contract is anticipated to be complete no later than April/May 2016 and will replace this interim contract.
<p>The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is the Federal Executive Branch Agency with primary responsibility for the Federal Government's human resources management policy and structure. As part of its basic mission, OPM administers the Civil Service Retirement System, Federal Employees Retirement System, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program, and the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program. OPM also exercises a leadership role in the development of new benefit programs for Federal employees. At the direction of the President, OPM implemented a Health Insurance Premium Conversion Plan in October 2000 for approximately 1.6 million Executive Branch employees. OPM also conducted a study of design and pricing options for implementation of medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts (FSAs) across the Executive Branch. These accounts, also referred to as reimbursement accounts, provide tax advantages authorized under the Internal Revenue Code and are widely used by both private and public employers in the United States.</p>
<p>In the years since their development, flexible spending account programs have become an expected benefit that is popular among employees. From the employee's perspective, FSAs offer an attractive opportunity to convert some health care and dependent care expenses from an after-tax expense to a pre-tax expense or to provide for benefits that may not be provided on a pre-tax basis through the employer's benefit program. On benefit attitude surveys for individual employers, the robustness of the employer's health benefit package regularly ranks in the top two or three factors in importance of employee attitudes toward FSAs relative to other benefits.<br />Why is it important for the Federal Government to provide FSAs for likely participants? The demographics of the Federal workforce show that we can anticipate substantial retirements in the next few years. The Federal Government must compete energetically to recruit high-quality workers and to retain gifted and experienced workers. With so many Federal employees eligible to retire by the year 2020, the Government must be able to attract and keep an excellent high performing workforce.<br />Many private and public sector employers have offered FSAs and other pre-tax benefits to their employees for years and now consider health care and dependent care FSAs an integral component in making their benefits packages attractive to both prospective and current employees. Employees who have worked in the private sector or in parts of the public sector have come to expect that FSAs for medical and daycare expenses will be available. The Federal Executive Branch must remain competitive with private employers and state and local governments. Continuing to offer pre-tax spending accounts as a component of the Federal benefits package will help us to recruit and retain the top-performing employees the Government needs.</p>
<p>The current contractor for FSAFEDS is ADP Benefit Services KY.<br />Contracting Office Address: <br />600 Arch Street, Room 3500<br />Philadelphia, PA 19106</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Research and Development Center - Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (ERDC-CRREL) in Hanover, NH requires an extension of its mailroom services contract for the period of 1 April 2016 through 31 July 2016. The current period of performance ends 31 March 2016. These services are on the AbilityOne Procurement List and are performed by a SourceAmerica Non-Profit Agency under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act as a mandatory source of services IAW FAR 8.002(a)(2). Due to delays in acquisition planning, it is anticipated that the follow-on contract will not be executed timely to avoid a lapse in service. Thus, an extension to the current contract is in the best interest of the Government.
<p>ERDC-CRREL intends to execute a modification to the current contract, W913E5-11-P-0038, on a sole-source basis to Northern New England Employment Services in accordance with FAR 13.106(b)(1). The mailroom services at ERDC-CRREL are currently on the AbilityOne Procurement List, which requires ERDC to procure these services through SourceAmerica until and unless SourceAmerica can no longer find a Non-Profit Agency capable of performing the services.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561110 which has a size standard of $7,500,000.00.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement.

<DESC>&nbsp; *Notice: This is a sources sought announcement. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this request. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this synopsis.*
<p>Supporting Documents: Draft Performance Work Statement</p>
<p>Purpose:<br />The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NACIS_ Code is 541512 which has a corresponding Size Standard of 27.5 M. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NACIS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. <br />Background</p>
<p>A requirement exists to establish a Wave Relay Tactical Assault Kit Sustainment Program referred to as WaRTAK. This document, along with the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) describes the capabilities of the WaRTAK System.</p>
<p>WaRTAK is system consisting of one Wave Relay MANET, the ATAK app, and Cisco-based Cloud Relay assembled in a robust, hardened system that shifts the ability for any user to change anything, to a system more resistant to insider threats, user error, and misconfiguration. WaRTAK is focused on pre-defined, essential tasks. <br />WaRTAK is the system arising from the Convoy C3 and Situational Awareness project, a joint effort between Air Force Research Laboratory's Center for Rapid Innovation, the 20th Air Force, and Air Force Global Strike Command started in mid-2013.<br />WaRTAK is a multi-frequency, microwave radio communication system creating a convoy-wide Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) to provide Air Force Security Forces a common operating picture and increased situational awareness. This situational awareness consists of voice/video/data and Global Positioning System (GPS) information being passed between WaRTAK equipment platforms including ground and air vehicles and dismounted security forces personnel. Additional connectivity is obtained with the use of cellular (secondary) and satellite communications (tertiary) connections along the convoy route in areas where line of sight communications are not possible. The System is currently being deployed at 3 missile fields FE Warren AFB, Malmstrom AFB, and Minot AFB involving ~70 personnel, 15-20 vehicles, plus 1-3 UN-1N "Huey" helicopters at each base. The WaRTAK A-Kit consisting of wiring and mounting brackets, is installed on convoy assigned ground and air vehicles. The WaRTAK B-Kit, containing the radio / networking equipment, is likewise mounted both in the ground and air vehicles.</p>
<p>Interested parties should also review the Draft WaRTAK System Performance Work Statement and use the comment resolution matrix to ask questions or make suggestions. The contractor should note that there will be no production related activities associated with this effort.</p>

CFLTP also serves as a contingency, rapid-response language training provider for DoD. This training is provided for authorized personnel and their adult family members, as required for effective performance of their duties in connection with programs of the Department of Defense or other Federal agencies.</p>
<p>Training under this contract is driven by DoD responsibilities and missions. Requirements are driven by world events and the Government's political-military priorities. It should be anticipated that relatively more training will be required in languages native to large numbers of countries than in those spoken as the official language in relatively fewer countries. The Contractor shall provide foreign language training support services and instruction. Typical student load is 200-400 resident students at any given time and 600-700 in the course of a year, but hundreds more are trained under DLIFLC and DLI Washington Office auspices at the Government's facilities elsewhere in the US. Courses range from familiarization courses of a few weeks to basic courses of 26-64 weeks. As part of this contract, approximately 275 - 300 requirements will be competed annually and awarded as task orders.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide resident foreign language instruction at the Contractor's facility within the Washington, DC, metropolitan area and walking distance of metro rail transportation or at Government facilities in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area or elsewhere. Training will be provided to individual students or to small groups generally not exceeding five (5) students. Management, oversight, and infrastructure must be sufficient to support at least 30 full-time individual or small-group classes simultaneously. Vendors must have capability for surge or expansion as needed due to increase requirements with possible heavy concentration in one or a small number of languages.</p>
<p>The Contractor is expected to provide educated native speakers of the standard variant of the target languages, who possess English capability in the 2-range, a facility with learning technologies, including wide use of Internet sources, and the ability to adapt to students with varying learning styles a requiring different learning strategies. The occasional requirement for development of training materials requires personnel with higher-level skills: English proficiency at or approaching level 3; wide experience with the use of the Internet to locate appropriate authentic materials; and computer literacy sufficient to production of web-delivered learning materials. Curriculum development and delivery of training are to be overseen by Contractor personnel with experience and/or credentials in second language acquisition and the utilization of language skills in the performance of U.S. Government and Department of Defense missions. Formative evaluation and academic counseling are required. The Contractor is expected to locate, acquire and compile into coherent curricula such learning materials, including authentic materials, as are necessary to meet the goals of each student. The Contractor is responsible for providing all necessary classroom facilities, including routine access to video and audio materials as well as Internet sources. These premises shall be located in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Additionally, requirements are expected for Mobile Training Team (MTT) instruction on Government installations in CONUS, with general oversight provided by DLIFLC or other DoD onsite training managers. These requirements vary in length from days to months or longer, in level of training from familiarization to professional proficiency, in languages from commonly-taught to those less-commonly-taught but of high national security priority, and in quantity from a single instructor to dozens. Long-distance support and quality control of the instructor corps and their work remains the Contractor's responsibility during the MTT. Curriculum tailored to the specifics of the mission is generally required and is also the responsibility of the Contractor.</p>
<p>The actual level-of-effort (actual number of requirements, classes, students, languages) per fiscal year (FY) is not known at the time of placing the contract and cannot be estimated accurately. Historically, the number of students, languages, and dates of training for each is unknown. In addition to the unpredictability of the required training, there are multiple factors affecting the duration and ability to complete training. Some examples of those factors are changes in the student's mission, changes in DLI-W services which often have to be tailored to address the varying student populations, often requiring one-on-one training or small group training. The one-on-one training and small group training are geared to providing language training to an expected level of proficiency. The trainings will take into consideration the student's previous linguistic knowledge and ability of the student to learn a new language, as well as, refresher training requirements. The language training is often required on short notice, 2 - 6 weeks.</p>
<p>The current Multiple Award IDIQ contracts were awarded on 24 March 2011 as full and open completion with a partial set aside to two or more small business vendors with a period of performance for a base year and four one-year options. The Multiple Award IDIQ contracts were non-commercial T&amp;M contracts and the maximum program value was $96M. Basis of award for the base level contracts were tradeoff and the basis of award for the task orders were lowest priced technically acceptable (LPTA) and tradeoff. Six Multiple Award IDIQ contracts were award. The following three contracts were awarded to small businesses: Dictyon, LLC - W911S0-11-D-0040; International Center for Language Studies, Inc.

<SUBJECT>A--WING INTEGRATION NATIONAL GROUND SYSTEM TEST FACILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<SOLNBR>NNL16ZD3001L
<RESPDATE>012916
<ARCHDATE>11302016
<CONTACT>LaShonda P. Jacobs-Terry, Contracting Officer, Phone 757-864-2359, Fax 757-864-9775, Email Lashonda.P.Jacobs-Terry@nasa.gov

<a href="mailto:Lashonda.P.Jacobs-Terry@nasa.gov">LaShonda P. Jacobs-Terry</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is seeking aeronautics community interest for a state of the art Wing Integration National Ground System (WINGS) test facility for adaptive wing testing under representative aerodynamic loading and induced wing bending. The facility will be achieved by adding to the existing infrastructure in the Combined Loads Test System (COLTS) facility at Langley Research Center, to enable a wide range of test capabilities, from low-Technology Readiness Level (TRL) exploratory testing, to full-scale or nearly full-scale integrated testing for verification, validation, and qualification of these advanced technologies. <p> The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to: 1.	Define aeronautics community interest and use cases for the facility. 2.	Develop facility requirements that will permit testing of a variety of different integrated wing concepts of interest to NASA and the aeronautics community. 3.	Develop a viable design, cost estimate, and notional timeline for future tests, which will be used to develop a white paper describing the potential facility for internal decision making. <p> Information received from the aeronautics community will also be used to determine the need for such a test facility.	NASA envisions the concept of operations for this facility would proceed as described in Attachment 1.  Note that the requirements for the WINGS facility will be derived from an amalgamation of responses received and no specific requirements will be attributed to any responder. Also note that customers to the facility will be expected to pay for utilization of the facility. There is no funding currently allocated for this RFI, and this RFI is not in preparation for any follow on research or facility award. <p> Description of WINGS Facility <p> The WINGS test facility will offer customers who are experts in controls, structures, and sensors a new test capability for aircraft wing structures and control effectors, with hardware and software in the loop. This will be a ground test capability that will allow for the evaluation of full scale multi-functional structures and systems interactions (actuators, sensors, and control algorithms) under representative aerodynamic loading and induced wing bending. The tests are directed at novel and advanced control effectors, such as conventional, distributed, and conformal flaps/control surfaces (both leading and trailing edges). Such a test facility is necessary to evaluate how complex control effectors interact with advanced, flexible wing structures and advanced actuators that do not scale well down to subscale/component testing. <p> A key outcome from the implementation of such a facility is to reduce the risks and increase the TRL of advanced wing technologies for implementation in aircraft and to reduce time spent performing follow-on testing once integrated. This will help to lower the barriers to adoption of new technologies into aircraft designs, hence making the performance gains offered by the technology more attractive to prospective aircraft operators and accelerating the acceptance of these technologies into future aircraft. <p> It is anticipated the facility will allow for the test capabilities described in Attachment 2. <p> Description of Information Requested <p> Responses to this request for information shall include: <p> 1.	Respondent Information: Name of Respondent; Respondents address; Name and contact information for primary Respondent Point of Contact (POC), including POCs name, title (or affiliation with respondent entity), email address, and phone number; and General description of Respondents capabilities and experience in the subject matter of this RFI. <p> 2.	Responses to the following: a.	If NASA were to build an adaptive wing testing facility (WINGS), how interested would you be in testing at the facility? Note that there would be user fees associated with the testing.  Affirmative responses are not binding in either requiring the respondent to test in the WINGS facility, or in requiring NASA to build or provide priority in scheduling access to the WINGS facility.  Instead, these responses will be used to assess the interest in the community for having such a capability developed for future use. b.	Identify potential use cases that you may be interested in testing in the WINGS facility. Please provide a description of the test article(s) and types of tests that may be performed in the WINGS facility. c.	What requirements (forces, displacements, rates, sizes) and special considerations would there be related to any particular use cases identified?  If specific ranges of requirements are enabling for envisioned testing (do not have to be associated with a specific use case), please provide these ranges for consideration in scoping the minimum and maximum capabilities to be integrated into the WINGS facility. d.	Provide feedback on schedule, including possible test durations and usage of the WINGS facility in the first five (5) years of operation starting in the first quarter of calendar year 2018. <p> It is emphasized that this RFI is NOT a Request for Proposal, Quotation, or Invitation for Bid. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3 titled Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual and/or binding agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  The Government may request follow-on discussion with one or more respondents, at the Governments discretion, to obtain clarification or additional detail of the material submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  <p> It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose Respondents proprietary information obtained in response to this RFI. Proprietary and export controlled information should be marked appropriately in your response. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a Respondent as Proprietary or Confidential will be kept confidential. NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN ANY RFI RESPONSE. <p> No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the FedBizOpps and/or NASA Acquisition Internet Service websites. It is the responsibility of any potential offerors/bidders to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. <p> The Point of Contact (POC) for questions regarding this RFI is: Karen Taminger <a href="mailto:karen.m.taminger@nasa.gov">karen.m.taminger@nasa.gov </a> (757) 864-3131 <p> All responses shall be submitted via e-mail to <a href="mailto:karen.m.taminger@nasa.gov">karen.m.taminger@nasa.gov </a>  by close-of-business (COB) January 29, 2016. Files may be submitted in MS Word, PDF, or RTF format. Paper submissions will not be accepted. All responses shall be no more than twenty (20) pages including graphs, charts, tables, illustrations, and other figures. A page is defined as one (1) sheet 8  x 11 inches using a minimum of 12-point font size for text.

<SUBJECT>SOURCES SOUGHT:  Single Frequency, Tunable Ti:Sapphire Laser System
<SOLNBR>AMD-16-SS01
<RESPDATE>121415
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Patrick Staines, Contracting Officer, Phone (301)975-6335, Email patrick.staines@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a single frequency, tunable Ti:Sapphire laser system (including pump laser) to perform research on high brightness ion sources for focused ion beam applications based on laser cooling in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NIST's nanotechnology user facility.
<p><br />NIST requires a single-frequency, tunable Ti:Sapphire laser system capable of high power output (&gt;1 W) at a wavelength of 671 nm. This 671 nm Ti:sapphire laser will be used as part of a cold atom lithium ion source, which will be incorporated into a focused ion beam system for ion microscopy and nanoscale ion implantation. Nanoscale implantation of lithium ions will enable new measurements for battery materials, furthering CNST's mission to develop new measurement technologies for nanotechnology. The unusually short wavelength of 671 nm is required in order to perform laser cooling and trapping of neutral lithium atoms, which is the essential first step of creating a cold atom ion source. The laser needs to be tuned precisely to 671 nm in order to match the 2S-2P laser cooling transition in atomic lithium.<br /><br />Wavelength, tunability, and narrow bandwidth of this laser are also critical because it is necessary to be able to adjust the frequency to match the lithium atomic resonance with parts per billion accuracy. High power is required because the output will be divided into a number of beams for different cooling stages, each requiring enough power to perform effective laser cooling. In addition to providing 671 nm laser light for conventional lithium cooling, this system will also be required to be continuously tunable across a wavelength range of up to 40 nm, so that spectroscopy and laser cooling can be done on other transitions in lithium, and other transitions in other atomic and ionic species can be done on other transitions in lithium, and other transitions in other atomic and ionic species.</p>
<p>After the results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications developed for the single frequency, tunable Ti:Sapphire Laser System, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted will be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334413, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture Ti:Sapphire Laser Systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.</p>
<p>2. Name of company(s) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).</p>
<p>3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to paula.wilkison@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

The E-2C aircraft directs and controls tactical operations for the Naval fleet and coordinates tactical operations with other services in a Joint environment. The systems that provide these functions include the Mission Computer (MC) and the tactical operator workstations. Each AN/ASQ-225 Q-70 Advanced Control Indicator Set (ACIS) tactical workstation is composed of a flat panel display, bullnose assembly, and integrated computer. The bullnose assembly provides operator input to the Q-70 ACIS workstation via an integrated keyboard and trackball. Recent fleet reports indicate the bullnose keyboard keys are popping off and becoming FOD inside the aircraft.</p>

<CONTACT>Tyler Sinclair, Contracting Officer, Phone (703) 875 5481, Email SinclairTE@state.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) <br />Department of State Email Management
<p>1. PURPOSE: This Request for Information (RFI) is issued as market research to determine the capabilities of industry to provide and support a system to satisfy the Presidential Memorandum-Managing Government Records dated November 28, 2011, for managing State Department email by December 31, 2016. This sources sought will also be utilized to determine if any Small Business Set-Aside opportunities exist and how viable GSA schedule and/or existing Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs)  may be for this requirement.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse any costs associated with the preparation of responses. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responses to this RFI will assist DOS in determining the potential level of interest, competition adequacy, and technical capabilities of commercial industry to provide the required products and services. The Government does not guarantee any action beyond this RFI.</p>
<p>The responding party shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing the response.  A decision not to submit a response will not preclude anyone from participating in any future solicitation.</p>
<p><br />2. BACKGROUND: The Department of State is continuing to study options for satisfying Federal requirements for managing email.  The Department is considering acquisition of a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solution as well as modification/customization of existing hardware and software.</p>
<p>The Department has approximately 100,000 email accounts on Sensitive and Classified networks in more than 200 embassies and consulates as well as Washington Main State and other domestic locations.  NARA's Capstone model has been adopted for managing permanent email records.  Temporary email records of most employees and contractors will be maintained for a period of seven years.</p>
<p>The anticipated technical solution will include storage, search, auditing, extraction, disposition, legal holds, de-duping, secure back-up, and related requirements for email records management.  The 2016 target for deployment of the new baseline DoS email management system does not include media other than email, although it is preferred by DoS that the solution be expandable to satisfy the companion 2019 target for maintaining records of other digital media.</p>
<p>A notional diagram of the presumed end-state is included as an attachment to assist vendors in responding to the RFI; however, the diagram is not intended to constrain respondents from describing solutions that differ from this vision.</p>
<p>3. REQUIREMENTS: The Government requires the eventual vendor to provide commercial off-the shelf (COTS) products and associated support services necessary to satisfy the Presidential Memorandum-Managing Government Records dated November 28, 2011, for managing State Department email by December 31, 2016.<br />A.	General Operational Requirements:</p>
<p>The proposed solution should be installed, tested, and fully operational not later than December 2016 to meet the deadline mandated by OMB and NARA:</p>
<p>By December 31, 2016, Federal agencies must manage all email records in an electronic format.  Email records must be retained in an appropriate electronic system that supports records management and litigation requirements (which may include preservation-in-place models), including the capability to identify, retrieve, and retain the records for as long as they are needed.</p>
<p>The proposed solution should anticipate the 2019 requirement for Federal agencies to manage all permanent electronic records in an electronic format - but should not include costs for that solution.</p>
<p>The Department of State processes more than six million emails daily, of which approximately one million are estimated to be unique, after de-duping.  The emails of senior officials (Capstone members) will be permanently retained.  The record emails of other employees will be retained for seven years, subject to NARA's GRS 6.1: Email Managed under a Capstone Approach.   Transitory and personal email will be retained for one year, subject to NARA approval.</p>
<p>The successful technical solution will receive feeds from journaled mailboxes and a dynamic register that identifies Capstone members.  The feeds will be provided from two independent networks: Unclassified and Classified</p>
<p>The solution will satisfy the 62 requirements in the attached Requirements Matrix.<br />B.	Security Requirements:</p>
<p>Clearance: The vendor must possess a facility clearance (FCL) of Top Secret.  The vendor will be required to provide designated contractor personnel with Top Secret personnel security clearances (PCLs) issued by the Defense Security Service (DSS).  All other contractor personnel must favorably pass a Moderate Risk Public Risk (MRPT) determination made by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Department of State prior to contract performance.</p>
<p>Designated contractor personnel assigned to this contract shall possess TOP SECRET and SECRET  personnel security clearances issued by Defense Security Service (DSS) prior to contract performance.

VACHS Radiology Service is looking forward to get better more reliable equipment such as state of the art microwave system in order to increase reliability, decrease mortality and morbidity and to offer state of the art treatments for our veterans.

Description of Service.

In terms of ablation therapies, the radiofrequency were the only available I 0 years ago for treatment of hepatic and renal malignancies, followed by cryotherapy and nowadays microwave technology.
The system must have the capabilities of spherical ablation zone and predictable ablation zone:
Thermal field and wavelength energy controls to avoid adjacent organs and structures injury, all energy should be in-phase for predictability. The system must have different antenna lengths with high visibility under CT or US guidance and internally cooled antenna for maximizing energy penetration.
Warranty will not begin until the day of first successful technical use which must occur after receipt of manuals and user training. On site user training has to be offered before initial use of this equipment. It is highly desirable that the vendor certifies the competency of all users.

1.	Only system on the market with Thermosphere Technology or equivalent components will be considered it must have the following:

a.	Field Control-Design of the antenna to allow a spherical ablation field.

b.	Thermal Control that eliminates heating along the shaft of the antenna (No comet/hot dog shaped ablation zones as well as prevents skin burns).

c.	Wavelength Control-Ability to maintain a spherical ablation field throughout the entire ablation cycle despite changes in tissue impedance or tissue types.

2.	System must work on a 30 cm length antenna

3.	System must offers ex-vivo and in-vivo data in their IFU
 
4.	Thermosphere technology antennas designed to create a spherical ablation zone and the bum on the short axis(s) must be the same as the bum on the long axis.

5.	Antenna must be tune tuned to saline, versus the liver

6.	The system must have a single stick antenna that relies on the active heating zone for ablation vs active & passive zones.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE only.  Responses to this notice will be used for information and planning purposes.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE.  This notice shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Responses to this sources sought is not a request to be added to a prospective bidders list or to receive a copy of the solicitation. 
The Department of Veteran Affairs, Veteran Health Administration, Network Contracting Office, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 15 is conducting market research to identify qualified firms capable of providing community nursing home care services to qualified veterans in the VISN15 area which includes the states of Kansas, Missouri, a portion of Southern Illinois, and small sections of Indiana and Kentucky in the Tri-State area (see map:  http://www.visn15.va.gov/v15/sites cboc map.asp .
NAICS Code 623110 (Nursing Care Facilities) with a small business size standard of $25.5M will be utilized.  Any firm interested in proposals must be licensed by their respective states and must be Medicare/Medicaid qualified. 
Qualified firms would be able to provide community nursing home care services for qualified veterans serviced by VA facilities located throughout the VISN 15 area of responsibility.  The existing VA owned nursing home capacity is extremely limited and insufficient to care for the large veteran population within VISN 15.   In addition, projected number of veterans requiring nursing home care services is expected to increase significantly in the next 20 years due to aging population.  
Resource Utilization Group (RUG) IV rates will be established through negotiations based on the facility's Medicaid rate plus.  Care will be in accordance with the RUG IV case-mix, the industry standard.  RUG-IV defines patients for clinical and reimbursement purposes.  This system utilized information from the Minimum Data Set, Version 3.0 (MDS-3) assessment to classify Skilled Nursing Facility residents into a series of groups representing the resident's relative direct care resource requirement.  Medicaid and Medicare qualified facilities will be required to comply with 42 USC, Â§ 1396R.

Placements will be made in contract facilities based on availability of facilities, veteran health needs, and the desires of the veterans and their respective families.  Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility, the VA uses Basic Order Agreements with no guaranteed minimums.  Suitable community organizations to provide community nursing home care services generally will require:

"	Assessment of need with consideration of relevant veteran population in specific areas and number of existing Agreements already serving those areas.
"	Distance of contract facility from area of consideration.
"	Number of available beds.
"	Nursing Home Compare rating of Average (3 stars) in each of the three areas of review.
"	Current State License
"	Prospective Contractor must have current registration in System For Award Management (SAM).
"	Prospective Contractor must have a current professional liability policy in the amount of $1,000,000 prior to award
"	Prospective Contractor must submit a completed VA Form 10-1170, "Application for Furnishing Long-Term Care" prior to consideration for award.
"	Prospective Contractor must pass a VA exclusion review (fire safety, general safety, and compliance review conducted by VA personnel) prior to award
Offerors having the capabilities necessary to provide the above stated services are invited to provide information to contribute to this Sources Sought notice including commercial market information and company information via e-mail to Grace Windler at grace.windler@va.gov no later than December 26, 2013. Offerors are strongly encouraged to register in the SAM Database at https://www.sam.gov .  Registration in SAM is required prior to award of any Federal contracts.  Please note there is no charge to register in SAM.  Any website requesting payment is not the correct website.
 RESPONSES SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: company name, address, point of contact, phone number, e-mail address and business size/socio-economic classification. Any questions or concerns may also be directed to Grace Windler via e-mail.

1.	Title of Project:	School At Work (SAW) Program

2.	Scope of Work:

School at Work (SAW) is a six month career development system that will be delivered to VISN 19 Facilities using a blended learning system: on-line coursework, DVD classroom sessions, and participant workbooks.
Instructional tools shall be provided by the Contractor.   The Contractor must be a workplace education and e-learning company. During the SAW "Building A Career Ladder in Healthcare" program participants develop a Career and Learning Plan (CLP) that helps them identify and achieve personal career goals through self-assessments and other exercises. Students attend class two hours per week for twenty-two (22) weeks for a total of six months.
The facility conducting a SAW session will have a Coach and Career Advisor provided by each Medical Center. The Coach facilitates the blended learning system committing 4 hours per week (two hours in the classroom, and approximately two hours in the management of the program). The coach serves as a project manager for the SAW class, works closely with internal staff (e.g. student supervisors), keeps attendance records, and monitors the completion of the online components. The coach must have good computer skills, strong communication and facilitation skills, suggested previous experience in education, recruiting, or human resources, and must be familiar with the healthcare organization.

The Career Advisor will meet one-on-one with students throughout the course to help them map out their Career and Learning Plan.  The Career Advisor should meet with each student, one-on-one, 3-4 times during the SAW program.

School at Work provides career development opportunities to employees who are hard-working, committed to a future in healthcare, have potential, but cannot advance
without more education. The focus of School at Work (SAW) is to develop a highly skilled, customer-focused work force that will provide exemplary leadership for the 21st century.

3.	Background:
Currently, VISN 19 has limited opportunities for employees in grades GS-01 thru GS-05 and equivalent Wage Grades. To improve upward mobility, diversity, loyalty, talent, and patient care, those employees that "feel stuck" in entry-level positions need to be provided with new learning opportunities and better chances to succeed. To improve diversity within the organization, and to improve EEO performance, there is a need to have employees learning new tasks, and learning how to develop their skills in order to be successful in their career advancement.
 


The School at Work (SAW) provides learning opportunities to employees in GS-01 thru GS-05 and employees in Wage Grade equivalent. In the School at Work program, employees develop computer skills, math, reading, grammar, writing, medical terminology, principals of patient safety and satisfaction, and organizational skills.

4.	Performance Period:    The SAW Program will be launched within FY 2016. A specific schedule of events will be established by the Facility and VISN DLOs and vendor after contract is awarded.

5.	Type of Contract:   A firm -fixed price contract.

B.	CONTRACT AWARD MEETING
Not required. However, after the contract is awarded, the vendor is required to meet with the VISN DLO to discuss logistics and requirements for the program.

C.	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS/Mandatory Deliverables.  Facilities will have the option to have up to 10 participants; the mandatory deliverables will be up to 10 based on the need of each facility.  
1.	SAW program materials for up to 10 participants (SAW Starter package) per facility, as requested.
2.	Screening Assessment for up to 10 participants per facility, as requested.
3.	Online Program Evaluation survey
4.	Program Certificates of Completion

D.	EVALUATION Criteria:

1.	Past Performance:	Level 4 (organizational impact data, such as # of participants retained, # of participants promoted, # of participants back in school for higher level education, employee satisfaction, etc.)  on SAW program from other government agencies, medical centers or private organizations who have implemented SAW for the past 2-3 years.

2.	Comparative Price from other government agencies, medical centers or private organizations who have implemented SAW

3.	Quality Assurance documentation -documentation of consistency in curriculum delivery; minimal failure in products; minimal process flow defect in product/program implementation; low variability in results from various government agencies, medical centers or private organizations who have implemented SAW.

4.	Technical Capability - ability to provide technical support during implementation of the program.

?
E.	SCHEDULE FOR DELIVERABLES
This is a tentative schedule, to be confirmed after the contract is awarded. The dates may be moved and flexed by the VISN DLO based on other priorities.

1.	Marketing Tools to be provided by end of January 2016
 


2.	SAW Starter Package by end of January 2016
3.	Coach Training in early November 2016
4.	Screening Assessments in January 2016

Daily/weekly/monthly pickup service; storage service, emergency retrieval service; and return of stored material service.

STATEMENT of WORK
OFF-SITE DATA STORAGE
The National Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program is seeking the services of an insured, licensed, and bonded facility or set of facilities for its off-site data storage requirements. The management of the storage facility shall provide certification that its employees have met all necessary security background investigations as a function of employment. The storage facility will also comply with VA Directive 6500 requirement that it will have controlled access, proper environmental controls, and reinforced concrete or steel beam construction that has been earthquake proofed. Access control to the VA information stored at this location will be stringently controlled and periodically tested. Locks and personnel will be used to control the off-site storage to prevent unauthorized access. System and application documentation and an up-to-date hard copy of the contingency plans are also stored securely at this off-site location.  
The successful vendor or vendors shall meet all Federal Requirements enforced by VA's Office of Cyber and Information Security (OCIS) pertaining to storage of sensitive data, and shall not possess within the secured storage area any type of media reading devices in which data can be potentially retrieved from stored media. The contractor or vendors shall store open individually slotted media on shelves and maintain an inventory of media in its possession. All media sent to the location contains bar codes which are tracked by both VA site facilities and inventory kept by secured storage facility.
Awarded vendor or vendors shall issue and track access control ID cards for Government staff, ensuring only those who are duly authorized are able to retrieve media and activate emergency recalls.
Awarded vendor or vendors shall provide the minimum listed required transport containers/totes as listed on appendix A for the site's current media type which each site will provide and a storage tote/container for Disaster Recovery storage (1 per location).   The designated number of container(s) shall be on site at all times for exchange on designated rotation and day listed on appendix A as specified by each location except for the National (CMN) site which requires two. Each container shall hold up a minimum of eighteen (18) tapes apiece.  The one DR container provided per facility will be for holding papers, CDs, tapes, and any other material that might be required by the VA for disaster recovery.  This DR container must be sealable by the VA, and must be stored "AS IS" to be recalled as needed.  The larger DR container will not initially hold other totes inside, but should be deep enough to hold smaller totes if needed.  The vendor shall provide a secure method to tracking stored, in route and recalled media and containers accessible by both the VA and the vendor.
There are nine sites located across the US (Appendix A), each requiring an open individually slotted media storage program. Each site has designated a day of the week/month as the scheduled pickup and delivery day.  The product being transported from each facility will consist of backup media and/or Disaster Recovery information.  Each facility will have two different types of storage requirements, one open slotted media program for backup media which shall be picked up on the designated schedule and shall need to be cataloged and inventoried at stored location.  The second will be for a Disaster Recovery Container which shall be a stored on shelf as a secure closed container with no return date and will be recalled by facility as needed.
It is possible for the volume and type of tapes to increase or decrease over time for any or all of the facilities but a minimum of one container shall be at each location at all times.  Every week, when a transport container with backup media is collected from a site, the vendor shall also be delivering the replacement containers and any recalled or scheduled backup media requested by the site.
Each site will conduct a minimum quarterly recall of media to test their backup and restoration procedures. The recall will be conducted separately from the regularly scheduled weekly pickups with the date and time to be determined by the site.   Included in the quarterly recall of media will be the Disaster Recovery Container.
The VA has stablished a max storage period of 4 weeks per media (except for the Disaster Recovery Container) at which it will be automatically returned to the original site for recycle/reuse during the normal pickup schedule.


PHASE IN PERIOD
A phase-in period may be needed to convert operations from the incumbent vendor to the successor. Vendor(s) receiving this award(s) shall be required to provide support for future phase-in-period between the incumbent vendor and the successor. The effective date of the contract resulting from this solicitation shall be forty-five (45) calendar days (or sooner upon mutual agreement) for the phase in period after the date of award. Vendor(s) shall ensure that sufficient manpower is available during the conversion (see FAR 52.237-3 Continuity of Service).
TRANSFER OF SERVICES
In the event a site relocates, the vendor (s) receiving the award(s) may have reduced workload during the transition. The estimated transition time shall be thirty (30) calendar days. Contractor shall ensure that sufficient manpower is available during the transition (see FAR 52.237-3 Continuity of Service).
RETRIEVAL SERVICES
Upon a retrieval request by the VA site, the vendor shall respond to the request and provide the requested media within 4 hours.   The VA is required to test the retrieval services once a quarter and the vendor shall include this charge as part of the initial cost of this service.

B3.	Contractor Personnel Security
The contractor and his/her personnel shall wear visible identification at all times while he/she is on the premises.
The Contractor shall maintain physical security at all facilities housing the activities under this SOW, including any subcontractor facilities.  
All contractor employees who require access to the Department of Veterans Affairs' computer systems shall be the subject of a background investigation and must receive a favorable adjudication from the VA Security and Investigations Center (07C).  This requirement is applicable to all subcontractor personnel requiring the same access.  If the security clearance investigation is not completed prior to the start date of the contract, the employee may work on the contract while the security clearance is being processed, but the contractor will be responsible for the actions of those individuals they provide to perform work for the VA. 
Background Investigation
All contractor employees who require access to the Department of Veterans Affairs' computer systems shall be the subject of a background investigation and must receive a favorable adjudication from the VA Security and Investigations Center (07C).  This requirement is applicable to all subcontractor personnel requiring the same access.  If the security clearance investigation is not completed prior to the start date of the contract, the employee may work on the contract while the security clearance is being processed, but the contractor will be responsible for the actions of those individuals they provide to perform work for the VA. 
1.  Background Investigation
The position sensitivity for this effort has been designated as Low Risk and the level of background investigation is a National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI). 
2.  Contractor Responsibilities 
a. The contractor shall bear the expense of obtaining background investigations.  If the investigation is conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) through the VA, the contractor shall reimburse the VA within 30 days. 
b. Background investigations from investigating agencies other than OPM are permitted if the agencies possess an OPM and Defense Security Service certification.  The Vendor Cage Code number must be provided to the Security and Investigations Center (07C), which will verify the information and advise the contracting officer whether access to the computer systems can be authorized.

The level and process of background security investigations for Contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the Contractor/Subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 
6.	If VA determines that the Contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the Contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 
7.	If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated Business Associate Agreement (BAA) must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.

b.	Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.
c.	Outsourcing (Contractor facility, Contractor equipment or Contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the Contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (Government facility or Government equipment) Contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.
d.	The Contractor/Subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The Contractor/Subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the Government. Contractor/Subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with Contractor/Subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, and Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.
e.	The Contractor/Subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COR. The Government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using Government personnel or another Contractor/Subcontractor. The Contractor/Subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.
f.	VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or Contractor/Subcontractor owned equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for Government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.

g.	All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the Contractor/Subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the Contractor/Subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the Contractors/Subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to VA for sanitization or destruction or the Contractor/Subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.
h.	Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
1)	Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
2)	VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
3)	VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
4)	Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for VA to retain the hard drive, then;
a)	The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
b)	Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.
c)	A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
B7.	SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

a.	The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The Contractor/Subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the Contractor/Subcontractor has access.

b.	To the extent known by the Contractor/Subcontractor, the Contractor/Subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the Contractor/Subcontractor considers relevant.
c.	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
d.	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the Contractor/Subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The Contractor, its employees, and its Subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The Contractor/Subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
B8.	LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

a.	Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the Contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the Contractor/Subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
b.	The Contractor/Subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
c.	Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
1)	Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
2)	Description of the event, including:
a)	date of occurrence;
b)	data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
3)	Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
4)	Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
5)	Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
6)	Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
7)	The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
8)	Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
9)	Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
10)	Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
11)	Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

d.	Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the Contractor shall be responsible for paying to VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
1)	Notification;
2)	One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
3)	Data breach analysis;
4)	Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
5)	One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
6)	Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

B9.	SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the Contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the Government, the Contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a Government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The Government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time. 
B10.	TRAINING
a.	All Contractor employees and Subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
1)	Successfully complete the VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior course (TMS #10176) and annually complete this required privacy and security training; Sign and acknowledge (electronically through TMS #10176) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix D relating to access to VA information and information systems.
2)	Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.] 
b.	The Contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.
c.	Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and electronically sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

<DESC><br />The Library of Congress (LOC) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed-price contract to Goodwill Industries (Goodwill) to procure Janitorial services for its facility at the Fort Meade army base in Maryland. The Library intends to award the contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1; Goodwill is the only source capable of satisfying the Library's requirement.
<p>A current contract between LOC and Goodwill expires on December 14, 2015. The sole source contract will be a short-term Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) four-month base contract running from December 15, 2015 to April 14, 2016, with two (2), two-month option periods; 1st option period running from April 15, 2016 to June 14, 2016 and 2nd option period running from June 15, 2016 through August 14, 2016.</p>
<p>Through the proposed short-term contract, Goodwill Industries will continue to perform Janitorial services for the Library's Fort Meade Campus to prevent a break in the provision of services while the facility is added to the AbilityOne procurement list. 41 United States Code, Chapter 85 mandates that the contract must be awarded to an AbilityOne Company. Awarding the contract will enable the Library to ensure consistent maintenance of a clean, safe and sanitary environment at the facility. The facility is the Library's offsite archival storage; it includes high-efficiency, high-storage-capacity designed modular storage modules that house books, print and visual collection materials, office spaces, a warehouse, collection storage bays and cold vaults. The facility is a high-technological infrastructure that requires certain expertise for cleaning the cold storage areas. The incumbent contractor's staff are specially trained to conduct the Janitorial services for the cold storage areas. A break in the provision of Janitorial services at the facility will result in the buildings becoming unsanitary and potentially unsafe.</p>
<p>This notice is for informational purposes only and not a request for quotation. No solicitation document is available, and telephone, fax or email requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is within the discretion of the Library.</p>

<p>Compact devices that can perform rapid and complex analysis on minute biological samples with minimal reagents are appealing for both field and benchtop applications. Sample preparation for such devices, however, remains a critical challenge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For successful analysis of clinical and environmental samples, pre-processing is most often performed on the benchtop and entails mostly manual, time-consuming and labor intensive techniques. The coming together of the scaling advantages inherent in microtechnology, with the need to speed up, automate, and integrate sample preparation and analysis, has led to intense effort in the development of microfluidic platforms for a variety of tasks, from particle filtration, cell sorting and separation, to surface-based assays and purification of biological analytes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Concurrently with the tremendous proliferation of microfluidic technologies over the last 20 years, rapid progress has been made in adapting ultrasound for sample manipulation in sub-millimeter-scale fluidic networks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Acoustofluidic approaches combine non-contact handling of fluid-suspended particles with the potential for high-throughput continuous processing.</p>
<p>Using these principles, LLNL has developed a fast, continuous-flow separation device for automated sample processing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A high-throughput, flow-through viral enrichment technology such as this acoustofluidic device can be advantageous for reducing hands-on time while enriching for the viral content of samples such as serum (clinical), wastewater (industrial), and sea-water (environmental) for subsequent analysis. Recently, LLNL scientists reported high-throughput separation of particles and T lymphocytes by altering net sonic velocity to reposition acoustic pressure nodes in a simple two-channel device, further described below.</p>

<p>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. The Corps of Engineers Mobile District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (having an anticipated contract value exceeding $25 million) within the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL and surrounding area. This market survey is being posted for the Project Number DBEH 06-3000, Range Communications Facility, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL.  Description of Work:  Design-Construction of a new, state of the art, multi-level facility to accommodate modern communications equipment. 3,216 Square Meters, rated to withstand a Category 3 hurricane, constructed in accordance with Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 1-200-01.

An above ground vaulted fuel tank is required for this project. This project will comply with DoD antiterrorism/force protection requirements per UFC 4-010-01. Demolish 1,656 SM.  Includes lead paint and asbestos removal.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Accordingly, Offerors are requested to respond to this Special Notice regarding PLA with the following information.</p>
<p>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL and surrounding area?</p>
<p>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?</p>
<p>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?</p>
<p>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?</p>
<p>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?</p>
<p>(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a<br />Mobile Engineer District contract?</p>
<p>(8) Please provide a list of recent (2-5 years) construction projects in the local labor market of the project under consideration. Include the following items:</p>
<p>Project Name/Location	Project Description	Initial Cost Est/Actual Final Cost	Was the project completed on time	Number of craft trades present on the project	PLA (Y/N)	Were there any challenges experienced during the project?<br />1.						<br />2.</p>
<p>(9)Which trades are expected to be employed on this project? Are you likely to need some union skilled trades for at least part of this project?</p>
<p>(10) What market share does union labor have in the geographic area for this project or type of construction?</p>
<p>(11) Does the local market contain the sufficient number of available skilled workers for this project? Are there other projects in the vicinity going to limit the pool of skill labor available for your project?</p>
<p>(12) Has a project like this been done before in the local market?</p>
<p>(13) What investments have been made to support registered apprenticeship programs?</p>
<p>(14) Have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by the public sector in this geographic region? Have PLAs been used on this type of project in other regions?</p>
<p>(15) Which CBAs are likely to expire during the course of the project under consideration that might cause delays?</p>
<p>(16) How do open shop and union wage rates influence prevailing wage rates in the local market and compare to Davis Bacon rates? What impact does unionization in the local market have on wages?</p>
<p>(17) Could a PLA contribute to cost savings in any of the following ways?<br /> -Harmonization of shifts and holidays between the trades to cut labor costs?<br /> -Minimization disruptions that may arise due to expiration of CBA?<br /> -Availability of trained, registered apprentices, efficient for highly skilled workforce?<br /> -Allowing for changes in apprentice to journeyman ration.<br />-Serving as management tool that ensure highly skilled workers from multiple trades are coordinated in the most efficient way.<br />-Others?</p>
<p>(18) Could a PLA minimize risk and contribute to greater efficiency in any of the following ways?<br /> -Mechanisms to avoid delays<br /> -Complying with Davis Bacon and other labor standards, safety rules and EEO and OFCP laws.<br />-Ensuring a steady supply of skilled labor in markets with low supply or high competition for workers.</p>
<p>(19) Are there ways in which a PLA might increase costs on this particular project?</p>
<p>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Special Notice no later than December 15, 2015 2 PM CST.  E-mail your response kyle.m.rodgers@usace.army.mil. This Special Notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of IV Start Kits. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MW-1209-49_IV_Start_Kits are eligible for participation. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These IV Start Kits products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the subject QSL. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is January 2016. Among vendors who are on the IV Start Kit QSL, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on IV Start Kits.<br /><br /></strong>A. Products &amp; Performance Required.<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of IV Start Kits. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $2,303,824.00 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period.

Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO West via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br /></span>The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO.

Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted.  A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points of Contact (POCs):</span><br />Ms. Cheryl Anne Janus, RN, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.a.janus.ctr@mail.mil,(619) 532-7554; Ricardo U.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<CONTACT>BRENT M DEPAUW, Phone 3097828031, Email brent.m.depauw.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Below is a list of all questions submitted in response to the W560MUY-16-R-0001 synopsis posting and draft pws:
<p>QUESTION 1: Has a contractor performed similar work to this for the government in the past? If available, please provide the incumbent contract number.<br />ANSWER: DynCorp International LLC is currently performing similar services under contracts W560MY-15-C-0005 and W560MY-15-C-0006.</p>
<p>QUESTION 2: It appears that the requirements contained in this PWS are very similar to those of the PWS for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) Advisors for the Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Ministry of Interior (MoI) Dated: 17 Jul 2014 and the PWS for the Functional Area Support Teams (FAST) Dated 24 Oct 2015. All three requirements call for provision of expert advisors and assistants to build organizational capacity and capability across various functional areas of the MoI, and or MoD. The first call out five functional areas needing focused attention and the later three. This instant requirement calls for eight functional areas in need of capacity building. Will there be measures in place to mitigate duplication of efforts? Is this last effort designed to bundle and combine the other two, thus eliminating those contracts in the coming years?<br />ANSWER: This effort is not a duplication and the Government has methods in place to not duplicate efforts.</p>
<p>QUESTION 3: This solicitation is listed as Set aside - N/A- Will this effort remain unrestricted or does the government intend to change the competition level to Small Business set aside via future amendments?<br />ANSWER: There are currently no set asides for this requirement.</p>
<p>QUESTION 4: EF-6 - states, "Plan, resource and execute effective security campaigns and operations: inter-ministerial and joint coordination; and command, control and employ ground, air and special operating forces." If the effort in unrestricted would any small business firms proposing for this effort be virtually eliminated by the magnitude of this task?<br />ANSWER: There are currently no set asides for this requirement.</p>
<p>QUESTION 5: Paragraph 1.16.12 states, "(ODCs exclude the following items (list not all inclusive) - subcontractor labor, security clearances, employee training, any program management cost, pre-employment drug screening, any class 1 (food/water), individual comfort items, fringe cost (H&amp;W, Worker's Comp, Etc) and or passenger cars)".Are these costs to be included within proposed CLIN values as appropriate? Would any require itemization through the invoicing process?<br />ANSWER: ODC's will be set up as a cost reimbursable CLIN with no fee. If any of the listed excluded items are valid, they should be included within the proposed CLIN values as appropriate.</p>
<p>QUESTION 6: Part 5, Paragraph 5.3.2 Advisor, Payroll (US Advisors), Subparagraph 5.3.2.1. Duties, state, "The contractor shall advise and mentor ANDSF and ASI officials on the following topics:</p>
<p>- Fully pay all their employees accurately, timely and in a secure fashion.<br />- Implement electronic pay system (EPS) within MoD and MoI.<br />- Increase Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to include entire workforce.<br />- Manage payroll budget and execution through AHRIMS and according to Tashkil and Pay scales.<br />Will the potential contractor be tasked to create and design databases and web-based capabilities to interface systems such as AHRIMS and EPS? <br />ANSWER: The contractor will not be tasked to create and design databases or web-based capabilities to interface with any system. The contractor will only be involved with the actual business process flow design that will be given to the Netlinks contractor for actual system and database design. AHRIMS will be replaced by the Afghanistan Personnel and Payroll System (APPS).</p>
<p><br />QUESTION 7: The PWS describes the AHRIMS to have many "software errors". Furthermore, the PWS states that " [t]he implementation of AHRIMS would cause the practice of ghost soldiers to be curtailed - at least partially..." This leads us to believe that the contractor will be responsible for the further implementation of AHRIMS. For this effort, is it expected that the contractor provide software development / database development services in terms of the AHRIMS? Does the contractor need to have in-depth knowledge of the current AHRIMS architecture? If so, does the Government intend to release any technical documents for the AHRIMS?<br />ANSWER: The contractor will not be responsible for further implementation of AHRIMS but will be responsible for providing reporting requirements to Afghan counterparts needed from AHRIMS/APPS systems and instructions on how to pull reports to find necessary data within the system to answer questions such as "Who is eligible for re-contracting?" etc. They will not be performing software development.</p>
<p>QUESTION 8: Does the Government intend to include FFP quotes from contractors for the Safe House CLIN in the RFP?<br />ANSWER: Yes, a FFP CLIN will be established, and prices will be proposed for Safe Houses to house individuals by range (ie 0-25 individuals, 26-50 individuals) on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>QUESTION 9: Will the Safe House quotes be part of the total evaluated price for the LPTA determination?<br />ANSWER: Yes.</p>
<p>QUESTION 10: Will the contractor have a role in providing security for contractor personnel individuals that are working at sites throughout the country? Is the contractor required to provide its own security at the Safe House and for travel from the safe house to the work location? Is so, it is expected that a PSC1 certification will be required to support this contract.<br />ANSWER: Normally the Government will provide security for advisors as they travel with Government personnel from government offices to sites. The Contractor is required to provide its own security at Safe House(s) and for travel between Safe House(s) and work location.</p>
<p>QUESTION 11: Does Technical Exhibit 6 show the current staffing on the contract or a projected staffing level for the first year of the new contract? Please clarify. Will the Government provide the current staffing level of the contract by labor category and the projected staffing level by labor category for each of the next 5 years?<br />ANSWER: Technical Exhibit 6 shows the estimated staffing levels at time of award. Actual staffing will be ordered on an IDIQ basis.</p>
<p>QUESTION 12: Does the Government have an established lead time for notifying the contractor of a surge requirement or a downsizing requirement? Are contractor response times negotiated on an action-by-action basis or is there an expectation that the contractor will have a bench of personnel and will be able to staff up to a surge level that will be established by the RFP?<br />ANSWER: The Government does not expect the contractor to have a bench of personnel. Expected lead time is 45 days and will be written into the PWS.</p>
<p>QUESTION 13: Draft PWS paragraph 3.1.3 states: "It is anticipated that all Contractor employees will be housed aboard coalition or U.S. installations. If such billeting is not available, then the USG will provide appropriate reimbursement for safe houses for contractors working this contract." If contractors may be required to provide their own life support services, this will not only involve costs associated with safe houses, but other supporting functions as well, including movement security and transportation (which in turn will depend on requirements the Government imposes on the location of the safe houses, proximity to work locations, etc.). Given the uncertain availability of Government-provided billeting, can the Government confirm that offerors will be required to submit with their proposals comprehensive life support solutions including safe houses and other supporting functions? And if so, can the Government more clearly delineate which life support functions specifically offerors may be required to provide under this contract (and hence will be required to price in their proposals)?<br />ANSWER: If Government billeting and life support services are unavailable, the contractor will be expected to provide, and this cost will be part of the buildup of the safehouses.</p>
<p>QUESTION 14: Draft PWS paragraph 1.3 states: "The objective for this effort is for the contractor to advise, mentor, train, and provide expertise to ANDSF and ASI personnel in order to improve and sustain specific governmental processes and systems across the eight (8) Essential Functions (EF) using and indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract." Can the Government confirm that its intent is to issue a single-award IDIQ contract in response to this procurement?<br />ANSWER: Yes the intent is to issue a single award IDIQ contract.</p>
<p>QUESTION 15: "The Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN) for personnel will be cost reimbursable based upon a fully-burdened firm fixed unit price per person, per day." Can the Government please verify that its intention is to require the contractor to bill the required number of units on a fixed unit price basis? If so, what is the Government's planned methodology for verifying the quantity of units for billing purposes?<br />ANSWER: The intent is for the contractor to propose a fully burdened daily rate for each labor category. The contractor will then invoice for each day the employee is "boots on ground" working the requirement. The contractor will not be allowed to invoice for an individual during hiring, mobilization, demobilization, and R&amp;R as they won't be considered "boots on ground" working the requirement. The contractor shall invoice monthly, and the quantity will be verified by each requirement owner (example the employee reported for duty December 11 and worked the remaining days, thus invoicing for 21 days (Dec 11 - Dec 31).</p>
<p>QUESTION 16: Draft PWS paragraph 1.6.1.1 states "In the event the Contractor's personnel performance is unsatisfactory, the Government reserves the right to request and receive satisfactory replacement. The Contractor shall be responsible for identifying a suitable replacement within 15 days of notification. A replacement shall be in theater, performing services at the specified place of performance no later than 35 days after a position becomes vacant." However, meeting the final Secret clearance requirements, completing CRC, and traveling into theatre will be incredibly difficult to achieve within 35 days. Will the Government accordingly consider extending this requirement from 35 to 60 days? In addition, can the Government confirm that this replacement requirement is only applicable in cases in which the removal of personnel would lower the offeror's staffing levels to below the 85% staffing requirement stated in Draft PWS paragraph 1.6.3.1?<br />ANSWER: The Government will consider increasing the number of days from 35 to 60, however the intent is to always be staffed at 100%, as the contractor can only invoice the number of labor positions they provide and are "boots on ground". The 85% minimum staffing level is to protect the Government, and if staffing levels drop below 85%, the Government would consider asking the contractor for consideration.</p>
<p>QUESTION 17: Draft PWS paragraph 3.1.1.15 states: "Pre-deployment training and processing at the designated CONUS Replacement Center (CRC). Currently the designated CRC is located at Fort Bliss, TX." If an offeror has a DoD-approved CRC, can it use its CRC in lieu of using the Ft. Bliss CRC?<br />ANSWER: Yes</p>
<p>QUESTION 18: Draft PWS Paragraph 1.6.12 contains a list of possible ODCs and associated categories, but it appears to be incomplete. Can the Government provide a more comprehensive list of ODCs offerors will be required to purchase under this contract? Will the Contractor be expected to propose against the list of ODCs?<br />ANSWER: Since ODC's are unknown, and can vary depending on future requirements, for evaluation purposes ODC's will be calculated using the same flat amount filled in for each offeror.</p>
<p>QUESTION 19: Will there be property management requirements, such as an approved property management system?<br />ANSWER: Yes</p>
<p>QUESTION 20: Will there be any subcontract consent requirements?<br />ANSWER: No.</p>
<p>QUESTION 21: How many billets for offeror PMO personnel is the Government planning on allocating for this contract?<br />ANSWER: Currently the only PMO requirement which will be invoiced separately are the three Key positions (Program Manager, Security Manager, and OCONUS Site Lead) all other PMO positions shall be fully burdened with each labor rate to meet the requirement of the PWS.</p>
<p>QUESTION 22: Will the USG please clarify if award on this contract will create an OCI with performance on other ANDSF contracts, namely W56HZV-15-R-0139 [i.e., NMS-A]?<br />ANSWER: An OCI mitigation plan will be one of the requirements for submission by each offeror.</p>
<p>QUESTION 23: During pre-deployment mobilization contractors are not considered to be "on the contract." TE 1, PRS#1 mandates an 85% fill rate on all positions. Is this fill rate "boots on the ground?" Please confirm that personnel processing CRC for mobilization and those on R&amp;R leave would not count towards the fill rate.<br />ANSWER: Correct contract employees are not considered to be on contract till "boots on ground".</p>
<p>QUESTION 24: Does the government anticipate a left-seat/right-seat handover from incumbent contract to awardee should the incumbent be unseated by the award or does this paragraph reflect that the government envisions a train-up period conducted by the government?<br />ANSWER: The Government anticipates a left-seat/right-seat handover from the incumbent contractor along with training from the Government.</p>
<p>QUESTION 25: Para 1.6.9.3, Personnel - This paragraph requires contractors to comply with "the standards of conduct." Does this refer to paragraph 1.7 "Personnel Conduct".<br />ANSWER: Yes</p>
<p>QUESTION 26: How does the government intend for offerors to capture the costs for administration and testing relating to establishment and enforcement of "an aggressive substance abuse screening program at all sites" (random periodic and 100% bi-yearly testing)?<br />ANSWER: All labor rates should be fully burdened with applicable cost.</p>
<p>QUESTION 27: For which positions on the program will the government require resumes and/or letters of commitment in offerors proposals?<br />ANSWER: Key Personnel</p>
<p>QUESTION 28: Regarding the potential lack of availability of housing on coalition or U.S. installations that would trigger the contractor to secure a safe house for their employees working on this contract, what is meant by "appropriate reimbursement?"<br />ANSWER: The current plan is for each offeror to submit pricing on a monthly basis for safehouse's for a category of individuals (example 1-25 individuals, 26-50 individuals, 51-75 individuals, etc). If coalition housing is unavailable, the US Government will request the contractor to provide safehousing IAW set standard for the required # of personnel, and the contractor will invoice accordingly monthly.</p>
<p>QUESTION 29: If commercial air between the "theater gateway" (Kuwait?) is used due to immigration issues (entry stamps in passports) created by entering/departing Afghanistan at military airfields, will the government allow mail shipment of government furnished equipment issued to individuals at CRC? If so, how will contractor bill for this? Would the government consider allowing for shipment of individual gear issued at CRC to be a reimbursable expense?<br />ANSWER: See Question 29. Most equipment is already available in theater. If this is an issue, the Government would consider this to be and ODC reimbursable cost that would have to be pre-approved.</p>
<p>QUESTION 30: Are there currently enough weapons, body armor and ammunition currently assigned to incumbent contractor personnel to equip the contractor staff for the follow on award? If so, will the COR facilitate a handover of this equipment and will it become GFP? If not, how will contractors get this equipment into theater? Will a storage facility that the contract is to secure and manage be provided by the government in theater? Since body armor can be issued at CRC and shipped along with other CRC issued equipment via USPS, would the government consider making this a reimbursable expense?<br />ANSWER: Yes there are currently enough weapons, body armor and ammunition assigned to incumbent to equip the new contractor staff for the follow on award. Yes the COR will facilitate the handover of this equipment and it will become GFP.</p>
<p>QUESTION 31: Para 5.6.3.3, Essential Qualifications - The final bullet of this paragraph states that the CSTC-A CDD Force Management Advisors "must deploy with a weapon (US or NATO pistol, rifle, or both)." This contradicts para 3.2.2 which states that it is currently "not legally possible for contractors to deploy into theater and immigrate into Afghanistan carrying their body armor, weapons, and ammunition." Is Para 5.6.3.3 incorrect? Will these advisers need to link up with their weapons in theater as is the case with other armed contractors on this contract?<br />ANSWER: Para 5.6.3.3 is incorrect and will be revised. Also See answer to question 29.</p>
<p>QUESTION 32: Para 5.6.2.3, Essential Qualifications - This paragraph ends with the statement, "the contractor shall provide advisors working in this section with the following additional essential qualifications...". However, no additional qualifications are listed. Were additional qualifications unintentionally omitted?<br />ANSWER: 5.6.2.3 reads as follows:</p>
<p>5.6.2.3. Essential Qualifications. In addition to the basic qualifications listed in paragraph 5.2, the contractor shall provide advisors working in this section with the following additional essential qualifications:</p>
<p>- Former military officer (O-5+) or NCO (E-8+) with division or higher staff experience.<br />- Six or more years HR experience with exposure to HR database management.<br />- Prior supervisory experience required.<br />- Demonstrated organizational and analytical skills.<br />- Ability to effectively communicate, advise, and train others in principles of the associated staff functions.<br />- Driver's qualification, including the ability to operate manual transmission vehicles.<br />- Must be armed to perform this work and meet all requirements for arming.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION 33: The requirements as outlined in each of the labor categories for advisors/mentors only specify that four positions must be armed. These are in EF 4 (HR Advisor, AHRIMS Advisor, CSTC-A CDD Force Management Advisor) and EF 8 (ANDSF Travel Planner). Can all positions be armed? Is this left up to the contractor's discretion? Will an example of a complete arming package (the paperwork necessary to be submitted for arming authorization) and process for arming authorizations be provided to the contractor?<br />ANSWER: The contractor may arm all personnel. However, Arming will be in accordance with "USFOR-A FRAGO 15-032 ARMING PROCEDURES FOR DOD CONTRACTORS" The government will provide examples.</p>
<p>QUESTION 34: The skill levels for the "Lead" and "Head" translators are identical as are those of the "Translators." Was it the government's intent for the skill levels of the Lead and Head translators to be identical?<br />ANSWER: The skill levels for "Lead" and "Head" translators are the same (Level 1). However, the skill levels of the Lead/Head translators are higher than translators (Level 2). The Government will update paragraph 5.6.7 and 5.6.21 titles so they match.</p>
<p>QUESTION 35: Would the government verify that duty descriptions, skill levels and the number of FTEs will match data in Technical Exhibit 6?<br />ANSWER: Technical Exhibit 6 shows the estimated staffing levels at time of award. Actual staffing will be ordered on an IDIQ basis.</p>
<p>QUESTION 36: The clearance requirements specified in the basic requirements for the Senior Advisor and Advisor are final Secret clearances finalized prior to departure from the U.S. However in the three of the EF 4 positions (Training Advisor, Logistics Training Advisor, and ICT Training Advisor) the requirements only require an interim Secret clearance which can be finalized once the contractor is in theater. Additionally, the EF 8 position, Security Assistance Sr. Advisor requires that the individual be eligible for TS/SCI clearance. However, the DD 254 for this contract only authorizes Secret clearances to be held. Would the government consider upgrading the DD 254 to allow offerors to hold TS/SCI clearances/access? Can you also clarify whether an interim Secret clearance is acceptable for the other three positions?<br />ANSWER: EF 4 positions require final secret clearances and PWS will be updated to reflect that. The Government will leave the DD 254 as is at the Secret Level.</p>
<p>QUESTION 37: Will the government consider providing passport control on the coalition base in order to mitigate the lack of entry stamps on current contractors who arrive via MilAir?<br />ANSWER: If immigration processing is available at time of contract award, the government will consider providing passport control.</p>
<p>QUESTION 38: Current contractors are working on RS and HKIA, which requires RS badges. Will the government confirm that all these positions are CE Billets at RS?<br />ANSWER: RS badges are available to contractors with security clearances. Contractor personnel are coded as Contractor Billets.</p>
<p>QUESTION 39: Section 3.1.13 states that contractors will receive, when necessary, resuscitative care. Will USG provide routine or emergency Medical Care? Will the USG provide Medical Evacuation when needed?<br />ANSWER: The Government will only provide emergency medical care. The Government will provide medical evacuation when needed.</p>
<p>QUESTION 40: In technical exhibit 6, please define the requirements for "Nonspecific" positions.<br />ANSWER: These positions are ones that technically do no fall under any specific EF or may span multiple EFs. These positions include: 5.10.1, 5.10.2.1, 5.10.2.2, 5.10.2.3 and 5.10.2.4</p>
<p>QUESTION 41: Para 5.3.6.3, Essential Qualifications - Will the Government specify what language is required in this section? Will the government clarify what is meant by Level 6 proficiency?<br />ANSWER: Dari. It should read Level 1 (requirements specified in paragraph 5.6.7), not level 6. PWS will be updated.</p>
<p>QUESTION 42: Regarding Safe Houses: Section 1.1 holds contractor responsible for all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tool and materials. Section 1.6.5 discusses Safe House Costs. Request government estimate provide the number of safe houses that may be required. Would the government also clarify who is responsible for safety, acquisition of the facility, life support services, and transportation for those who are required to stay in safe houses?<br />ANSWER: The contractor is responsible for acquiring safe houses and maintaining all safety, transportation, life support and security requirements. The Government cannot estimate the number of safe houses as it depends on the capacity of the contractor selected safe houses.</p>
<p>QUESTION 43: Will employees who are "rebadging" from the outgoing contractor to the incoming contractor be required to attend CRC again?<br />ANSWER: No.</p>
<p>QUESTION 44: Must all personnel hired be approved by the USG?<br />ANSWER: No, only "Key Positions" - all others must meet minimum qualifications for their position.</p>
<p>QUESTION 45: If no facilities exist for Government provided food and essentials, is there a mechanism for reimbursement/per diem?<br />ANSWER: Government provided meals are provided at most locations. See question 12. Also see PWS paragraph 1.6.12.</p>
<p>QUESTION 46: As the scope of work of increased, can the Government confirm it has merged requirements from more than one contract and if so can the contract number and incumbent(s) information be provided? Also is the end customer the same for these requirements or is this now a multi-agency opportunity?<br />ANSWER: You may be confusing this requirement with other requirements for similar services. The scope of this requirement has not changes and the current contractor and contracts is listed in question #1.</p>
<p>QUESTION 47: DPWS 1.3 references an IDIQ type contract. Will there be a single winner or multiple winners and what type of contract will the task orders be? 1.6.5 mentions a hybrid type contract but is unclear as to whether or not this will apply to all task orders.<br />ANSWER: The intent is to issue a single award IDIQ type contract with a hybrid of CLINs consisting of Firm Fixed Unit Price (FFUP), and Cost Reimbursable with no fee.</p>
<p>QUESTION 48: Technical Exhibit 3 denotes hours by position type but does not address what the work week will entail- Sunday to Thursday? Also, the reference under 1.6.3.2 talks about "recognized" holidays. Can a list of these holidays for both US and Afghan personnel be provided?<br />ANSWER: The work week may differ between PWS sections and positions to ensure coverage. However, generally the work week consists of one day per week off. The Afghan holidays vary from year to year.</p>
<p>QUESTION 49: What are the nationality requirements (if any) for the 96 IT type positions?<br />ANSWER: See PWS paragraphs 5.6.7 and 5.6.8.</p>
<p>QUESTION 50: The number of ex-patriate personnel has increased considerably under the DPWS. Can the Government explain the reasoning behind the increase of ex-pat personnel and provide the rationale for why these positions are not able to be filled by local national staff?<br />ANSWER: This is the first release of the PWS, thus the requirement hasn't increased or decreased. The Government is under the assumption you have been comparing this to another requirement.</p>
<p>QUESTION 51: Previous Q&amp;A indicated that this requirement would not be an OCI with performance on other ANDSF contracts but given the increase and change of scope can the Government confirm this is still the case?<br />ANSWER: This is the first Q&amp;A concerning this requirement, however an OCI plan will be required by all bidders.</p>
<p>QUESTION 52: Can Technical Exhibit 5/Attachment 8 be provided as 1.6.6.4 requires physical security to the detail provided is insufficient in determining what physical security will be necessary?<br />ANSWER: Technical Exhibit 5 (Government Furnished Property) will be released with the solicitation.</p>
<p>QUESTION 53: Does the response to the previous addressed question 24 still apply?<br />ANSWER: Again this is the first Q&amp;A regarding this requirement.</p>
<p>QUESTION 54: Can the Government confirm whether AHRIMS is currently being used or not? The PWS talks about previous implementation but also discusses a requirement for implementation. Also, does the system require overhaul or evaluation?<br />ANSWER: AHRIMS is currently in use. There is a separate initiative/contract to merge AHRIMS, EPS and enhance some capabilities. Any system changes will be accomplished by other contracts already in place and not by these contractor personnel.</p>
<p>QUESTION 55: Is there a system currently being used for the PPBE process and if so can more information be provided?<br />ANSWER: In fiscal year 2015 the Ministry of Defense (MoD) produced a budget based on a prioritized 1 to N list of all program requirements for the entire Afghan National Defense Security Force (ANDSF) constrained to a top line provided by the coalition for the first time ever. This historic achievement was made possible through the development and enforcement of financial processes by the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A), CJ8, Program and Analysis (PandA) team. These processes along with the MOD budget produced will ensure the Planning, Programming, Budget, and Execution (PPBE) process will endure. PandA successfully Trained, Advised and Assisted (TAA) the MoD Program and Analysis team execute 8 integrated Joint Coordination Councils and one General Officer Steering Committee (GOSC), that brought international donors, coalition, MoD and Afghan representatives together for the first time to review the combined draft $4.1B MoD budget and provide the ministries with their first look at "off" budget funded requirements. Further, over the course of summer 2015, PandA mentored the MoD Program, Analysis and Evaluation Division in their creation of a 99 percent correct Final Programming Position for the Ministry's Budget Circular-2 submission and 12 MoD budgetary units/budget builders to collaborate and develop an internally generated 1-N prioritized list of the Ministry budget's requirements. PandA also lobbied and secured successful buy-in from MoD and Coalition General Officers to accomplish the first ever integrated Senior Leader Steering Committee in support of the Afghan SY1395 budget build resulting in consensus from all parties on the MoD Final Programming Positions. This body of work ultimately resulted in the Afghan Budget Circular-2 submission to the Ministry of Finance and will serve as the basis for the coalition commitment to ANDSF (Commitment Letter) and will serve as the basis of the POM17-21 build. PandA also served as the as a primary contributor and driving force for the Center for Naval Analyses' portion of the ANDSF Plan of Record (APoR) by providing cost data support for their independent analysis of the ANDSF; PandA further drafted key sections of the USFOR-A response to the Joint Staff in support of this effort. Finally, PandA initiated a major overhaul of the CJ8 Requirements Database containing over $35B of ANDSF requirements by rewriting code and updating standard operating procedures to add anti-tamper safeguards thereby significantly reducing the potential for internal and external user errors.</p>

<p>QUESTION 56: Section 1.7.2 outlines employees/personal weapons information. Is it a requirement for personnel to carry weapons and if so does this apply to all positions?<br />ANSWER: Personnel are required to carry weapons who occupy PWS positions that have this requirement. Also see question 31.</p>

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>The Government will award a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: _price/cost, delivery, past performance, and tecnical capability_ of the item offered to meet the Government requirement. All evaluation factors other than Price, when combined, are _equally_ as important as price. <BR> <BR>

?
5. The following questions were submitted in response to this RFP; the Government's "Answers" are provided below:
QUESTIONS	ANSWERS
Roll Over Orders:  Would you please clarify how you would like to enter as unit price and amount?  Will the order roll over every month? Or it will roll over throughout the year?  
	Orders will roll over month to month within each year of the contract.  The monthly estimates are each VAMC's "best estimate" of workload to inform vendors of an expected number of orders; however to ensure VAMCs get all the orders that they pay for (i.e., if we're paying for 1500 orders a month, and only use 1400 orders, the remaining 100 orders for that specific VAMC will roll over to the next month giving 1500 + 100 = 1600 total orders paid for).  As workload varies, this was thought to be the most equitable solution.  Each year is handled separately; the rolled over orders will reset annually. (Page 13)  
Is there a pricing expectation for roll over order?
	There are potential for overage charges, but if sites are able to bank unused orders and roll them over monthly, then those additional fees are significantly less likely in later months each contract year.  Price accordingly.
For Wilkes-Barre VAMC, it stated has both inpatient and outpatient coverage.  The based fee includes up to 1500 orders per month.  I would like to clarify the following:

1.	1500 orders are for inpatient orders per month only? 
2.	If 1500 orders are just for inpatient order, what is the estimate outpatient order workload per month?
3.	 If outpatient orders are separate, where should I enter the price per unit order for outpatient?
4.	Outpatient orders consider as CMOP orders, IMO orders, or ER orders?
	1.	Yes, 1500 orders a month are for inpatient only.

2.	The estimate amount of outpatient orders per month is 19,700.

3.	The updated schedule for Wilkes-Barre VAMC is included with the answers to questions found in Amendment A00001.

4.	Outpatient orders would be prescription orders entered into the outpatient package only (no IMO, no ER) with the routing of MAIL.  There is a VistA option called Complete Orders from OERR which allows a pharmacist to select outpatient pending prescription orders by routing.  The Contractor's pharmacist would select by MAIL routing and would be able to process orders out of this queue. 
The bid lists 7 VA Centers.  Please confirm that the pharmacy must service ALL 7 centers.  And if that is the case, does the pharmacy have to be licensed in all states where the centers are located?
	The awarded Contractor must service all 7 medical centers.  A pharmacist license in good standing from any state would be required for contract pharmacists, but pharmacists would not have to be licensed in each state served.  As VHA pharmacists are Federal and Contractors provide services within the VHA system, specific state licensure requirements are not applicable. 
The instrument provided (D.3 THE PAST PERFORMANCE SURVEY) for the pharmacy to provide references, doesn't appear to have an area for the referring party to identify the Pharmacy.  How would you like the Pharmacy to be identified?
	All emails that I have received with surveys have identified the surveyed Pharmacy in the subject line of the email, and the sender has signature blocks.  This method works for me and I can continue to separate according to the current practice.  Any additional information that is necessary to identify, as far as whom the survey is from or for can be annotated by the signature block of the survey.

The VA in Wilkes-Barre lists inpatient as well as outpatient needs.  Does the 1500 orders per month estimate include both inpatient and outpatient orders?	1500 orders are for inpatient.  There will be 19,700 estimated outpatient orders per month.

6. The HOUR and DATE proposals are due remains unchanged at December 11, 2015; 12:00 P.M. E.S.T.
7. Offerors are reminded "Failure to acknowledge receipt of this amendment may result in rejection of your offer.

<p><strong>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />Provide a complete price list for the following food &amp; beverage requirements. These requirements are an estimate and we will select items from the catering menu provided.</p>
<p>**Each day, most of our participants will eat lunch in the hotel restaurant or off-site. Many do choose to eat in the hotel restaurant, so please staff the restaurant accordingly from Tuesday to Thursday. In addition to those participants eating in the restaurant or off-site, we have several working meetings scheduled throughout our event with 8-30 participants each. For these instances, we would like to offer participants the ability to order self-pay meals beforehand that will be delivered or picked up by participants. If lunches are to be picked up by participants, we will need several pay stations operating to ensure that working lunch meeting participants can pay for lunches quickly and have ample time to meet. We have typically offered box lunches with a pre-order form. The pre-order form contains five options or a menu that varies each day. Participants can order in advance and turn their form in by 9:30 or 10:00 am so that the kitchen can prepare orders. A combination of salads and sandwiches with sides work well for our group.</p>

Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, has a requirement to purchase a mobile eye tracking system. Procurement of this system will support the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) in their mission to reduce and prevent rail accidents.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT5716Q80039 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-83, effective November 01, 2015. The NAICS Code is 333314; the Small Business size standard is 500 Employees. This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK - Begin <br /><br />Introduction/Background<br />The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, issues this Statement of Work (SOW) in support of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) in their mission to reduce and prevent rail accidents. The purpose of this request is for the Volpe Center to acquire an eye tracking system to collect driver gaze information while operating a simulated locomotive. This system will include recordings of eye movements, driver scan and search patterns in a three-dimensional space in which the driver's head may rotate. The system will be primarily used in the FRA's Cab Technology Integration Laboratory (CTIL) rail simulator, but may be used in the field during future experiments.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The central deliverable to the government is the supply and installation of a tool which tracks subject gaze locations in a 3d, multi-surface environment and the requisite tools for analysing its data and isolating it based on specific areas of interest. The Government also requires that the hardware allows for extensive subject mobility. The reasoning for this is twofold. Firstly, the simulator in which it will be installed is reconfigurable, and it is essential that the eye tracker can function without repositioning of equipment. Secondly, subjects are likely to be wearing any eye tracker headgear for periods of over an hour, and this is why the Government needs an untethered light system.<br /><br />Period of Performance<br /><br />The Contractor shall deliver and configure all components and provide any necessary training within sixty (60) days from the date of the award.<br />Place of Performance<br />The Contractor shall provide on-site installation, demonstration and any training at the Volpe Center in Cambridge, MA, in the FRA's Cab Technology Integration Laboratory (CTIL). <br /><br />Requirements<br /><br />In meeting the Volpe Center's minimum requirements, the system shall:<br />1. Have head mounted optics which are lightweight (less than seventy grams).<br />2. Maintain accuracy while the subject is wearing corrective lenses, including bifocals and progressive bifocals.<br />3. Work with a wide array of eyeglass frame designs, or provide vision correction so that subjects' glasses could potentially be removed while wearing the device.<br />4. Function in both light and dark-light conditions.<br />5. Function for more than four hours, if the device requires batteries.<br />6. Include a second battery, if the device requires the use of a battery.<br />7. Integrate into a Government-procured rail simulator and be transferable to other simulators or field vehicles.<br />8. Function "untethered." That is, provide for free motion of subject's head, and extensive subject mobility without being directly attached to a laptop or larger device.<br />9. Resolve and record position of handheld devices or clipboard.<br />10. Have a short setup/calibration time (&lt;2 minutes) and calibrate using five or fewer calibration points.<br />11. Receive a TTL signal from an external source and either include a column in the output showing the signal state, or use the signal as a marker in the data file. This signal will be used to align the eye tracker's data with other data sources from the simulator.<br />12. Be capable of subject data recalibration after collection, and use the new calibration for analysis.<br />13. Allow for repair without replacing the entire unit.<br />14. Have analysis tools which reduce the raw eye tracking data to fixations.<br />15. Have analysis tools which automate gaze data analysis to avoid relying on frame-by-frame analysis.<br />16. Have analysis tools which automatically identify eye fixation locations based on researcher-defined areas of interest.<br />17. Be capable of producing accurate data without a separate head-tracking system.<br />18. Function in an environment that is comprised mostly of aluminium and steel.<br />19. Be configured by the contractor to operate with remote oversight in a room adjacent to where the subject is wearing the equipment (the Government will provide a computer for this function).<br />20. Be supported by the contractor for a period of at least a year.<br />21. Have components that maintain a temperature below 105 degrees if they come into contact with the subject's face or head.<br /><br />Acceptance Criteria<br /><br />The Government will consider the Contractors work complete when the system has been installed onsite, configured to work properly, and the system has been demonstrated to two Volpe Center employees (both to learn how to operate the system and to ensure that it meets the Requirements). Demonstration will include calibration in light and dark environments (as well as with various types of glasses), data recording while subject's head is moving, any requisite gaze mapping, data reduction and simulator timing.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The USAID/OTI Somalia program will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government to promote stability and political transition, and counter violent extremism, in Somalia. The new program will focus on providing assistance to communities newly liberated from the al-Shabaab militant group, providing support to newly-formed regional administrations, and assisting other emergent political priorities related to the Vision 2016 agenda laid out by the international community and the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS).  In close coordination with the State Department representatives, other USAID programs, other U.S. Government actors, UN stakeholders, other donors, and the FGS, and with consideration of U.S. Government priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners to complement broader stabilization efforts and foster positive political change.<br /> <br />The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Africa Team Leader based in DC, while also having dual reporting to the leadership of the USAID Field Office for Somalia. The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be the strategy development, design, oversight and management of OTI's Somalia program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, local government officials, and local beneficiaries.<br /> <br />This post is an senior management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. The Country Representative should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantee and contractor/USAID relationships. The candidate should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, U.S. Government agencies, and international organization officials. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.</p>
<p>Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including stabilization, counterinsurgency, community-driven development, elections, subnational governance, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, and human rights. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. Willingness to work alongside military colleagues (both U.S. and non-U.S.) is essential. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments. Experience in remote project management is highly desirable, as this position is Nairobi-based yet will be overseeing a localized program in Somalia.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.

<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on the implementing partner's performance, budget, and appropriateness of scope in achieving OTI's country objectives, presenting modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract in accordance with USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>This announcement was previously posted under solicitation number <strong>W91CRB-15-R-0047</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">This announcement is not a request for proposals. Contractors shall not submit proposals in response to this notice.<br /><br />Generation II Advanced Bomb Suit (GEN II ABS) - for PEO Soldier</p>
<p>Proposed Solicitation Number: W91CRB-16-R-0002</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground is issuing this pre-solicitation notice to announce the intent to issue a solicitation for the GEN II ABS.</p>
<p>Estimated Solicitation Issue Date: On or before&nbsp;16&nbsp;December 2015 with all documents, attachments and amendments posted at the FedBizOpps website located at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov. No hard copies of the RFP will be issued. All respondents shall be responsible for obtaining the documentation from the website listed above.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure this requirement on an unrestricted, full and open procurement using procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 315990 Apparel Accessories and Other Apparel Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), in support of Program Executive Office - Soldier (PEO Soldier), Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) has a requirement for Gen II ABS systems. The current Advanced Bomb Suit (ABS) ensemble, consisting of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) 8 bomb suit and EOD 9 Gen 2 helmet, is too heavy/bulky, restricts mobility and dexterity, and has limited sizing for full body protection and efficient utilization for US Army EOD Soldiers. Further, the current ABS lacks an effective integrated cooling system capability.</p>
<p>In response to the constantly changing and increased threats encountered, the Army has identified a need to improve and redesign the ABS ensemble to provide not only a higher level of protection, but also to improve the mobility and capability of the EOD Soldier. The Army will be seeking improvements to the helmet and suit of the ABS as a system and, individually. Further it is important to highlight that the Generation II Advanced Bomb Suit (Gen II ABS) is a Non-Developmental Item (NDI), which asks Industry to propose existing, complete designs that are either in production or waiting for a requirement to begin production.</p>
<p>The US Army intends to place the best available Non-Developmental GEN II ABS in the hands of the Warfighter as quickly as possible. The Solicitation will use Best Value with Price Tradeoff were Soldiers feedback is significantly more important than price. Industry designs with no Government design participation will be exclusively evaluated for this program. Executed in two phases, Evaluation (Phase 1) and Production (Phase 2), this solicitation will support the evaluation of multiple designs and allow Soldiers to select the highest rated system to receive FAT approval.</p>
<p>Phase 2 Production will be executed as a requirements contract with an estimated initial quantity of 153 (10% of the ABS Army Acquisition Objective) systems and estimated maximum quantity of 1,538 (full AAO) systems.</p>
<p>A reduction in weight, improved sizing tariff, and integrated cooling capability are the focus of this improvement effort. The number one objective of the Gen II ABS is to reduce weight while improving form, fit, and function. To achieve this, new ballistic, fragmentation, and blast protection materials offer the potential for significant weight reduction while providing the same level of protection or better. Further, the Army is seeking an expanded sizing tariff for the helmet and suit to improve the fit and function for each EOD Soldier. Finally, the Army is seeking to leverage dramatic improvements in cooling system technology by incorporating an enhanced integrated cooling system into the suit.</p>
<p>Based upon these requirements, the following improvements are proposed as they have potential to provide immediate impact for EOD Soldiers:</p>
<p>&bull; Weight: The weight and weight distribution of the ABS ensemble must not significantly impede mission efficiency. The current ABS weighs 74 pounds for a size medium. The objective for the GEN II ABS is to reduce the weight of the current ABS by approximately 15% to 40%</p>
<p>&bull; Size: A lack of proper sizing increases the ABS' system weight issue. Currently there are only four sizes for the ABS suit (small, medium-small, medium and large) and a single helmet with a series of adjustment pads to fit the full sizing tariff. Updated anthropometric data on the US Army Soldier population indicates the need for new sizing. Specifically the Gen II ABS shall be designed to accommodate the full range of user personnel, i.e., 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male for full body protection and efficient utilization by EOD Soldiers.</p>
<p>&bull; Improved Cooling System. EOD technicians require an integrated cooling system to keep core body temperatures within normal range in hot environments. Prolonged exposure to high physical output and temperatures rapidly degrades the operator's ability to effectively perform their duties. The current ABS cooling system is not integrated (adds time to don/doff) and is dependent upon readily available ice in order to provide temperature cooling inside of the bomb suit. Both of these inherent design characteristics make the system unfavorable for Soldiers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Information</span>:</p>
<p>Offerors shall be able to deliver one (1) medium Gen II ABS end item with all components with ballistic test data from an NIJ certified lab within sixty (60) calendar days AFTER release of solicitation.</p>
<p>The Gen II ABS system, in any of its configurations, is considered a critical safety item (CSI). All items being procured under this acquisition are subject to the Buy American Act and Berry Amendment.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding up three (3) FFP contracts, one contract per system design under Phase One, and one (1) FFP Requirements contract with a four (4) year ordering period under Phase Two. Awards will be made to the best overall proposals (Best Value), which are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 02: The purpose of this amendment (Amendment No. 02) is to extend the proposal due date from 30 November 2015 to 2 December 2015.  The due date is being extended due to issues with DARPA's BAA (proposal submission) Website experienced by proposers on 30 November 2015 that prevented proposal submissions from being completed.  Those proposers who successfully submitted through DARPA's BAA (proposal submission) Website prior to the 30 November 2015 due date are not required to resubmit their proposals as a result of this extension.  However, those proposers who did successfully submit through DARPA's BAA (proposal submission) Website prior to the 30 November 2015 due date may, if they choose, resubmit their proposals - but the resubmitted proposal must very clearly note that it is being submitted in place of a previous submission.  See the changes highlighted in yellow in the attached DARPA-BAA-16-03 document through amendment 02.

<DESC>Reference Sources Sought Notice that was posted under Reference Number HHS-NIH-ORF-SBSS-16-001, this pre-solicitation notice provides information with regards to the Office of Research Facilities (ORF), NIH intent to issue a solicitation to Louviere, Stratton and Yokel LLC (LSY) for Post Design Architectural and Engineering Services to renovate Building 10, F-Wing and NIH Bethesda, Maryland
<p>Task Order #HHSN20200099, Contract #HHSN263999900297I will expire December 31, 2015 and the IDIQ Contract remaining ceiling will not allow ORF to extend the services without increasing the IDIQ Contract ceiling. ORF has elected to pursue this A&amp;E requirement as a new award under FAR 6.302-1 authority.<br /><br /><strong>This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all inquiries received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /></strong><br />THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH'S (NIH) OFFICE OF RESEARCH FACILITIES (ORF) INTENDS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACT TO LOUVIERE, STRATTON AND YOKEL LLC (LSY) TO PERFORM POST DESIGN A/E SERVICES (INCLUSIVE OF COMMISSIONING) IN SUPPORT OF THE BUILDING 10 F-WING RENOVATION PROJECT, BETHESDA, MD.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Background:<br /></span><br />The world's largest clinical research hospital is a complex of buildings on the NIH campus known as Building 10 or the Clinical Center Complex (CCC). While over the years the CCC has expanded from its original 1951 structure to encompass important additions, portions of the original Building 10 facility are no longer capable of supporting modern research. The building infrastructure is undersized, exceeded its useful life, and must be replaced with current state-of-the-art equipment to provide sufficient and reliable support for research.</p>
<p>For these reasons, in 2009, ORF acquired the services of an A/E of Record to prepare 100% construction documents necessary for the complete renovation of the F-Wing of Building 10 (floors 2 through 14). Due to the partial, continued occupancy of the North Corridor portions of floors 6 through 13 the project was designed to be accomplished in two phases.<br /><br />The construction was awarded in July 2010 and consists of a 5-year Base period (Phase A) and one 5-year Option period (Phase B): the Option period was exercised concurrently with the Base period.</p>
<p>Phase A consists of:<br /><br />a. The conversion of approximately 64,000 GSF of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 2 through 5 to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas and to install new utilities infrastructure; the infrastructure work will support the renovation of the entire F-Wing and will include the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 4 and 14. <br /><br />b. Phase A also includes installation of mechanical equipment on the 14th floor and treatment tanks on floor B-1 and related alterations/piping on floors 1 and B-2.<br />Phase B consists of:<br /><br />c. The conversion of approximately 151,600 GSF of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 6 through 13 to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas; work includes the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 9, 13, and 14. <br /><br />d. Phase B also includes fit-out of north corridor areas of floors 2 through 5 not constructed in Phase A.<br /><br />Currently, the Phase A and Phase B Construction is behind schedule; completion is anticipated in 2016.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of the Requirement:<br /></span><br />The Government is seeking a qualified A/E firm capable of providing A/E of Record Post Design &amp; Commissioning Services to coincide with the completion of the F-Wing Renovation construction performance period, with additional time beyond the construction allowed for preparation of As-Built Record Documents and Commissioning Post Construction Warranty periods. <br /><br />The period of performance for A/E Post Design &amp; Commissioning services, inclusive of warranty period(s), is anticipated through the end of calendar year 2016. <br /><br />If awarded, the A/E firm shall assume the responsibilities and liabilities of the A/E of Record, inclusive of any redesign services resulting from errors and omissions, at no cost to the Government. <br /><br />The A/E services shall be performed by qualified personnel who shall have proven knowledge of this type of construction and competence in construction and observation. <br /><br />The services are to be performed in a timely and expeditious manner and shall principally consist of the following tasks: <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TASK 1 - A/E POST DESIGN SERVICES <br /></span><br />General and normal A/E Post Design Services will be required throughout execution of the construction project and shall principally consist of the following activities: <br /><br />1.1.

<DESC>The response date has been changed to 12/03/15 @12 Noon EST (Philadelphia).

The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses stating their capability received before 12 Noon on Thursday 03 December 2015 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Medalcraft Mint is the only source capable of fulfilling the Governments requirement.
 Medalcraft Mint already has the die, the design of the CNO challenge coin and the signature proof of the current CNO. The die used for the CNO challenge coin is proprietary to Medalcraft Mint and therefore makes it impossible for other mints to fulfill this requirement without the Government incurring additional costs.  All responses may be emailed to Stephen Ngotho at Stephen.ngotho@navy.mil no later than 12 Noon on Thursday 03 December 2015 EST.

<p>THIS IS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT SURVEY ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. The Corps of Engineers Mobile District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (having an anticipated contract value exceeding $25 million) within the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL and surrounding area. This market survey is being posted for the Project Number DBEH 06-3000, Range Communications Facility, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL. Description of Work: Design-Construction of a new, state of the art, multi-level facility to accommodate modern communications equipment. 3,216 Square Meters, rated to withstand a Category 3 hurricane, constructed in accordance with Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 1-200-01.

An above ground vaulted fuel tank is required for this project. This project will comply with DoD antiterrorism/force protection requirements per UFC 4-010-01. Demolish 1,656 SM. Includes lead paint and asbestos removal.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Accordingly, Offerors are requested to respond to this Special Notice regarding PLA with the following information.</p>
<p>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL and surrounding area?</p>
<p>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?</p>
<p>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?</p>
<p>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?</p>
<p>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?</p>
<p>(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a<br />Mobile Engineer District contract?</p>
<p>(8) Please provide a list of recent (2-5 years) construction projects in the local labor market of the project under consideration. Include the following items:</p>
<p>Project Name/Location Project Description Initial Cost Est/Actual Final Cost Was the project completed on time Number of craft trades present on the project PLA (Y/N) Were there any challenges experienced during the project?<br />1. <br />2.</p>
<p>(9)Which trades are expected to be employed on this project? Are you likely to need some union skilled trades for at least part of this project?</p>
<p>(10) What market share does union labor have in the geographic area for this project or type of construction?</p>
<p>(11) Does the local market contain the sufficient number of available skilled workers for this project? Are there other projects in the vicinity going to limit the pool of skill labor available for your project?</p>
<p>(12) Has a project like this been done before in the local market?</p>
<p>(13) What investments have been made to support registered apprenticeship programs?</p>
<p>(14) Have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by the public sector in this geographic region? Have PLAs been used on this type of project in other regions?</p>
<p>(15) Which CBAs are likely to expire during the course of the project under consideration that might cause delays?</p>
<p>(16) How do open shop and union wage rates influence prevailing wage rates in the local market and compare to Davis Bacon rates? What impact does unionization in the local market have on wages?</p>
<p>(17) Could a PLA contribute to cost savings in any of the following ways?<br />-Harmonization of shifts and holidays between the trades to cut labor costs?<br />-Minimization disruptions that may arise due to expiration of CBA?<br />-Availability of trained, registered apprentices, efficient for highly skilled workforce?<br />-Allowing for changes in apprentice to journeyman ration.<br />-Serving as management tool that ensure highly skilled workers from multiple trades are coordinated in the most efficient way.<br />-Others?</p>
<p>(18) Could a PLA minimize risk and contribute to greater efficiency in any of the following ways?<br />-Mechanisms to avoid delays<br />-Complying with Davis Bacon and other labor standards, safety rules and EEO and OFCP laws.<br />-Ensuring a steady supply of skilled labor in markets with low supply or high competition for workers.</p>
<p>(19) Are there ways in which a PLA might increase costs on this particular project?</p>
<p>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Special Notice no later than December 15, 2015 2 PM CST. E-mail your response <a href="mailto:Jason.J.Dalton@usace.army.mil">Jason.J.Dalton@usace.army.mil</a>.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified businesses interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The Government will utilize this information in determining an acquisition strategy. This is not a Request for Proposal nor a synopsis of a proposed contract action under far subpart 5.2. <br /><br />Scope of Work:<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, is seeking interested business sources for a design-build project for rehabilitation of the protective steel liner in the 9-foot tunnel at Mud Mountain Dam in Enumclaw, Washington. Mud Mountain Dam is a flood control dam situated on the White River in Western Washington State. Downstream of Mud Mountain Dam, the White River enters the greater Tacoma metropolitan area which is a densely populated area in Western Washington State requiring protection from potential floods. <br /><br />Mud Mountain Dam was designed taking into consideration probable silt and rock bed loads. Two tunnels were constructed: a partially armored 9-foot tunnel to pass water with bed load, and a largely unarmored 23-foot tunnel to pass primarily water. As a result of damage from abrasion and cavitation, holes have formed in the current steel liner armoring the 9-foot tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual length of the tunnel is approximately 1800 feet. Formulation, design, and construction of a new liner is required to rehabilitate and maintain the structural integrity of the tunnel.<br /><br />The proposed project will be Firm-Fixed Price and will require various engineering disciplines for design and construction completion. In addition, the project will require planning and phasing during construction to minimize impact to flood control operations at Mud Mountain Dam. Contractor personnel will be required to work in a constrictive and damp environment.<br /><br />The project duration is an estimated 1095 days. <br /><br />The magnitude of construction is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.<br /><br />USACE Seattle is seeking capability packages to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications. The type of solicitation issued will depend upon the responses to this notice. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with information provided in response to this notice, or for any follow up information requests. Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. <br /><br />Under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 15% of the contract work with his/her own employees.<br /><br />Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under this notice.<br /><br />Responses to this notice shall be limited to 5 pages and include the following information:<br /><br />1. Company name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.<br />2. Company's interest in proposing on the solicitation if/when issued.<br />3. Description of the company's capability and experience relative to the work described in the above scope of work. Identify Three (3) to five (5) examples of comparable projects. Projects should include (at a minimum):<br />a. A description of the project<br />b. Dollar value<br />c. Project duration/date completed<br />d. Customer name<br />4. CAGE code and DUNS, if applicable<br />5. Company's current construction bonding limits (singular and aggregate)<br />6.

<AWARDEE>Palmer Federal Constructors, Inc., 360 MERRIMACK ST BLDG 9, Lawrence, MA 01843-1403 US
<DESC>This project consists of construction of a flood risk management project around a residential neighborhood located adjacent to the Blackwater River tidal estuary in Salisbury, Massachusetts. The project site consists of an existing residential development of about 20 acres that includes approximately 135 homes located on 9th Street, 10th Street, 11th Street, 12th Street, Humphrey Avenue, Lewis Avenue, Florence Avenue, and Carter Street. Roadways within the project footprint are flooded as often as 1-2 times per month, and flooding to low lying homes is commonplace. The project consists primarily of a 3,000 linear foot vinyl sheet pile floodwall that will surround the project site and be built to elevation 7.7' NAVD88. The project will be constructed on private property within a neighborhood setting.
<p>All required easements will be obtained by the Non-Federal sponsor prior to start of construction. Other project features include upgraded storm drain lines, concrete sidewalk, granite curb, one underground 26 CFS pumping station, one back-up 100kW power generator located in a to be constructed elevated utility building with gas and electricity connections, drainage improvements (to include 9 outlet structures, 11 catchbasins, storm drains, trench drains, water quality inlet, etc), a stone lined channel, paving (to include repaving and new pavement), site work (including excavation in the marsh, gravel fill on the landside of the wall, grading, etc.), and plantings. In order to minimize impacts to the adjacent salt marsh, construction work required to be performed in the wetland shall be completed only during the non-growing season of 1 November through 31 March, inclusive, of any year Construction mats will be used in the salt marsh to further minimize impacts.</p>
