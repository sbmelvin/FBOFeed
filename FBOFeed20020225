This will be accomplished through analyses of survey and crash investigation data within the Partners For Child Passenger Safety surveillance system, and conducting research that clarifies or extends findings from the surveillance system.  Two (2) types of research activities will be covered under this requirement:  1)selected analyses of survey and crash investigation data contained in the Partners surveillance system; and  2)qualitative research studies that provide context and interpretation to the surveillance system findings, or provide information for intervention strategies related to the surveillance system findings. Interested parties shall demonstrate their capabilities to perform the requirement as specified.  Expressions of interest without sufficient detail to permit evaluation of one's ability to accomplish the requirement will not be considered.

It is anticipated that an Indefinite Quantity Type Contract will be awarded for this effort.  The anticipated period of performance is for five (5) years, a base period of three (3) years, and two (2) one (1) year option periods.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>VIDEO SURVEILLANCE INSTALLATION PROJECT

This project is for the installation, calibration, training and warranty of video surveillance equipment at Malmstrom AFB, MT.  A list of government provided equipment follows with quantity, manufacture and model. The equipment will be installed into ten (10) separate locations, described as military base dormitory housing. Buildings are constructed using concrete interior walls and floors and are treated as firewall. All fire wall penetrations must be treated in compliance with local codes.  Electrical and video cabling installation will be in accordance with existing local code.  Buildings will be occupied at the time of installation and contractor must take this into account when evaluating project to minimize disruption. All necessary installation materials used to install the equipment listed below are to be supplied by the contractor.  Time needed for installation is also an issue and will be considered as part of the proposal.   Upon project completion, training on the total operation of the system(s) will be provided to at least four (4) dormitory management personnel.  Installation parts and labor must be warranted for one (1) year after completion for defects in workmanship and quality.  During the warranty period contractor must supply on-site warranty labor and materials on the hardware supplied by the government. In addition during the one (1) year following the contractor must provide a minimum of at least two (2) on site visits for retraining. An on site visit to evaluate the project is highly recommended as building plans will not be supplied.  This will be a service, so all labor shall fall under the Service Contract Act.  This project is also set-aside 100% for small business.  For any questions contact Amn D.J. Thompson at (406) 731-4554 phone, (406) 731-4005 fax, or email me at Donald.Thompson@malmstrom.af.mil

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), intends to acquire on a sole-source basis from Computer Associates, 2291 Wood Oak Drive, Herndon, VA 20171, the following proprietary mainframe software, maintenance and training:  MS SQL Server Scanner Interface, MS SQL Scan, JAVA Scanner and Data Shopper for Web.  To be considered offered software products must be 100% compatible with CA-Platinum Repository base products.  Functional requirements are: 1.  MS SQL SCANNER MS SQL INTERFACE:  A scanner and an Interface that can acquire and maintain MS SQL Server resident metadata in the PR/MVS Repository base product. The MS SQL Server SCANNER add-in will be used to scan the MS SQL SERVER resident databases and create the load for PR/MVS.  It searches for data elements and creates an import file of metadata. The MS SQL INTERFACE loads the scanned metadata into the repository in a universal form that provides their access with all enterprise data elements, including their interrelationships and their relationships to applications, databases, and file systems.  2.  JAVA SCANNER:  JAVA scanner loads JAVA metadata into the PR/MVS repository in a universal form that provides their access with all enterprise data elements, including their interrelationships and their relationships to applications, databases, and file systems.  3.  DATA SHOPPER: allows users to view corporate metadata in the Repository from a standard Internet browser in a logical, business-oriented format.  It relieves the need for Repository users to have Mainframe access and gives a familiar Windows look and feel to displays.  Users can browse this information using familiar business terms, as easily as browsing for information on the World Wide Web.  In addition to the software, BPD intends to purchase 24x7 maintenance coverage and training for the above products.  Firms must submit a description of the software, maintenance, and software offered in sufficient technical detail to substantiate the ability of any alternative product to meet all these requirements.   If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable software is available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining the software through the proposed contractor, a sole-source action will be initiated.  No solicitation document is available.  Requests for a solicitation document will not be considered an affirmative response.

<DESC>The Department of Interior/GovWorks is seeking potential contractors on behalf of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Utilities Service (RUS), to provide financial advisory services in a number of technical areas. RUS makes loans and loan guarantees to rural electric Borrowers, most of which are organized as not-for-profit cooperatives.  RUS loan documents and implementing regulations require the Borrower to obtain RUS approval before entering into a variety of transactions affecting construction, operation and ownership of the Borrower system and security interests of RUS. The Applications for financial assistance or other types of approval requests for which financial advisory services may be requested include a wide variety of sometimes complex transactions. The areas of expertise required include, but are not limited to evaluation of risks relating to loans, debt restructuring, secured transactions, bond financing, leasing, utility rates analysis, due diligence and support services, indentures, mortgages, loan contracts, power marketing, market conditions, annexations, and competition. In addition to finance and industry specifics, financial advisory services shall include familiarity with credit and regulatory authority. Offerors should be familiar with rural area economics and rural cooperatives. Other agencies under the Rural Development mission area may also use these contracted services.

Approximately 300,000 Sooty Tern may be present during spring and summer.  Larger birds such as albatross, frigate birds, and boobies are also present in substantial numbers during much of the year.  The load requirements are variable, however, a minimum of four passengers seats or 850 pounds of payload is required.  Freight may include food, diving gear, live seals and birds, outboard motors, diesel engines, radio antennas, equipment parts, personal goods, mail, and maintenance equipment.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation will be negotiating with Waukesha Transformer Corporation for manufacturing two 115-kilovolt three-phase power transformers.  These transformers are required to be designed/manufactured identical to the two transformers procured under Contract No. 1425-97-CP-08310, which are currently installed at Estes Powerplant, in Estes Park, Colorado.  That contract included options for two additional transformers, however budget constraints were such that sufficient funding for the additional transformers was unavailable at that time.  The transformers must be readily interchangeable with the transformers previously furnished and installed, in order to maintain the availability of critical power generation  capability at Estes Powerplant.  In an emergency, one of these transformers must be capable of being moved into the place of either of the 2 existing Waukesha transformers.  The other transformer, which will be installed at nearby Marys Lake Powerplant must also be interchangeable with any of the three Waukesha transformers at Estes with minimum outage time.  In addition, there must be critical parts interchangeability in order to allow Estes transformers to be re-energized with parts taken from the Marys Lake transformer without relocation of the entire transformer. This sequence of transformer flexibility is critical to Reclamations unit availability commitments.

<DESC>Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) aids U.S. businesses of all sizes to invest and compete in more than 140 emerging markets and developing nations worldwide.  OPIC is a Federal agency of the U.S. Government.   OPIC?s Department of Legal Affairs is charged with providing the agency with high-quality legal representation and advice in the most practical, efficient, and cost-effective manner. To assist it in discharging these responsibilities, OPIC?s Department of Legal Affairs engages, from time to time, outside counsel.  A description of our mission and programs is found in the OPIC Program Handbook, a copy of which can be obtained from OPIC?s website at http://www.opic.gov.

OPIC contemplates the award of Basic Agreements to qualified legal firms on a competitive basis. Award of a Basic Agreement does not guarantee award of a contract, which would be the basis for performance of services.  Prospective Contractor Lists (?Lists?) will be created based on those firms awarded Basic Agreements. The Lists will be utilized to solicit bids from law firms to act as outside counsel to OPIC on matters falling within areas of expertise for which OPIC maintains a List. 

The following Lists will be developed from this competition:
1. Project Finance List: Structuring, negotiation and documentation of international project finance transactions (typically, OPIC loans to projects ranging from $20 million to $250 million), and due diligence in connection with same;
2. Insurance Claims List: Arbitration (typically under AAA international arbitration rules) arising in connection with claims for compensation under OPIC?s political risk insurance policies; and 

3.  	Investment Funds List: Structuring, negotiation, and documentation of secured loans to international private equity investment funds, and review of fund formation documents for compliance with OPIC?s program objectives.

Law firms seeking to be placed on the Lists in respect of legal services must satisfy each of the General Criteria listed below.  In addition, counsel must satisfy the specific criteria relating to the List on which such counsel seeks inclusion.

&#61623; The firm must have sufficient associate depth to commit at least one associate full-time and one associate part-time for each OPIC matter, in each case with not less than 3 years relevant experience and excellent drafting skills.
&#61623; The firm must have sufficient paralegal depth to commit at least one full-time and one part-time paralegal for each OPIC matter.
&#61623; The firm must have sufficient depth of capable attorney, paralegal, and support resources (word processing, proofreading, document distribution) to meet quick turn around times.
&#61623; The firm at a minimum, should have an office in Washington, DC and New York, NY, and members of the project team handling representation of OPIC (the ?OPIC Team?) must be able to travel as required by OPIC.
&#61623; The firm and the OPIC Team must have acceptable standards for monitoring conflicts of interest.  The firm must agree to sign the OPIC Conflicts Memorandum.

B.  Specific Criteria for each of the Three Lists:
a) Project Finance List

<DESC>In accordance with 41 USC 253(c)(1), this pre-solicitation announcement hereby advertises the Government's intention to modify its contract with The Aerospace Corp., El Segundo, CA, Number 50-SPNA-0-00012 to increase the Contractor's ceiling for the current Option Year 1 and all succeeding options by the equivalent of 20 FTE staff plus a 150 percent ceiling, per year.  The Aerospace Corporation is the single most experienced capable source that is qualified to support NOAA with the required independent space systems engineering analyses.  The Aerospace personnel, who have supported the NOAA since 1994 and the NPOESS/IPO for the past 8 years, also have a 42-year heritage with civilian and military polar-orbiting and geostationary space system.  They can apply first-hand knowledge of the engineering design of delivery systems, and the spacecraft platforms of military and civilian polar-orbiting and geosynchronous spacecraft.  Their experience includes the integration of military, civilian and foreign meteorological sensors, the impact of command, control and communications links between the ground control stations and the platforms/systems, and the analysis of satellite instrument data.  The Aerospace Corporation provides non-advocacy assessments of program implementation, design approach, advanced pre-development planning, developmental and operational risks, integration and test data analysis, launch readiness assessment, on-orbit performance assessment, ongoing analyses of associated technologies, and support to failure analysis inquiries. The Contractor will provide technical assistance and advice in the preparation and resulting evaluation of complex technical specifications.   The Aerospace Corporation maintains the unique competence and diverse expertise through its long-term design support and engineering review of civilian and military meteorological satellite platforms.  Its corporate and business practices protect Government and industry's interests and objectives by safeguarding proprietary and privileged information from misuse, and reducing the Government's costs due to duplication, delay and other general programmatic risks.  The NOAA/NESDIS Line Office requires independent R&D studies of GOES-R instrument trades, satellite constellation studies, ground system studies, and various spacecraft and payload configuration analyses to assess the optimal design for the succeeding generation of GOES satellites following the current N- series.  This additional category of GOES space systems and aeronautical, independent engineering studies, requires an incremental magnitude of support under the current contract.  This is an IDIQ task order contract. This is an expansion of the cost ceiling to accommodate this increased level of effort.  The contract's SOW scope already covers these services.  The contract is currently in Option 1 of a maximum 5-year effort. The Contractor's role in NOAA/NESDIS is as an independent, objective, non-competitive Corporation whose mission under this contract is to support the NESDIS program's strategic acquisition objectives for NPOESS, GOES and related NOAA satellite systems .  Aerospace's corporate resources and facilities help advance the Government objectives to promote competition, reduce the risks and costs of acquiring and operating satellite systems, inject technology infusion, help develop new technologies  for meteorological instruments, and satisfy NOAA's programmatic requirements with no risk of a significant organizational conflict of interest.  The Government's reliance on the Aerospace Corporation for their special competencies and the unique capability of their skills is based on longstanding experience, and validates the exception from full and open competition under 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1) for this increase to the ceiling.  Other parties who desire consideration for this requirement must fully identify their business and technical capabilities, relative to this proposed requirement, in writing to the Contracting Officer within 45 days of the date of synopsis publication.  Validation of this exception will preclude the need for a subsequent CBD notice.  No RFP is available, and will not be provided.  No future CBD notice is planned prior to award.  Please call Mr. Jay W. Moore on (301) 427-2126, ext. 112 or send an e-mail to jay.moore@noaa.gov if you have other questions on this requirement.  SEE NOTE NO.'s. 22, 25, and 26.

<ARCHDATE>04272002
<CONTACT>Warren Potter, 301-619-2383
<DESC>NA This synopsis provides the opportunity to participate in a multi-phased approach for the acquisition of 450 Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic Systems (JBAIDS) for the Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense.  The JBA IDS, to be used across the DoD, is a compact, easily portable, ruggedized, modular designed system that will accommodate preplanned performance enhancements without significant reengineering.  The initial JBAIDS design will allow for evolutionary block up grades.  The initial system deliveries will require limited development and production of devices as described as Block I.  Block I requires a device that is capable of identification of 10 biological agents and requires the contractor to start the FDA app roval process for the JBAIDS device (platform) and reagent- probe/primer kits. Block II  requires the device to have the ability to identify biological toxins,  (5 additional biological agents), and faster processing time. Also, in Block II , the contracto r will continue the FDA approval process for Block I  biological agents and start the approval process on biological Toxin reagent kits. Block III  requirements include identification of 50 BW agents and pathogens of operational concern in a hand held devi ce.  JBAIDS Block III  ORD requirements are targeted to be addressed in the post FY07 time period after technology advances. These Block III requirements are not considered part of subject solicitation. Market research conducted preceding this announcement indicates that commercial products, or modified commercial products, which will require only limited engineering and hardening for fielding, are available to fulfill the initial Block I requirements.  T he initial JBAIDS system deliveries shall, as a minimum, identify multiple (at least 10) biological agents (bacteria and viruses) in less than one hour.  JBAIDS (platform and reagents kits) devices shall be approved by the FDA as a medical diagnostic devic e.  FDA approval is not a pre-requisite for production to start on Block I or II deliveries. The Program Executive Office requires the selected development and production contractor to manufacture both platform (test equipment hardware) and reagent diagnos tic kits that will interface with Government provided BW agent targets and other DoD reagent kit manufacturing standards. During Block I, the Government anticipates purchasing 425 JBAIDS devices and approximately 700,000 reagent kits over a three-year period (plus 25 system prototypes for development testing in FY03; test system deliveries start 7 month ACA).  Production is s cheduled to start in FY04 with a minimum purchase of 140 JBAIDS systems. Quantity option bands in FY04/05/06 will have a floor of 140 JBAIDS Block I systems and a high end of 250 systems annually.  The Government also plans to purchase a minimum of 250,000  reagent (probe/primer) kits annually staring in FY04.  System performance upgrades to meet Block II JBAIDS requirements are planned but will not be included as development or production options.  Examples of these upgrades to the hardware are the addition  of biological toxin identification, faster processing time, auto/semi-automated sample preparation, and a yet specified DoD Comm Interface. The award process for the JBAIDS advanced development and production contract will be accomplished in four phases.  Phase 1 requires prospective offerors to identify themselves in writing by letter to U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN: SMDC -CM/Warren Potter, 1436 Porter Street, Ft. Detrick, MD 21702-5041 or by electronic mail to the email address: PotterW@smdc.army.mil.  This notice must include the companys DUNS number, Cage Code, Taxpayer Identification Number and a statement that the com pany is registered in the Federal Governments Central Contractor Registration program.  If you are not presently registered, you may learn how to meet this requirement at http://www.ccr.gov.  A ha ndbook is available with complete instructions on how to register.  DFARS 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information and DFARS 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration are applicable to this solicitation.  Portions of this effort are classified Secret.  The successful offeror will need to have an existing Secret Level DoD Security Clearance, or must be eligible to receive a DoD Secret Level Clearance that would be initiated at contract award IAW Defense Industrial Security Regulation, DOD 5220.22 R - M.  The successful offerors facility and the Key Personnel must be cleared for storage and use of Secret Level material in the manufacturing process.  The JBAIDS end products (platform hardware and reagent kits) will be unclassified.  Information abou t the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) may be found at http://www.dss.mil/isec/index.htm.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  You must also i nclude a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items.  You may access a copy of FAR 52.212-3 at http://www.arnet.gov/.      In addition, all prospective offerors must provide a minimum of t hree (3) past performance references.  Required information to be furnished is as follows: the most recent or relevant on-going contracts within the past three (3) years as well as the contract number, contract type, dollar value, period of performance, da te of award, the period of performance, extent of subcontracting, names, phone numbers and email addresses of at least two (2) points of contact for each contract.  If you do not have any current government contracts or have not had government contracts in  the past three (3) years, provide the same information on three current commercial contracts.  This information must be received either by conventional mail/delivery services or electronically to the email address provided above by March 28, 2002.  The Go vernment will assess past performance information for performance risk.  The government may use one or more methods to verify and obtain information regarding your performance and the contract information furnished.  At its option, the government may elect  to evaluate past performance using questionnaires, telephone interviews and site visits.  Unless your firm is a small business, past performance information shall be the criteria in the determination of contractor responsibility pursuant to Federal Acquis ition Regulations Part 9.  In the event that adverse past performance information is revealed, you shall be provided written notice of the adverse review and afforded the opportunity to respond.  If the responsibility of a small business is questionable, t he Small Business Administration shall be contacted for a Certificate of Competency.  All offerors must be determined to be responsible with a low performance risk to advance to the next phase.  The initial Government screening process for JBAIDS will requ ire perspective contractors to adequately describe and provide documentation as to how they will be able to produce and deliver within a period of 7 months the initial systems.  Your description and documentation must demonstrate the prospective offerors ability to meet all of the initial screening criteria below: 1.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) requires drilling services to obtain continuous core samples at Englebright Lake, a reservoir in Nevada County, CA. The samples will be used to determine the concentration of mercury and other metals in the sediment and the volume and particle-size distribution of sediment in the reservoir. Contractor will drill an adjacent pair of holes and retrieve core segments for overlapping depth intervals at 15 locations in the lake. The pair of holes will be replicated at each of the 15 locations for a total of four holes and two complete core samples of sediments. Individual core lengths range from 10' to 130', total sample length between 2000' and 3000'. Core segment diameter at least 6.2 cm (2.44"). Englebright Lake is approximately 8 miles long and 1/4 mile wide at its widest point. Englebright Dam is 260 feet high, so the maximum depth of water plus borehole is 260' (80 m). Maximum water depth near the dam is about 120' (60 m) at normal pool. Some drill sites may be in the shallowest water accessible by the Contractor's equipment. The particle-size distribution of the sediments is thought to be primarily silt and clay near the dam and sand, gravel, and possibly cobbles at the upstream end of the reservoir. Within each borehole, the Contractor should expect to encounter layers of sediment with various particle sizes, including gravel, as layers of deposits from various flood events are penetrated. Contractor must use professional judgment regarding drilling methods needed in response to conditions encountered and shall expect to use various coring methods, including pistoncoring, pushcoring, vibracoring, rotary and diamond-bit. Government may require coring through 1 to 2 feet of fractured or weathered bedrock when determined essential to meet the objectives of the project. Access to worksite is by a steep single-lane paved road. Contractor shall provide one or more drilling systems capable of meeting Government's requirements in conditions described herein, with appropriate drilling platform with area at least 80 sq ft for Government to inspect and process the cores, and means to move platform to any part of lake. Prior to commencement of drilling, the Government shall test the contractor's drilling equipment and proposed additives for mercury contamination at a location selected by the Government. Anticipated performance period 28 days commencing mid-April and completion by May 24, 2002. Applicable Service Contract Act wage determination will be included in the RFP. Successful offeror will have recent core drilling experience on other similar scientific projects. The Government's ability to award this contract is subject to availability of funds. Request RFP containing complete specifications, plans, terms, and evaluation criteria from Phyllis Michel, Contracting Officer, U.S. Geological Survey, Acquisition and Grants Branch, 345 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025-3591, or by fax at (650) 329-5480 or email at pmichel@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) needs to charter trawl vessels to (1) tag and release Atka mackerel, and (2) recover tagged mackerel in the vicinity of Seguam and Tonaga Passes, Aleutian Islands, Alaska.  Two different vessel types are required and the NMFS desires that vessels form a teaming arrangement with each other to provide both vessels under a single charter contract. The charter contract will include options, to be exercised at the Government's sole discretion, to charter the vessels again for two additional years. (1) The tag and release vessel must be a trawler with a minimum registered length of 120 ft., and 1,000 minimum continuous horsepower from the main engine.  The release charter is expected to last 28 days, in order to tag 30,000 fish in the Seguam Pass area and 15,000 fish in the Tanago Pass area. The release charter must start as near as possible to June 15, 2002. The release vessel must be completely rigged for trawling, and have sufficient fuel and fuel-holding capacity to conduct 33 days of charter operations without refueling. Minimum crew shall consist of captain, lead-fisherman, engineer-fisherman, and cook-fisherman. The government party on the release charter shall consist of five persons, and will include women. Expected start and end location is Dutch Harbor, Alaska.  (2) The recovery vessel will supply all trawl nets, trawl rigging, doors and net electronics, be a minimum of 125 feet in length, and have sufficient fuel-holding capacity to conduct the recovery charter operations for at least 23 days without refueling.  The recovery vessel must be equipped with an inside factory for processing and freezing fish as the commercial sale of scientific catch shall be used to offset the costs of the tag and release charter.  The recovery charter will augment the tag recovery effort by the commercial fleet during the B-season Atka mackerel fishery, and will also provide tag recovery effort in the area closed to the fishery. The recovery charter will occur during two separate time periods, before and after the fishery.  The starting dates are negotiable.  The before-fishery recovery will start around August 19, 2002 and the after-fishery recovery will start around October 1, 2002. In addition to having a crew commensurate with the size of the recovery vessel and the expected catch, the recovery vessel  must also provide at least two (2) trained biologists to conduct data collection operations.  The government party on the recovery charter shall consist of four persons, and will include women. All responsible, responsive offers will be considered. Offers must fully disclose the teaming arrangement entered into by the vessels (i.e., partnership, joint venture, or subcontract).  A Request for Proposals providing detailed technical and performance specifications and proposal instructions will be issued on or about March 12, 2002.  For a copy of the solicitation please fax your request to Crystina Elkins at (206) 526-6025.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Synopsis:

General Statement of Research Need

The Organic Mine Countermeasures Future Naval Capability (OMCM FNC) program seeks white papers and full proposals describing technology development and demonstration concepts for performing Mine Countermeasure (MCM) tasks organically from U. S. Navy amphibious warfare ships using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs).  These concepts must support naval amphibious warfare operations such as power projection.  Concepts should include influence minesweeping and mine reconnaissance capabilities hosted aboard an USV.  Concepts should demonstrate that a capable USV will supplement future Naval systems for organic MCM in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) and Shallow Water (SW) operational environments.  Concepts should reflect integration with existing/developing small boat assets onboard Navy amphibious ships to minimize the impact of adding MCM mission capability aboard these Navy ships.   Technology demonstrations of the USV-MCM concept shall be performed in concert with other, ongoing OMCM FNC initiatives in FY03 and FY05, showing compatibility with amphibious warfare ships during fleet operational conditions. 

The scope of the effort proposed in the white papers should include:  1) integration of an influence minesweeping payload into the USV; 2) integration of a mine reconnaissance payload into the USV; 3) two technology demonstrations, each conducted under fleet operational conditions, hosted aboard an amphibious warship, and preceded by a preliminary sea test; and 4) performance of a Fleet Integration Study, i.e., an investigation of USV and MCM payload technologies, alternatives, and recommendations for integration with the fleet.

The emphasis of the effort proposed in the white papers shall be:  1) demonstration of successful mine reconnaissance and influence minesweeping from a small, host ship-compatible USV; and 2) demonstration of innovative integration approaches for reduced impact on the host amphibious ship (i.e., minimum manning, weight, and footprint, and preservation of ship's performance in other mission areas). 

The Government will make available an 11m Rigid-hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) with rudimentary onboard remote control hardware, line of sight RF link for C&C and video, and PC-based ground control station for the development and demonstration effort. 

To assist in providing prospective offerors information leading to more responsive white papers and full proposals, the ONR is establishing a World Wide Web Site http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/baa/baa_02_010 that includes, or includes links to, relevant documents describing background investigations, USV data, additional Government guidance related to USV-MCM concepts and strategy, and Frequently Asked Questions.  The Web Site will also include a question/answer forum for potential offerors to obtain additional information regarding requirements, desired capabilities, and constraints. 

Instructions for Preparation of White Papers and Full Proposals

White papers are initially sought to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror in preparing full technical and cost proposals without an initial assessment of the operational, technical, and logistical feasibility of the concept. 

White papers should be limited to seven pages and should include the following items:  (A) Cover Page, clearly labeled "WHITE PAPER", including BAA title and date, title of white paper, administrative and technical points of contact along with email addresses and telephone and fax numbers; (B) Technical Description, to consist of clear discussions of the concept and associated technologies being proposed, development objectives of the proposed effort, major technical issues to be resolved to accomplish objectives, approaches to resolving these issues, and a clear description of and schedule for demonstration of the development; (C) Managerial Description, to include partnering arrangements if any, list of key personnel, specific prior experience of offeror in the technology areas addressed, facilities, and a plan of action with milestones; (D) Cost Description, to be a one page cost estimate on a yearly basis partitioned by major tasks.   One-page curricula vitae for the Principal Technical Investigator, Project Manager, and other key personnel should be submitted.  The cover page and curricula vitae will not count toward the seven-page limit.  Eight copies of the white papers are due at the submittal address listed below by 1600 EST, 04-April-2002. 

All white papers will be acknowledged via e-mail.  White papers will not be returned after evaluation.  Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their white paper submission.  However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award. Any offeror may submit a full proposal even if its white paper was not identified as promising or if no white paper is submitted.

The format for subsequent full proposals will be posted at http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/baa/baa_02_010 on or about 04-April-2002. Full proposals are due by 1600 EST, 31-May-2002.  It is anticipated that funding decisions will have been completed by 14-June-2002, followed immediately by funding actions. Though contracts are anticipated, awards may be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as appropriate.  The maximum length of an award will be three years.

52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

 	1) Technical Experience and Past Performance

Technical Experience--The offeror shall submit documentation describing its experience as a company or corporation or by its employees or personnel they have retained in performing and managing maintenance and repairs of hoists.  Experience may be commercial and/or Governmental.  Offerors shall have a minimum of 10 years cumulative experience working on the specified types of hoists.   This experience requirement relates to the company and/or key personnel.  Thus, a firm in existence for less than 10 years, but having key personnel with at least 10 years of required experience, may be able to meet this requirement.

Past Performance--The offeror shall submit references relevant to the nature and magnitude of this requirement for the past ten (10) years from previous/current requirements of this type of work.  Required documentation shall contain the name of the reference, a point of contact, phone number and address for each reference.   This information shall be submitted with the offer and shall include, but not be limited to, contract number, scope and magnitude of the contract, point of contact name and telephone number.  It shall also include a short narrative which adequately describes the offeror's actual past performance.  For example, the narratives shall describe the contractor's adherence to contract schedules, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, as well as business-like commitment to customer satisfaction.  Past performance will be evaluated on a pass or fail basis.  Offerors lacking past performance information will be rated neutral (=pass).
  
2) Price    

Only price proposals submitted by offerors whose technical proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation.  The lowest price offer will be computed by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basis period.  Proposed prices will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed in Far 15.404-1(b) to determine price reasonableness.

Technical experience and past performance are significantly more important than cost or price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  The above Provisions and Clauses may be obtained via Internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil. All proposals must be mailed to Carl See at 97 CONS/LGCA, 205 S. 6th Street Altus AFB OK 73523-5147, or may be faxed to Carl See at fax number (580) 481-7472. Award will be made to the lowest responsive and responsible offeror. Proposals are required not later than 2:00 PM CST, 4 Mar 2002.

All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency. No paper copies of the solicitation will be available.

Mission data will be uploaded to the MALD via CMBRE or an aircraft-to-decoy data interface."  d) Add the following:  The Precision Strike SPO has scheduled an industry day at Eglin AFB during the week of 26 ? 28 MAR 02.

The purpose of this release is to provide early information to potential ground system and avionics vendors pertinent to the overall aspects of the NEXCOM program.  The FAA plans to discuss these documents along with other programmatic information during Industry Day II, Jan 22- 25, 2002 with those vendors whose reservations have been confirmed by the FAA NEXCOM Program Office. <P> The final SRD has been updated based upon a review of comments previously submitted by interested parties. <P> The MTD describes in detail the full set of requirements (based upon the SRD) to design and build the HW and SW components of the NEXCOM System Engineering Design Model (EDM) for the Rapid Preliminary Development Effort (RPDE).  The MTD is a subset of SRD requirements.  The EDM will be used during the Full Scale Development Program (FSDP) technical evaluation process to demonstrate and verify vendor understanding of basic VDL Mode 3 technology.   The SRD is provided for information.  Limited comments concerning the draft MTD should be presented to the FAA at the scheduled one-on-ones during Industry Day II; however, formal written comments can be submitted through the period of January 11 to February 22, 2002.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is seeking an independent contractor to conduct an inquiry and develop recommendations for consideration by sovereign tribal governments to support community members who have disabilities in four selected and interconnected areas--education, health, rehabilitation and independent living.  NCD determined these priorities through (a) a review of available reports that support the premise of linkages among these areas, and (b) recent conversations with advocates and professionals, including people with disabilities, representatives and leaders of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The project must analyze the status of previous findings and recommendations and describe practices that contribute to improving the quality of life for American Indians and Alaska Natives with disabilities living on tribal lands. NCD is interested in funding an investigation wherein the contractor will: (1) summarize recommendations from relevant research and reports on health, rehabilitation, and education issues that impact independent living and self-determination realities for people with disabilities living on tribal lands; (2) provide scheduled involvement for representatives of American Indians and Alaska Native communities, advocates, and key organizations concerned with issues of education, rehabilitation, health, and independent living as project advisers; (3) identify and recommend basic factors/elements and key processes that have been productive in getting sovereign governments to develop tribal laws to protect and meet the service needs of people with disabilities who live on tribal lands; (4) provide a capacity building toolkit that must be user friendly, incorporate principles of cultural competency, and include as examples for consideration what seems to be working/what has been effective in different tribal setting; (5) assess and recommend government-to-government (state to sovereign tribal to U.S. government) improvements in relationships needed for effective coordination across existing federally funded projects/programs; and (6) plan to broadly disseminate the project materials among Native people.
 
The plan for this investigation should project a seven (7) month implementation work schedule. The approximate release and closing dates are January 30, 2002, and April 2, 2002, respectively. The estimated contract period of performance is seven months. Requests for copies of the RFP may be made by mail or picked up on or after the issue date at the NCD address. All requests should reference the number and title of the RFP.  All inquiries regarding this RFP should be directed to Gerrie Hawkins, Ph.D., 202-272-2116, ghawkins@ncd.gov, addressed to the National Council on Disability, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to seek industry comments and inputs concerning a Billing and Accounting System for the EOS Data and Information System Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs).   The EOSDIS DAACs acquire, process and deliver very large volumes (estimated to reach at least 250 terabytes/year on media by 2002) of remote sensing and related data to research scientists and public and governmental entities that apply this physical information to understand and solve major problems in the Earth Sciences, such as global change, environmental monitoring, agricultural inventory, etc. Consistent with NASA's Earth Science Enterprise Data Policy and Federal regulations (OMB Circulars A-130 and A-25), the ESDIS Project is considering a program of recovering certain costs from users who obtain data and information services from the EOSDIS DAACs. The ESDIS Project is interested in awarding a contract for a Billing and Accounting System that would work cooperatively with the ESDIS Science Operations Office (SOO) and the DAACs. The functions of the Billing and Accounting System within the DAACs would include, but are not limited to:  1) Receive product price list from DAACs (and at least annual updates),  2) Allow DAAC users to establish accounts (including prepaid accounts or purchase order accounts), 3) Allow for NASA funded accounts, either through pre-payment or by pre-authorization and billing,  4) Receive notice of data set order from DAACs,  5) Invoice and collect payment (by check or electronic funds transfer) for order from customer (track by order number),  6) Provide notice to DAAC that data can be shipped,   7) Provide postage / shipping authorization to DAACs (e.g. Postal meter with contractor account and pre-paid UPS/FedEx shipping.),  8) Receive notice from DAAC regarding refund or replacement of data set,   9) Send refund to customer or credit customer account,  10) Supply media, postage, materials, and postal charges to DAACs for replacement data sets, 11) Respond to user queries concerning account or order payment status,  12) Provide regular activity reports.  Questions to be Answered: 1. What specific operations concepts or requirements as described in the reference documentation will likely require special development or extensions to currently available off-the-shelf products? 2. If you would be proposing an off-the-shelf solution, how would price be determined if the solution were to be used by one or more DAACs? 3. What efforts would be necessary to complete integration of your solution with the DAAC search and order tools, and to the DAAC data distribution systems, as described in the operations concept and requirements documentation? 4. What changes would you suggest to the referenced operations concept and requirements to best enable use of your solution with the DAAC search and order tools and with the DAAC data distribution systems? 5. If these changes were made to the operations concept and requirements, what effort would be necessary to complete integration of your solution with the DAAC search and order tools and with the DAAC data distribution systems? 6. What changes would you recommend be made to the operations concept and requirements documents in order to reduce life cycle costs yet satisfy the goals of the ESDIS billing and accounting program? 7. What would a the billing and accounting system cost? For an understanding of the scope of operation of the Billing and Accounting System respondents should review the provided references. These documents serve as a backdrop against which respondents must frame and pose the appropriate advanced information technology topics for further consideration: Reference 1. Billing and Account Operations Concept (includes Billing and Accounting Policy documents) (Draft, January 2002)	http://ramulus.gsfc.nasa.gov/ba 	 2. Billing and Account System Requirements(Draft, Janaury 2002) http://romulus.gsfc.nasa.gov/ba 	 3.

DAAC Usage Statistics http://lyta.gsfc.nasa.gov/~imswww/statGlobalTextSummary.text Table 1 In addition, information concerning the EOSDIS DAACs is available on-line at: http://ulabibm.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac/ The on-line product search and order capability provided by NASA's National Space Science Data Center is an example of a successful implementation of an end user interface for ordering and paying for NASA data products that exemplifies how such functions may be provided in a manner compliant with NASA policy and commercial practice.  It is available on-line at: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ The ESDIS Project encourages responses from businesses or other groups interested in the opportunity of providing a Billing and Accounting System.  The responses should demonstrate the operational reliability and robustness of the proposed approach, as well as simplicity and straightforwardness for users and the DAACs.  The responses should show how the System could adapt to growth in the user community, the number of data centers it supports, changes in systems it interfaces with, and new technology for electronic commerce. Sources with information relevant to this request are asked to respond by submitting a white paper of no more than five (5) pages which conforms to Annex 1, "Template For Billing and Accounting System Submittal". The paper should clearly address a prospective Billing and Accounting System approach to providing a portion or all of the needed capabilities.  Please provide rough costs estimates for any Commercial-Off-the-Shelf products and the effort needed to integrate the proposed Billing and Accounting System with the DAAC systems, regardless of who is proposed for performing the integration.  Comments and suggestions for improving the referenced Billing and Accounting Operations Concept and the Billing and Accounting System Requirements are encouraged and solicited.  All information received from this RFI will be combined and used for government procurement planning purposes. Sources are urged to describe their approach in enough detail so that NASA can plan for subsequent proposal opportunities for which proprietary information is appropriate.  The information received in response to this RFI will be reviewed and summarized by a panel of experts. Some or no part of the summarized and synthesized recommendations may or may not form the basis of a future NASA solicitation, such as a NASA RFP (Request for Proposals).  Annex 1 TEMPLATE FOR BILLING AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEM SUBMITTAL 8. Background and Description of Proposed Approach 	 Describe in adequate detail the specific approach to implementing a Billing and Accounting System being proposed for ESDIS Project consideration, the current state of its development, how interfaces to DAAC-based systems would be implemented, the comparability of your approach with or its use of current and/or anticipated commercial approaches.

<DESC>Sources sought to continue the development and integration of the direct injection components into the Radio Frequency Generation and Injection System developed by Amherst Systems and Boeing.  The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFFTC ? AF Flight Test Center, is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential offerors with the capability of performing the proposed effort.  The initial development effort on this system provided for the simulation of multiple radar and other RF (radio frequency) signals in a virtual environment, along with the generation of real RF signals radiated into free space.  The initial development also provided the design and equipment to generate low-level signal outputs suitable for direct injection into a sensor input port.  The low-level output capability, however, has not been fully integrated into the system.  The scope of work requires the contractor to complete the development and integration of the direct injection components ensuring that this development and integration are accomplished successfully and effectively within the existing system design and using already-acquired system components.  However, access to the current system design is limited due to the proprietary nature and limited availability of existing system documentation and drawings.  The expected technical effort includes:  assembling existing components into direct injection configurations; implementing all software, hardware, and firmware changes required to generate simulate signals and control system components; installing and testing the system at Edwards AFB; and updating system documentation and drawings.  The direct injection system will provide signals to output ports whose amplitude and phase are representative of the simulated signal environment.  Configurations will be provided for 3 channels into 176 output ports, and for 6 channels into 80 ports.  Government furnished equipment will be provided as required; however, impacts to facility operations using existing equipment will be minimized.  The purpose of this sources sought announcement is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining how this procurement will be acquired.  In order to determine if your company can perform the effort, we are requesting that each company provide a capability statement, past performance history of similar work, and other information deemed appropriate to assist the Government in making this determination.  All documents shall be typewritten and faxed to Joanne Eldredge at 661 275-7852 or mailed to the aforementioned address by 27 Mar 2002.  You may contact Joanne Eldredge at 661 277-9601 if you have questions about this announcement.  If we receive no definite information that other offerors can perform this work, this procurement will be advertised on an other than full and open competition basis.   Please be advised of the following:  This program will involve technology acquisitions that have military applications and are subject to Air Force Materiel Command Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Section 5393, Foreign Disclosure Reviews.

<DESC>The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) provides emergency and wildland fire support to federal, state, and international agencies. Transporting personnel and cargo is a critical part of the mission. NIFC maintains exclusive use contracts for a small fleet of aircraft, but must rely on charter support during periods of extensive activity. Over the course of recent fire seasons, NIFC has transported approximately 22,000 firefighters each season, with expenditures for charter aircraft averaging $3,700,000 annually.  We are currently seeking additional companies in the airline charter business that are capable of carrying 20 or more passengers.  If you are interested in being added to our list, please send the following information to the address listed in the contact section of this notice: Charter Representative; 24- hour contact person; Equipment operated and capabilities (passengers and cargo); Area of operation; costing structure; Copy of standard charter agreement; ARINC or SITA address for charter solicitations; Copy of Air Carriers Certificates. In addition to single flight charters, NIFC occasionally has need for exclusive use of large transport aircraft for short periods of time (one to two weeks). To meet this extended need NIFC has, in the past, retained aircraft on short-term contract. Dates of aircraft needs are dependent on the severity of the summer fire season and generally will occur in July and August. If you are interested in offering aircraft for possible extended use, please indicate so in your response. NIFC will maintain a source list of potential vendors, and make contact with each company as the need dictates. Please note this extended use arrangement will only be used as needed. No guarantee of employment will be implied. Certain firefighting crews desire to travel with chainsaws. Please indicate in your response what requirements you deem appropriate to allow fire crews to transport chainsaws. Most crews pack their chainsaws in specialized transport bags, taking cares to ensure that the contents are clean and secure within the bag. A chainsaw bag would typically contain the following items: 2 Chainsaws; 4 pair of chaps; 9 pre-packed oil *Sigg full (bar oil); mix oil, 6-pack (original container); falling wedge; 6 saw chains; jerry can spout and funnel; an extra chainsaw bar; 23 pre-packed gas *Sigg bottles (empty); 5 gallon cubtainer; box of 7/32" files; spare saw parts and filters. *Sigg bottles are a one piece extruded alloy bottle with no-leak rubber sealed screw tops, made specifically for the purpose of containing fuel. If your services are used, payment will be made using a standard Government Transportation Request (GTR). Payments are processed within 15 days after the National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC) receives the invoice. All billing documents will be sent to NICC Staff Assistant, at the address listed under contact information. Please submit original invoice(s) for payment by Express or U.S. Postal Service Mail. Should you need any additional information, please contact Neal Hitchcock at telephone 208-387-5400. No formal solicitation will be issued.

<SUBJECT>99 -- GSA Announces Two FAMIS Government Days
<DESC>**This announcement is for Executive Branch Federal Government entities Only.**


The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and the Procurement Executives Council (PEC) initiated a re-design of the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS).  The re-engineered system will be the Federal Acquisition Management Information System (FAMIS).  Public Law 93-400 established the FPDS for collecting, developing, and disseminating procurement data.  FAMIS is an enhancement to integrate with agency electronic commerce systems and to provide timely management information.

All interested Executive Branch federal agencies are invited to participate in one of two public forums to discuss the Government?s informational and operational needs.  The forums will be held on March 7 and 13, 2002, from 8:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m., each of the two days, in the GSA Auditorium, 18th and F Streets, NW, Washington, D.C.

A U.S. Government building pass will be required to enter the forum.

Information regarding the FPDS re-engineering initiative is available on the FAMIS website at www.arnet.gov/egov/famis/famis2.html.
