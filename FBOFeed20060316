<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Office of Acquisition and Assistance in Dhaka, Bangladesh, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from qualified organizations interested in implementing the Poverty Reduction by Increasing the Competitiveness of Enterprises (PRICE) component, also referred to as a sub-activity, of USAID’s Economic Development and Growth with Equity (EDGE) activity.

USAID/Bangladesh acknowledges that a vibrant private sector is essential to economic growth and poverty reduction. Furthermore, USAID contends that in order to address Bangladesh’s daunting level of poverty, economic growth must be tempered with a focus on equity as outlined in the Government of Bangladesh’ Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). 

The PRICE sub-activity will be the principal mechanism by which USAID provides technical assistance to the private sector. The PRICE implementer will work in collaboration with various non-governmental organizations, and relevant Government of Bangladesh (GOB) ministries, including the Ministry of Commerce. The PRICE implementer will work with enterprises within three sub-sectors with the intention of promoting growth that is pro-poor and decreases the equity gap; increases access to new, profitable markets; leverages financing; improves workforce skills; expands the presence of embedded business development services; encourages applied research and increases the use of information and communications technology (ICT) as a productivity-enhancing tool.     

PRICE is one sub-activity of the USAID/Bangladesh’s broader Economic Development and Growth with Equity (EDGE) activity. To achieve broad-based economic growth requires effective engagement of the public and private sectors. Consequently, the EDGE activity consists of two, complementary implementation subactivities:

1.  Poverty Reduction by Increasing the Competitiveness of Enterprises (PRICE), 
2.  Policy Analysis, Monitoring and Assessment (PAMA).

PRICE is designed to ensure interventions support pro-poor economic growth. The PAMA sub-activity involves strengthening the development and reform of pro-poor and pro-business policies and regulations in Bangladesh. The PAMA and PRICE implementers will be expected to work in concert to ensure interventions are effective and measures to promote equity are adopted within each assisted sub-sector. Potential offerors are invited to go to http://www.usaid.gov/bd/files/edge_activity.pdf  (Proposal Information webpage of USAID/Bangladesh) for an extended narrative on the EDGE activity, its components and relevant background reports and studies.

The PRICE contract’s period of performance is expected to be five years with a total estimated cost of $11.5 million. USAID encourages the participation of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns as the prime contractor or as subcontractors in the implementation of this proposed award.     
 
The RFP is expected to be issued by mid-April 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Service Administration. Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued and posted on that website along with the RFP. Offerors are encouraged to check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) periodically.

<DESC>The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (EP) initiative is the largest commitment ever by a nation toward an international health initiative for a single disease.  It is a five-year, $15 billion, multifaceted approach to combating the disease in more than 100 countries around the world.  The strategy places an intensified approach on 15 focus countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia that represent approximately half the world’s infections.   The goal of the EP is to treat 2 million HIV-infected individuals, prevent 7 million new infections and to provide care and support for 10 million HIV-infected individuals and orphans.  HIV/AIDS activities in Vietnam supported by the U.S. Government began in the mid-1990’s.  Since Vietnam’s designation as the 15th focus country for the EP in June 2004, HIV/AIDS assistance to Vietnam has grown steadily changing significantly in terms of funding levels, complexity and the nature of the programs. 
A consortium of U.S. Government agencies is charged with coordinating and managing the EP under the leadership of the U.S. Ambassador.  These agencies include the Department of State, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DoD).  The goal is to develop one cohesive and effective U.S. Government (USG) HIV/AIDS program in Vietnam utilizing the strengths and capabilities of all the government agencies.  The Chief of Mission (COM) and Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) oversee and coordinate the activities of the EP Team in planning and implementing the EP.  The EP Program Coordinator will work closely with and under the direction of the COM/DCM in these efforts.The primary responsibilities include facilitating communications between and among the various USG departments and agencies involved in the EP, liaising routinely with the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), ensuring proper coordination and communication between the EP Team and the various coordinating bodies in Vietnam including the Government of Vietnam, major ministries including the Ministry of Health and the EP Secretariat, and major donors (Global Fund, World Bank, Department for International Development (DfID),  etc.).  S/he will play a lead role in coordinating the development of annual Country Operational Plans (COP) and the submission of semi-annual and annual reports and other documentation as required by OGAC.  In addition, s/he will provide advice and counsel to the COM and DCM on all matters related to HIV/AIDS in Vietnam.

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  In this context, the NIAID's mission includes the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.  These biological agents have been prioritized as Category A, B, and C.  Through this solicitation the NIAID is seeking to advance the development of therapeutics against selected NIAID Category A, B, and C bacterial pathogens via a focused, staged approach. Specifically the goal of this solicitation is to develop new, safe, and effective therapeutics for:

* Bacillus anthracis
* Yersinia pestis
* Francisella tularensis
* Burkholderia pseudomallei
* Burkholderia mallei
* Rickettsia prowazekii

Pathogens, excluding sexually-transmitted organisms (see http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/anti_stis.htm for list of excluded organisms), resistant to antimicrobial agents were recently added to the NIAID Biodefense Category C priority pathogens list. This solicitation will also support the development of candidate therapeutics with broad spectrum activity against NIAID Category C antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogen(s) and at least one of the selected Category A or B bacterial pathogens (B. anthracis, Y. pestis, F. tularensis, B. pseudomallei, B. mallei and R. prowazekii). 

The candidate therapeutic should be at a stage of development that is minimally within five (5) years of completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial.  This solicitation will support non-clinical studies, medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and other Investigational New Drug (IND)-, New Drug Application (NDA)-, or Biologic License Application (BLA)-enabling studies.  The NIAID is particularly interested in candidate therapeutics that have broad spectrum activity and are within the regulatory purview of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of up to five (5) years beginning on or about June 12, 2007.  BAA NIH-NIAID-DMID-07-37 will be available electronically on or about March 31, 2006 and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (AO) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

NIAID/OA Home Page (via the WWW): Use http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract to access the NIAID/AO Home Page. Once at the NIAID/AO Home Page, click on the "RFPs" link and then click on "BAA NIH-NIAID-DMID-07-37, entitled, 'Development of Therapeutic Agents for Selected Biodefense Bacterial Diseases'."  

Proposals will be due on or about September 12, 2006.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government.

NCIS is collaboratively engaged with local and state law enforcement agencies to share criminal records management and investigative information so as to affect a major impact on officer and public safety, by insuring immediate access to information that will deter criminal and terrorist related activities in applicable regions.  The LInX System fully integrates law enforcement data from all participating agencies into a single regional database.  The Government intends to acquire these services on other than a full and open competitive basis with Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT), 7575 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA 22102 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy the Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

During this interim period, the LInX Program is to be completed or at initial operating capability (IOC) for the aforementioned sites.  Completed is defined as encompassing such functions as:  all data to be shared has been extracted, mapped, gone through IV & V testing as well as testing at NCIS, program is loaded into production, etc.   Award of a Labor Hour contract is anticipated for the interim period described above commencing 01 May 2006 through 2006 through 31 January 2007, if all options are exercised.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A subsequent synopsis for the competitive LInX acquisition will be issued under a separate FEDBIZOPPS notice by FISC Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia Office at a later date.  This competitive follow-on acquisition will result in an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contract and will require the maintenance of the LInX Program within the aforementioned sites, as well as the deployment and operation of the LInX Program at a minimum of three new sites including, but not limited to, New London/Groton, New Mexico, and San Diego. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.

<CONTACT>JOSHUA M. BOWERS, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 513-487-2104, E-Mail: bowers.joshua@epa.gov
<DESC>This is a supplement to Fedbizopps sources sought synopsis PR-CI-06-10372 first posted on March 1, 2006. After evaluation of responses to the sources sought notice, the U.S. EPA hereby issues this pre-solicitation notice. The solicitation PR-CI-06-10372 will be competed using full & open competition. The Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected to be issued around April 1 and close 30 days thereafter. It will be available on the Internet at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the web site. Hard copies will not be distributed. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to frequently check the site for amendments. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. A fixed-price contract award will be made on or around June 1, 2006 in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. The applicable NAICS code is 541710. A summary of the technical requirements, as posted in the sources sought notice are as follows:  The U.S. EPA?s National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) is currently investigating various decontamination technologies for high value building materials contaminated with Bacillus anthracis.  Current on-going studies inoculate building material coupons using a syringe (liquid droplets).  However, the likely dissemination method for B. anthracis is aerosol dispersion, thus building materials will be contaminated by dry deposition.  Liquid inoculation may yield non-comparable decontamination efficacy results to actual event decontamination efforts for porous materials such as cinder block and wood.  A system for the dry inoculation of building material coupons is needed to ensure comparable efficacy results during decontamination efforts. In response to the need for reproducibly dosing building material coupons with dry B. anthracis, the U.S. EPA/NHSRC?s Decontamination and Consequence Management Division (DCMD) is seeking to develop an aerosol deposition system for use in the systematic decontamination studies.  The system shall be able to reproducibly (within 20%) dose coupons with user defined spore loadings in the range of 102 - 108 spores per coupon (7 cm2).  The terminal velocities of these spores shall mimic those expected in an anthrax release.  The system shall be applicable to all building materials of interest, specifically: painted and unpainted cinder block, stainless steel ductwork,  industrial carpet, decorative laminate, ceiling tile, painted wallboard, and glass.  The system shall be able to dose at least twenty-five 20 mm x 35 mm coupons during a single deposition and the coupons shall be easy to remove, ensuring minimal disruption of the deposited particulate matter. As the B. anthracis innoculant is limited in availability, the deposition process must be efficient so as to conserve inocculant.  The deposition system shall be entirely contained to prevent environmental interference and contamination.  The system shall be both portable and autoclavable.   The performance of the aerosol deposition system shall be evaluated with a suitable surrogate for B. anthracis that is 1-3 ?m in diameter.  Uniformity of the aerosol deposition and reproducibility of coupon dosing shall be determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy or another comparable technology.  The ability for the system to deliver the needed concentrations of the spores to the building material coupons will be accessed here at the EPA and if the aerosol delivery system is unable to meet the specifications listed in the statement of work then the system shall be modified until it fulfills these requirements.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541618   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), Energy Supply and Industry Branch (ESIB) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures to In-Town Consulting, of Denver, CO.  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain support for the Green Power Leadership Awards to be held at the 2006 Eleventh National Renewable Energy  Marketing Conference in San Francisco, CA on December 6, 2006.  Under this order, and in conjunction with support from the U.S. Department of Energy, In-Town Consulting will design and implement a national awards program to recognize leading green power purchasers and suppliers. The competitive  awards will recognize outstanding commitments and achievements in the green power marketplace in various categories for purchasers, suppliers and market development. This recognition program plays an integral role in furthering CPPD's mission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by supporting  environmentally preferable renewable energy sources with significantly less air pollution.  Tasks under this purchase order will include working with national experts and members of the green power industry to update operating procedures and criteria for each award category and the award process;  developing a web-based call for nominations; identifying and retaining an evaluation committee; processing all nominations received; creating evaluation materials and facilitating two evaluation panels which will select award winners; communicating with nominees and winners; developing and  producing ceremony materials, developing press releases and other media materials; developing all necessary materials for the awards ceremony; on-site implementation of the awards ceremony; and follow up with media contacts and winners.  It has been determined that because of In-Town Consulting's  unique working relationships that enable it to engage technical experts and members of the green power industry, which furthers its ability to produce and implement a quality national awards event, it is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement. In addition, In-Town Consulting has  demonstrated extensive experience in planning and implementing methodologies for technical award criteria, has demonstrated specific capabilities to implement web-based outreach activities, and has an extensive capacity to develop, manage and disseminate the required event information and materials  as they relate specifically to renewable energy partners.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541611. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as  stated herein may submit a response which, if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of  the Government. The estimated value of this procurement is below the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in FAR 2.101. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Sole-Source Requirement for TC-150M Multi-Band Amplifiers

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has a requirement to procure TC-150M Multi-Band amplifiers on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than Full and Open Competition in 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The required items will be procured on a Firm-Fixed Price basis, and the award will be processed in accordance with the procedures at FAR 13.5.  The resultant contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a minimum quantity of seven (7) and a maximum total quantity of twenty-seven (27).  The intended source is Talla-Com Industries located in Tallahassee, FL. Talla-Com is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the required amplifiers. These amplifiers are required for integration into the Joint Base Station (JBS) System that has been designed around the Talla-Com amplifier, as it was the only design able to meet all of the JBS System requirements at the time of the initial design. An industry review did not reveal any other products capable of meeting all of the Government’s requirements. Procuring amplifiers from an alternate source would cause the Government to incur costs associate with: nonrecurring engineering (NRE) to modify the current design of the JBS systems, labor and materials to build new mounts to replace the existing ones, test and validate the functionality of the alternative solution with the JBS systems, and logistics support to design new cases and drawings, recreate user documentation, revise training packages, and Configuration Management (CM) over a ten (10) year life cycle for these systems. For these reasons, only the TC-150M Multi-Band amplifiers are capable of fulfilling the Government’s requirements. This procurement is not set-aside for small business concerns. The associated NAICS code for this procurement is 334220 with a size standard of 750 employees. The reference number for this notice is N00421-06-T-0113. All inquiries should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Susan Supplee, via e-mail susan.supplee@navy.mil or via telephone at (301) 995-8899.  Interested parties may submit capability statements, by 15:30 Eastern Standard Time on 31 March 2006, via fax to (301) 995-8670 or via email to susan.supplee@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to solicit and negotiate a follow-on firm fixed price contract with Dynamic Instruments, Inc., 3860 Calle Fortunada, San Diego, CA 92123-1825, for ATABS Computer Indicator Power Supply (CIPS), Part Number (PN) 1576AS110-2 (CAGE 48171); instrument cover modification. This will include all technical documentations to replace the display, disk drive, and batteries inside the CIPS.

Dynamic Instruments, Inc. is considered the only responsible source since it is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to recover through competition. The ATABS/TABS is a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf single, self-contained, lightweight portable tracking, balancing, and vibration analyzer. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

*** This is a modification to a Presolicitation Notice posted on March 10, 2006.  This modification has been issued to change (1) the required square footage and (2) the response date for inquiries. ***

REQUIREMENT:

General Services Administration is interested in leasing 8,315 net rentable square feet, which will produce 7,230 ANSI/BOMA usable square feet.  The space will be occupied by the Social Security Administration.  

LEASE TERM:

15 years, 10 years firm.

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
Office space must be contiguous and located on the ground floor and on one level without being split by a public corridor or firewalls. Space offered must have potential for efficient layout.  Space should be located in a professional office setting and not within close proximity to residential areas.  The Government requires a fully serviced lease including 36 surface parking spaces.  All services, supplies, utilities, partitioning and tenant alterations are desired as part of the rental consideration.  For unimproved sites, the land should be of adequate size to accommodate separate employee and visitor parking and green space.  Public access is an important consideration.

Offered properties must be located within the city limits of Nacogdoches, Texas.  In keeping with Executive Order 1072, first consideration will be given to properties within the Central Business Area (CBA) as defined by the City of Nacogdoches, Texas. 

In accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act, General Services Administration (GSA) will consider whether the CBA provides adequate competition for the subject-leased space acquisition. GSA will consider other offered properties within the city limits, if space is not identified within the CBA, which can satisfy the requirements of the agency, or adequate competition is not available within the CBA.  The intent of this advertisement is to initiate a market survey, and to discover appropriate available properties within the Nacogdoches City Limits both inside and outside the CBA. 
 
ALL EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1.)	Building name and address
2.)	One-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered
3.)	Square footage offered

<DESC>Provide materials, workmanship and installation, including joints and fasteners that maintain continuity of RADIATION SHIELD DOOR at all points and in all directions specified in thicknesses and locations indicated.
1.	Materials, thicknesses, and configurations indicated are based on RADIATION SHIELD DOOR design prepared by Owner's radiation health physicist.  This design is available to SUBCONTRACTOR on request.
2.	A minimum of six (6) inches (30 cm) of Thermo Electron Corporation product Poly/Cast # 259 or equivalent encased in at least 1/2” carbon steel or stainless steel (A-36, 300 series stainless). The shield (door) shall overlap the sides of the entryway by approximately eight inches on each side and shall be as close as possible to the components mounted on the wall adjacent to the access.  The door is to be located at the equipment airlock door. If hinging the door is impractical due to anchorage or space requirements, the shield(s) can be on rollers and slide on the floor across the entryway opening. The shield shall be built such that in the closed position, it is as close to the floor as practical. The shield may be opened manually, motor driven, or both.  
3.	The existing blast door is to remain.  The shield door shall be designed and constructed so as to not interfere with the existing blast door assembly or working mechanisms.
4.	Doors must be capable of being unlatched and operable by one person.  The latch may be a mechanical type latch such as a surface mounted doorbolt.
5.	Temperature Requirements:  
a.	Doors must be fully operational at ambient temperatures from plus 55 degrees Fahrenheit to plus 95 degrees Fahrenheit.
6.	Electrical Requirements:
a.	All wiring connections as required, internal and external shall be made on labeled terminal blocks.   Terminal blocks shall be placed in NEMA 1 enclosures and located adjacent to the doors on the interior.  All wires shall be labeled.
b.	SUBCONTRACTOR shall provide a mounted tongue actuated safety interlock switch as manufactured by Allen-Bradley model number MT-GD-2.  The door shall be reinforced as necessary with a mounting plate to receive the interlock switch.   
c.	Door shall be grounded.  
d.	A power failure will not cause the door to change its lock/unlock state.  
7.	Hardware Requirements:  Door shall have hardware to provide a fully operational and functional door regardless of whether or not it is specified or shown on the drawings.
a.	Door stops:  Wall mounted door stops shall be provided at each door leaf, as required, to prevent the door or external accessory on the door from making contact with the adjacent walls or building accessory within the swing radius of the door leaf.  The design of the unit shall allow for the replacement of the rubber bumper.  Door frame stop shall be provided at head and jambs only.
b.	Hinges:  Hinges shall be designed to resist door reactions associated with normal and seismic loads.  They shall be designed to allow the door leaf to open approximately 135 degrees.
c.	Latch devices:  Latch devices shall ensure the door remains closed.
8.	Anchoring Requirements:  Doors shall be supported on the existing concrete wall with anchoring devices as designed by SUBCONTRACTOR including, but not limited to base plates, anchor bolts and anchors.  Reinforcing steel in the concrete walls may not be cut during installation of the anchor bolts for the door.  Anchoring designs must include the provision for a 2” tolerance on anchor bolt positions in any direction.  Attachment to existing blast door frames is not permitted.
9.	Seismic Requirements:  The door, anchors, and connections shall be designed to resist seismic loading.  Horizontal and vertical seismic forces shall act simultaneously on the door and frame.  Assume that excitation is applied along one of two orthogonal horizontal axes and is combined with the vertical direction.  Assume doors are open during a seismic incident.  For the purpose of seismic design for the doors, assume no other extraordinary forces are acting on the door at the same time.
a.	Design Basis Earthquake (DBE)
1)	General:  Door shall be designed to resist forces generated by the postulated DBE.
a)	Maximum Accelerations:
	East-West Direction = 0.41g
	North-South Direction = 0.40g
	Vertical Direction = 0.33g
b)	Directions are as indicated on reference drawings Paragraph 1.1.A
2)	Structural Response to DBE:  Limit the structural response of the door to prevent the door from falling off the hinges when in an open position.  Design the door such that all stresses remain elastic.  The door pins shall keep the door in place when closed.  The door does not need to remain operable; it is only to stay on the hinges.
10.	Interlocks:  
a.	General:
1)	Door shall be interlocked with criticality machines emergency safety shutdown system (SCRAM) to prevent execution of an experiment with the shield door open.
2)	Door shall have a status light which shall be energized when the door latch is in an unlocked position.
3)	Door interlock system shall not unlock the door upon loss of power.
QUALITY ASSURANCE
Manufacturer:
1.	The manufacturer shall have experience in the design, fabrication, and installation of doors similar to those as specified in this specification.
2.	The manufacturer shall have, and provide to the CONTRACTOR, an active Quality Assurance Plan which incorporates, as a minimum, the following elements of quality:

b.	Quality Assurance Program:  A documented Quality Assurance program shall be planned, implemented, and maintained.  The program shall provide control over activities affecting quality to an extent consistent with their importance.
c.	Design Control:  Procedures shall be established to assure the design conforms to the contact requirements.  The design adequacy shall be verified by persons other than those responsible for the design.
d.	Control of Processes:  Processes affecting quality of items or services shall be controlled.  Special processes that control or verify quality, such as those used in welding, heat treating, and non destructive examination, shall be performed by qualified personnel using qualified procedures in accordance with specified requirements.
e.	Inspection:  Inspections required to verify conformance of an item or activity to specified requirements shall be planned and executed.  Inspection checklists and results shall be documented.  Inspection records shall contain the following information as a minimum:

5)	Type of observation
6)	Results or acceptability
7)	Reference to information on action taken in connection with nonconformances.
f.	Control of Nonconforming Items:  Items that do not conform to specified requirements shall be controlled to prevent inadvertent installation or use.
g.	Corrective Action:   Conditions adverse to quality shall be identified promptly, documented, and corrected as soon as practical.  In the case of a significant condition adverse to quality, the cause of the condition shall be determined and corrective action taken to preclude recurrence.

Description

The Information Technology Center (ITC), under the direction of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, and Office of Chief Information Officer within the Department of Labor is requesting information for market research for a printer buying vehicle for its customer base. 

The ITC serves 23 DOL Agencies through the Employee Computer Network (ECN).  The ECN has approximately 3500 Local Area (LAN) connected networked desktops at the Washington DC and regional offices through-out the US.  Regional offices include approximately 800 remote access workstations.  Also, numerous employees have laptops for working off-site. Note that OASAM ECN has a decentralized budget for IT purchasing.

While the ITC maintains a certified list of printers, it has not formally consolidated nor standardized its printers.  In the past year, the ITC has encouraged customers, via internal market research efforts, to utilize the certification and recommended printer lists.  The environment has both network and local printers.  Approximately 300 of the environment’s printers are estimated to be networked, and the remaining printers are estimated to be local. 

Objectives
The ITC requires a range of printer hardware that can function on the OASAM ECN network, effectively serve large and small agencies, as well as meet the customers’ business requirements.  Hardware, peripherals, maintenance agreements, and minimal service related to customer requirements analysis may be required.   Assistance with an initial assessment may be also required.

ITC seeks to provide a streamlined and cost effective purchasing vehicle for its customer base to:
•	continuously improve its hardware to keep up with technological standards  
•	to reduce ITC maintenance costs and to reduce the hardware variability in the environment to obtain a more supportable customer base and lifecycle management
•	to better assist the customer in selecting the appropriate hardware for their business needs
•	to ensure that all hardware meets the minimum Section 508 requirements

Specifications and Requirements
Given the rapid change in the overall printer technology today and as the ITC transitions to increasingly complex technology, the following generally outlines the specifications required for the ITC.

•	The hardware must be able to accommodate advances in our infrastructure, cabling, communication lines and other network hardware.  The customer business requirements are presently under evaluation, but targets of 80 percent solution are desirable.
•	The hardware must be able to meet or be adaptable to Section 508 for disabled employees, as required.
•	On occasion, intermittent to high volume deployment of hardware to meet ECN customer demand, and shipping to regional or other off-site offices as requested
•	Regular updates on model upgrades, product discontinuations, or any shift in product technology that may will impact the ability to certify the product on the OASAM network, desktop compatibility, 508 requirements, and/or the customer’s ability to obtain supplies reasonably and at a cost effective price.
•	Evaluation units must be available
•	Considering the present decentralized purchasing environment, direct purchasing may be most apparent solution, however leasing will also be considered.

The USPS is currently seeking information on available technology and supply sources in the area of mail processing address reading technology that can provide products that function to the general specifications described in this notice.  The USPS has identified one supplier, RAF Technology, Inc., that fulfills the required technology and specifications and seeks to determine if other sources exist which meet the USPS requirements for the purpose of a potential competitive product/system evaluation.  If no other acceptable source can be located, a non competitive award may result.

The USPS is seeking to deploy mail reject encoding and processing machines (Reject Encoding Machine – REM) nationwide to automate the processing of Input Subsystem and Output Subsystem (ISS/OSS) rejects, Combined Input and Output Subsystem (CIOSS) Return to Sender (RTS) rejects, and loop mail.  The automated processing of the rejects shall result in manual hour savings nationwide.  The objective of this notice is to gather product information from current technology sources that can meet the requirements specified herein.  This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation to purchase equipment or services.  Information gathered through this announcement may be used to pre-qualify alternate sources for a potential competitive product evaluation at the USPS and the opportunity to submit a proposal for this solution.

The system description with performance data submission is to be provided to Mr. Tom Raspet, Purchasing and Supply Management Specialist, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Merrifield, VA, 22082-8150, Telephone (703) 280-7803 thomas.m.raspet@usps.gov, Requirements Specification Reject Encoding Machine (REM) Program.

Background

Optical scanning of mail pieces on the USPS sophisticated mail processing equipment results in a reject or non-read rate that require ten of thousands of man hours expended annually to manually process and reprocess such unreadable mail.  A REM system provides a solution for reading reject mail and for enhancing letter mail processing for mail with incorrect or damaged POSTNET barcodes.  Additional functionality includes the processing of Return to Sender (RTS) mail and Address Change Service (ACS) detection and holdout.

Technical Requirements

An acceptable REM system would be a simple, one operator, single pass, small footprint machine that performs many functions and is able to process mail up to 3/8" or better.  Its OCR system would enable it to encode rejects or the non-read letter mail from the ISS/OSS machines, Loop Mail and RTS mail.  It would utilize a camera and binarization system that produces ideal images for its advanced programmed algorithms.  The machine would apply a linerless label over the barcode clear zone, spray a correct POSTNET, verify the POSTNET, and sort for downstream local or destination processing.  It would print a human readable alpha-numeric stream using red ink, and update the Identification Code Sorting (ICS) file as needed.  The ISS and OSS encode, Finest Depth of Sort and error rates shall be in the range of 55% to 75%, 95% to 99% and 0.5% to 1.5% respectively.    It would have the capability to read and print 4State Barcodes, and separate ACS mail. The footprint shall not exceed 90 sq ft and the throughput shall exceed 10,000 pieces per hour.

Schedule & Deliverables

For purposes of this technology assessment and market survey, potential vendors shall provide REM system descriptions with performance data for USPS review.  This information should include a complete description of a working unit which substantiates the vendor’s ability to meet the technical requirements.  This written information shall be delivered to Mr. Tom Raspet (address noted above) no later than March 31, 2006.  Minor variations to the values expressed within the above technical requirements will be considered by the USPS if such systems are currently in use in other postal administrations or market applications.  In the event that a potential vendor currently has or plans to develop a system which will meet the requirements provided herein, such vendor must provide a date by April 03, 2006 when those development activities would be completed and their system be available for USPS review.  Following USPS review of the submitted REM system descriptions with performance data, a pre-qualification determination will be made and if appropriate competitive evaluation testing plans will be furnished.  The prequalified suppliers will be firms whose record of performance in the market place has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards.  The USPS will not provide funding for development activities associated with meeting the specified requirements.  Interested parties shall submit a total of three copies (two hard copy and one soft data copy) of any company promotional handouts, brochures, catalogs, technology performance specifications, and operations manuals of equipment that meets or exceeds these specifications and requirements to the address provided in this announcement.  Overly elaborate responses are neither expected nor required.  The USPS by issuance of this notice makes no commitment to the acquisition of any REM system technology.

<SUBJECT>Y -- BLANKET ORDERING AGREEMENT (BOA'S) MILITARY  INSTALLATIONS WITHIN THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DISTRICT OF CORPUS CHRISTI, KINGSVILLE, AND INGLESIDE, TX
<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms in the Texas district of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and San Antonio SBA Districts including participants with bona-fide places of business in either location.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of approximately fifteen (15) Blanket Ordering Agreement’s, (BOA’s).  The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year.  BOA’s are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices.  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order.  On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases, a design concept only, to the contractors for submission of a proposal.  If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary material, labor, equipment, and supervision required to perform the work within the specified time allotted to the BOA holders in the SBA Districts noted in this synopsis.  However, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000.    A project can be awarded in an amount less than $100,000.00 if all parties are in agreement.  The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Technical Approach and Price.   The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.  There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work.  Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks.  Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types.  EMERGENCY REPAIRS:  Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, and related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC and others.  MINOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS:  Miscellaneous exterior and interior renovations, fence, shelters, ramps, sidewalks, concrete work, installation or replacement of utilities, pipelines, and conduits, installation of miscellaneous electrical and mechanical devices, roof repairs, demolition projects, asphalt, painting, exterior and interior, ceiling repairs or modifications.  DESIGN:  On-site design solutions for emergency calls and Design/Build services for minor construction items.  The SIC/NAICS Codes covered under the BOA are for work performed in the NAICS Groups 233, 234, and 235 for construction.  GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE:  The BOA covers military installations within the SBA District of Corpus Christi, Kingsville and Ingleside, Texas.  The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years.  The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued.  SOLICITATIONS:  Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time.  ORDERS:  Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time.  Each order will be considered a separate binding contract.   LIMITATION OF ORDERS:  The average range will be from $100,000.00 to a maximum of $3,000,000.00.   A threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000.00.

<SUBJECT>B -- Streamlined A-76 Study of Personnel Processing Positions
<DESC>Pursuant to OMB Circular A-76, public notification was made on September 30, 2005 announcing a streamlined competitive study of the Personnel Processing functions. These functions are performed in the Human Resources Management offices in Laguna, CA, Dallas, TX, Burlington, VT and Washington, DC.  Upon further review of the personnel processing function, the Competitive Sourcing Official identified areas of anticipated growth within the function.  Workload changes will significantly impact the scope of the Requirements Document utilized in this streamlined competition.  Several factors were identified, including the FY06 legislative requirement to hire approximately 2,000 new Border Patrol Agents and increased shared services responsibilities within the Department of Homeland Security.   As a result of these and other factors, it is in the best interest of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency to convert and incorporate the functions of this streamlined competition into an impending standard competition for the Human Resources Management business unit.  This signifies the completion of this study.  In accordance with revised OMB Circular A-76, effective May 29, 2003, no party may contest any aspect of this streamlined competition.  Directly interested parties with questions must contact the Contracting Officer at the email address listed in the announcement.  Directly interested parties consists of only the Agency Tender Official and an individual appointed by a majority of directly affected employees as their agent.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Notice of Intent
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to award a non-competitive cooperative agreement to the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) for a Joint Quantum Institute (JQI).  The period of performance for this award is expected to be five years.  Funds will be obligated annually subject to availability of funds.  The NIST believes that the University of Maryland, College Park, is the only academic institution that meets the critical factors required for the collaborative research effort.  The critical factors include:

•	Distance between the academic institution and the NIST Gaithersburg campus.  A maximum distance of 50 miles was considered reasonable as that distance equates to a one hour or less commute time between NIST Gaithersburg and the facility for housing the Joint Quantum Institute.

•	The academic institution needs to have an established expertise in quantum information science that includes a strong component within its own Physics Department.

•	In addition to research programs in quantum information science, the academic institute needs to have an adequate supply of quality students.  The supply of graduate students should be sufficient to allow at least 2 students for each potential Fellow of this new institute.  The number of Fellows is estimated to be on the order of 25. 

•	All proposed research must be unclassified, thus the host institution must allow for an open research environment.

•	Permanent laboratory, office, and discussion space dedicated to the JQI.  

NIST plans to provide at least $2 million per year to support the broad infrastructure of the Joint Quantum Institute within 5 years (i.e. operating funds that support the research and administrative infrastructure of the institute but exclude salaries of NIST permanent scientific staff).  The host institution must contribute substantial resources to the partnership.
Interested organizations may submit capability statements and qualifications for the establishment of a Joint Quantum Institute.  This is solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to proceed to conduct this effort on a non-competitive basis.  A determination not to compete this proposed financial assistance relationship based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This is not a request for application, but a Notice of Intent to issue a non-competitive award.  No funding opportunity will be issued for this non-competitive requirement, and no other information will be provided.

<SUBJECT>R -- Accounting Support - Naval Engineering Supply Support System (NESSS)
<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center (ELC) intends to award a purchase order to Mr. Michael Ogrysko for accounting systems support for the depot, finance, procurement, and supply modules in the Naval Engineering Supply Support System (NESSS) for the U.S. Coast Guard YARD.  It has been determined in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) that negotiations will be conducted with only Mr. Michael Ogrysko.  The following Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is provided.  See Numbered Note 22.

Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC)

Coast Guard YARD NESSS Accounting Support


1) This is a Justification for other than full and open competition prepared by the YARD Acquisitions Branch, U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center.

2) It is intended to award a contract through other than full and open competition to Mr. Michael Ogrysko.  The contract shall include a base year and a one-year option period.

3) The U.S. Coast Guard YARD Fiscal Department requires accounting systems support for the depot, finance, procurement, and supply modules in the Naval Engineering Supply Support System (NESSS).  This support will include troubleshooting existing posting logic, recommending accounting solutions, changes, corrective actions and strategies, conduct system tests for NESSS programming changes, and assist in developing Coast Guard requirements definitions for the multi-year Coast Guard Logistics Transformation initiative.  Deliverables will consist of monthly progress meetings and summary reports of completed tasks, identified problems, recommended resolutions, outcome or mitigations of problems.  

4) This Justification and Approval is based upon the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”

5) The Yard accounting system is integrated into Yard job order system by way of the Naval Engineering Supply Support System (NESSS), which is a Coast Guard unique, custom and proprietary software application.  Maintenance of NESSS’ complex tables, matrixes, and transaction codes requires in depth knowledge of the system that cannot be found in the competitive marketplace.  Mr. Ogrysko’s executive experience in developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining NESSS accounting systems for over 7 years allows him to provide immediate value and impact to the Yard and ELC without the time delay of training.  It would not be possible for any supplier without existing knowledge of this unique and complex Coast Guard software to provide the immediate level of support required by the Yard. 

6) A notice is being published in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2., Synopsis of Proposed Contract Actions.

7) The Contracting Officer anticipates that the cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on market research of same or similar services, previous acquisitions, and current Department of Labor Wage Determination.

8) Based on the knowledge and skills required in order to support NESSS, which is a Coast Guard unique system, market research was not conducted.  Only someone with an in-depth knowledge of NESSS and its applications would be capable to provide the support required by this acquisition.  Mr. Ogrysko is the only known source at this time with the capability to provide these support services, having developed the system during his previous employment at the Coast Guard YARD.  

9) Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  It is essential that a contractor have the ability to proceed in providing support services without requiring training in the YARD’s NESSS accounting system.  Having developed, tested, and maintained the NESSS system for a significant time period, Mr. Ogrysko can provide immediate support services with the highest level of knowledge.  Maintenance and troubleshooting NESSS is critical to the continued success of NESSS to operate effectively and support the annual $68M Yard industrial operation, as well as the ELC logistics support operation.  Without this crucial support, routine and enhanced system maintenance will not be properly maintained, accounting, depot, and supply data accuracy will be compromised, and NESSS users will not be able to rely on the data in order to provide quality service to Yard customers.  Failure to properly maintain NESSS accounting systems will jeopardize the accuracy of required financial reports and inventory records and cause the Yard and ELC to fail to pass annual CFO Act financial audits, which will place the entire Coast Guard at severe risk of failing the annual audit.  This support is needed at a crucial time for the Coast Guard as the Yard begins the highly visible and critical 5-7 year Mission Effectiveness Project for the 210’ and 270’ legacy cutters as part of the Coast Guard Deepwater Program.  There are no other known sources with this capability. 


10) The following source is currently being considered:

	Mr. Michael Ogrysko, CPA
	6016 Forkwoods Road
	Baldwin, MD 21013-9307
	
11) This is a one-time requirement.  No subsequent procurements are planned.

12) TECHNICAL AND REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION REQUIRED BY FAR 6.303-1(b):

    I certify that the facts and representation under my cognizance which are included in    
    this justification, and which form a basis for this justification, are complete and
    accurate:

    Technical Cognizance:

I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<SUBJECT>A -- Manufacturing and Producibility Broad Agency Announcement
<DESC>The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to defend US deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack. As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability, modify and improve on existing technologies (commercial and dual-use) for insertion into BMDS Elements, and improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats. To investigate these technologies and technology insertion opportunities, MDA has established a Deputy for Engineering, Producibility (DEP) whose mission is to identify technology insertion candidates and open/modular systems applications that enhance producibility, quality and/or reliability, lower cost and reduce risk for all BMDS elements. 

The MDA/DEP seeks new and innovative concepts for individual projects improving the producibility, quality and reliability of: (1) Anti-Tamper/Software Protection; (2) Radar Systems – Antennas, Transmit/Receive Modules, Signal Processing, Optical Signal Processing, Thermal Management, RF Seekers; (3) Electro-Optical Systems - Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar, Focal Plane Arrays, High Energy Lasers, Beam Control; (4) Propulsion – Booster, Divert and Attitude Control Systems (DACS) (5) Materials Processing – Composite Structures, Thermal Management Materials, IR Windows; (6) Electronics - Wide Band Gap Materials and Devices, Radiation Hardened/Tolerant Electronics, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Data Links; (7) Power Systems – Batteries, Fuel Cells, Photovoltaic Arrays; (8) Software – application of COTS products to signal processing, middleware, operating systems, simulations and networking; and (9) Manufacturing Processes (supply chain management, obsolescence, and tin-whiskers). 

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary white paper (not to exceed five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA/MP program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities. Offerors that have been certified as a Small Business Concern should indicate that status on their submittal. Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .pdf file) to the point of contact listed below. White paper submissions should be marked appropriately if they contain proprietary or trade secret information. In addition, please advise the Government of any limitations on the Government’s rights in technical data, which might be provided in connection with the effort described in the white paper. 

The MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following criteria (weighed equally): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA/DEP program, to include maturity and level of risk; (2) the ability to develop and demonstrate near-term applications; (3) the offer’s capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM). Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35.016). This BAA will remain open until December 31, 2007. Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete. The Government may use selected support contractor and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement. These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Submission of white papers to this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgement and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process. MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards; however, if MDA does decides to pursue a concept, the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing. MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA. Any awards are anticipated to occur in FY 2006 through FY 2008. Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award) or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals submitted, or to select only part of an effort described in a proposal for award.

<SUBJECT>18 -- ADVANCED CONTROL MOMENT GYROS (CMGs) PROGRAM
<DESC>An industry briefing will be held at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) on April 4, 2006 from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., in Building 226, Auditorium.     The purpose is to discuss the general requirements and opportunities of the Advanced CMG Program. The goal of this program is to determine whether a generational leap of smaller and lighter Control Moment Gyros (CMGs) can be made by taking advantages of the ability to operate at higher speeds based on recent advances in (1) hybrid ball bearings, (2) advanced rotor materials, and (3) ironless armature motors.  Additionally, to be viable these advanced CMGs should exhibit minimal induced vibration.  Therefore, the scope of this program is to develop, build, and test the technologies required to create the next generation of Control Moment Gyros (CMGs) that are mass, volume, and induced vibration optimized. The program hopes to enable the insertion of these new CMG designs into future spacecraft by taking the level of development to the point that it could be deployed by new or existing programs while not subjecting those programs to unnecessary cost, technical and schedule risk. As such, the general requirements for a space qualifiable advanced CMG, along with related contract opportunities and mechanisms will be discussed.  A combination of contracting methods will be used to support the innovative systems required for this effort.     The NRL Broad Agency Announcement topic number BAA 82-05-01, Spacecraft Technology may be used to submit initial "white papers" to NRL for consideration of advanced CMG designs for this program.   Potential advanced CMG sources are encouraged to attend the industry day to facilitate the communication process.     The complete description of the topic can be located at the following website: http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/baa.htm .  Offerors who plan to attend must submit a visit request by March 31, 2006: Naval Research Laboratory, Attn: Code 3230 MS, Industry Briefing MS03, 4555 Overlook Avenue S.W, Washington, D.C. 20375.

–	Technical Objective:  A requirement exists to grind hydraulic actuator cylinders as part of depot overhaul, prior to coating them with either chrome or High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF).  Grinding typically consists of grinding the base material (300M), chrome, and tungsten carbide HVOF, typically removing .0005 to .005 inches.  Hydraulic actuators are long thin tubes that are susceptible to bending during the grinding process.  The depot wants to automate the process to grind the cylinders at a faster rate without bending the cylinders.  This affects the grinding process used on most hydraulic actuators, landing gear components, and a variety of other parts and materials.  An automated grinding process would allow parts to be ground considerably faster with less human errors.

Technical Objectives:
 
a.  Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) needs a tailored Image Mapping Software Module for its recently refurbished Nose Radome Electrical Test Station (NRETS).  This software module should generate a computerized 3-D surface map that clearly identifies locations on the radome where tuning tape needs to be applied to bring the radome electrical characteristics into specification.  This software module should utilize an open systems architecture approach for test equipment interface and allow programmer modifications by use of a drop-down window menu.  In addition, a color coded graphical plot map (with reference coordinates) should be used to graphically display tuning locations and have the ability to be easily displayed using commercially available off-the-shelf software.  This effort must be implemented in a depot production environment within 12-18 months.
b.  OO-ALC Radome Repair Facility is in need of a radome repair process that provides a high degree of confidence so that when a radome leaves the repair cell for the test facility, it will not be returned to the repair cell for rework.  Currently, the process requires removing exterior coatings and primers repairing any defects and then replacing the coatings.  This process requires significant handwork that regularly changes the ideal shape of the radome that in turn impacts the radio frequency optics.  These process-induced defects cannot be detected until the radome is tested on a radar test stand.  This leaves us with a very low degree of confidence that the radome will be able to be tuned in a timely manner.  (Note:  In the last few years there has been a number of, non-contact, 3-D dimensional measurement processes developed.  These systems include but are not limited to Laser Radar, Accordion Fringe Interferometry, and White Light Optics.  These imaging devices can generate 3-D point cloud of the surfaces that are accurate to half a thousand of an inch.  The solution would be to use one of these 3-D imaging devices in conjunction with software to compare an ideal surface with the existing as measured surface and could display the difference as a color gradient that could be worked and updated in real-time.  This would give OO-ALC a repeatable repair process with a high degree of confidence that repairs are ready for Far Field Test.)

-  Technical Objective:  
Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center needs a system to identify electrical and mechanical defects during composites repair of aircraft radomes.  The solution should satisfy requirements outlined below and utilize state-of-the-art technologies that are mature and can be fully implemented within a depot production environment within 12-18 months.

a.  Hardware to scan aircraft radomes and collect two-horn interferometer data in order to generate a high-resolution electrical map of radome properties.  In particular, transmission efficiency and insertion phase delay are of interest; however, reflected phase and other measurements could also provide useful data.  Coupled with this requirement is a software package to integrate the high-resolution data into a format that can be directly compared to present Far-Field Range (FFR) test tolerances and results.

b. A Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) method for detection of mechanically based defects in composite aircraft radome parts.  These mechanical defects would include moisture, delaminations, voids, crushed core and resin fill.  The system should either be point-of-use or include a graphical interface for identifying the location of the defects in the part and have the ability to provide output data formatted as a map that can be used for repair.

No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of a response to this notice.  

DUE:  Written responses to this RFI synopsis should be submitted no later than fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.

Technical Point of Contact (POC):  Matthew Larger, phone (937) 255-7210 ext. 3710, email: Matthew.Larger@wpafb.af.mil.

DESC:  RFI for sealant removal methods, POC:  Noelle Spalding, CONTRACT NEGOTIATOR, phone (937) 255-3385 ext. 3108, email: Noelle.Spalding@wpafb.af.mil; Larry Doelker, CONTRACTING OFFICER, phone (937) 255-7210 ext. 3810, email: lawrence.Doelker@wpafb.af.mil.  (This is not a Research and Development [R&D] announcement).  

„o	Technical Objective:  The current Air Force method of removing damaged/old sealant from fuel cells is primarily with plastic scrapers, which is man-hour intensive.  A requirement exists for new methods that are explosion-proof, spark-proof, can be used in enclosed fuel cells and/or around fuel vapors safely, and will significantly reduce man-hours spent removing old sealant.  Potential solutions could include new chemical processes or powered tools designed to remove sealant safely.

Interested companies must submit a capabilities statement for each concept not to exceed ten (10) pages per concept.  A brief summary is all that is needed versus a detailed proposal.  If more information is necessary, you will be contacted.  (NOTE:  Format is 12 pt font, single-spaced, 
1-inch margins, no ALL CAPS).  Capabilities statements must provide the following information:

1.  Cross-Cutting (Multi-Platform) Applicability:  List USAF aircraft to which this concept will apply and how. 

2.  POCs:  Include name, company name, phone number, e-mail address, and mailing address for the subject matter expert for each concept. 

3.  Concept Objective and Approach:  Provide reference to the specific aging aircraft requirement and number (listed and attached to this synopsis) this concept is addressing.  Describe how the concept will resolve the issue. 

4.  Implementation Costs/Strategy:  Provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM). Describe actions necessary to put the product into the users¡¦ hands.  This should include transition/implementation costs, training, maintenance planning, etc.  Also provide a year-by-year breakout of development and transition costs associated with the concept.

5.  Concept Benefits:  Explain how the Air Force will benefit from using this concept. The benefit can be qualitative as well as quantitative.  Suggested explanations can take the form of
a) Best estimate for return on investment (ROI), along with the payback period if attainable at current stage of concept development (identify cost avoidance and savings separately, as applicable), b) Improvement to aircraft availability (mission capable rate [%], percentage depot throughput [%], maintenance man-hours [time or %]); and, c) Reduction in risk to safety (e.g. MIL-STD-882D). 

6.  Background Research:  Synopsize previous efforts that have led to the current state of the concept.  The proposed concept should be at least a system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. 

7.  Deliverables and Targeted User:  Describe the deliverables (hardware, software, prototype, process/procedures, analysis/modification tools, equipment, manuals, tech orders changes, etc.) the user will receive and include the expected timeframe/schedule.  Describe the intended user (depot maintenance, field maintenance, depot engineer, long-range planner, etc.).

8.  Collaborations and Partnerships:  Please identify the major organizations participating in the concept. 

9.  Indicate similar/preliminary work already underway.

 The USCG Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN) Portsmouth has a requirement to purchase: A total of 120 each Beacon Signal Generator.

  1200-SMSK-PIVIAFE Digital Global Position System (DGPS) Beacon Signal Generator

The 1200~SMSK-PMAFE is the signal generation module of the MR-1O1 enhanced DGPS medium frequency data modulator. This module accepts signals from a DSP card PMAFE interface and generates a Shaped MSK modulated data at user selectable data rates and carrier frequency. The 1200-SMSK-PMAFE timing is based on either an internal or an external 10 MHz frequency reference that may be both time and frequency synchronized to an external One-PPS pulse from GPS. The l200-SMSK-PMAFE is designed to operate with a companion DSP card, for example, the Momentum Data Systems HAWK89 board, hosted on a PC PCI bus. This combination permits control of the modulation process and the generation of the desired data message.

To permit immediate testing of the 1200-SMSK-PMAFE, the cards are shipped with SMSK modulator test software. This Windows® based program generates a phase modulated carrier using standard RTCM SC 104 formatted 6-of-8 formatted messages or fixed internally generated test messages. 

1200-SMSK-PMAFE specifications when interfaced with the HA WK89 DSP card (MRD-101) and CEI control software

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  Line Item 0001: The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, Two-Dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry System (2D PIV).

Background
The velocity measuring system will be used to determine flow fields at the inlet and exit regions of various finned tube heat exchangers.  The inlet air velocity is normally assumed to be uniform across the face of the heat exchanger.  However, a non-uniform air velocity profile is prevalent in field installations, and a NIST laboratory study indicated that non-uniform air distribution may degrade coil heat transfer by as much as 30 percent.  

The issue of non-uniform air distribution has not been popular in discussions because measuring the air velocity profile is cumbersome and time-consuming.  Since some replacement heat exchangers are often larger than the original, the replacement heat exchanger’s front surface is typically at a sharper angle with respect to the flow direction.  In such a case, the air velocity profile is substantially different, and coil heat transfer ability is degraded.

This Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) System shall measure and allow visualization of air velocity distributions for three common finned-tube heat exchanger configurations: a single-slab, A-shaped slabs, and V-shaped slabs.  NIST shall make detailed air velocity measurements, which shall be validated by hot wire anemometry and the air-tunnel apparatus prescribed in ASHRAE Standard 51.  

Specifications

The system shall be capable of measuring air velocity in two spatial dimensions (2D) simultaneously by applying the technique of Particle Image Velocimetry with a single digital camera.  

The system must consist of a CCD camera, camera lenses, camera filters, and camera mounts; image frame grabbers, timing and synchronization units, and system software.  The system must be compact (no single component weighing more than 23 kg (50 lb)) and portable for operation in an industrial type environment.  

The system must be capable of measuring particle displacements on the order of 1 mm – 10 mm for a 1 m x 1 m field of view with a standard uncertainty of plus/minus 1 percent or less.  The system must measure the gas velocity through an opening of size 1 m x 1 m and agree with independent measurements using a different technique (such as hot wire anemometry) to within plus/minus 5 percent.  

CCD Camera Package
•	Minimum Resolution of 1300 x 1024 pixels
•	Monochrome or color
•	Double frame mode for sampling at intervals of 600 nanoseconds and larger  
•	Fast readout of up to 30 frames/second
•	At least 12 bit image depth

Framegrabber and programmable timing hardware interfaced to a PC using a PCI or faster interface.   
•	Additional programmable IO channels to control light source (laser timing)
•	Programmable IO for future expansion
•	Room to accommodate a three dimensional system (2 cameras) in the future
•	Must have the ability to time and control a dual cavity pulsed laser within the programmable timing hardware

Image acquisition and processing software
•	Image filtering
•	Background subtraction
•	Data import/export control
•	Camera, timing unit, and all hardware control from this software
•	Image visualization
•	Image organization into projects/notebooks

Image processing software shall include
•	Cross correlation and auto correlation algorithms with spatial resolution as good or better than the camera pixel count within the defined area 
•	Second order correlation and deformed window correlation of images
•	Image Vector field displays in several formats
•	Advanced image “cleanup” tools to remove unwanted interference or background “noise” from the captured images.

Objective:   To obtain fully contractor operated and maintained Type I air attack services in support of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Aerial Task Force (ATF) Due to the extraordinarily high fire danger in the Southwestern United States and the anticipated severe fire season, the BLM is assembling an Aerial Task Force to be available for rapid respond to multiple fires. The ATF will consist of three Single Engine Attack Tankers (SEATs) in addition to this air attack aircraft. The ATF will be used for a sixty day period, April 1, 2006 through May 30, 2006 with an option to extend services as provided under the Terms and Conditions below. The ATF will not be assigned to a designated base, but will report to and be released from Phoenix, AZ. No payment will be made for mobilization to and from Phoenix, AZ. Once contractor reports to Phoenix, AZ, subsistence, availability, and flight time will be paid for the duration of this agreement. The BLM will determine the locations where the ATF will be dispatched, based upon current fire conditions. We anticipate the ATF being dispatched to areas with the most critical fire activity/conditions. 2. Terms and Conditions a.	Aircraft Rental Agreement (ARA) The resulting contract will be awarded by the issuance of a modification to the operator's Aircraft Rental Agreement.  Terms and conditions for that agreement including all of Supplement 15 Type I Air Attack, shall apply unless otherwise specified herein.

Mutual Extension of Exclusive Use Period Upon mutual agreement by the parties, the CO will modify the contract to extend the exclusive use period on a day-to-day basis, either prior to the established starting date or subsequent to the ending date. The contract terms, conditions, specifications and prices shall apply to such extension. d.	Daily Availability During the exclusive use period and any extension, the Contractor shall be in compliance with all contract requirements and available and capable of providing service up to 14 hours each day, as scheduled by the Government.  Personnel shall be available a minimum of nine hours each day, or as scheduled by the Government.  Pre- and post-flight activities shall be accomplished within the 14- hour duty day.  Routine maintenance shall be performed before or after the scheduled 14-hour period, or as permitted elsewhere in the contract.

Payment will be reduced for each hour, or portion thereof in accordance with the Unavailability Conversion Chart Exhibit when services are unavailable or when the aircraft has been released for the Contractor's benefit.   e.	Unavailability and Damages  The contractor will be unavailable when not in compliance with all contract requirements, or is not capable of providing service as scheduled by the government. Unavailability will continue until the contractor has notified the COR that they are available.    During periods of unavailability, the Government may obtain replacement services elsewhere and charge the Contractor for any resulting excess costs.

<DESC>In response to the question received on 3/15/2006:
 
Section 3.1.3.9 - 
Is the Navy providing a GPS timing signal via IRIG to the DVLRS or does the vendor need to generate this signal?
  

 
The Navy provides satellite timing.  The ship's NAVSSI subsystem or AN/WRN-6(V) Satellite Radio Set is commonly used, however there are some functional equivalent receivers in use.  The NAVSSI, navigation receiver, or its equivalent will be the origin of the time synchronization signal used by the DVLRS, and in most cases, the havequick format is used.

<DESC>AMEND 2

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE AMENDED ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS:

ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM HAS ADDED:

5.     Vendor shall include and install biometric overrides at each of the locked portals, such that designated personnel can enter and/or exit during an alarm condition. Override occurrences shall be recorded by an ISS component.
6.     System shall include a manual switch/pushbutton at each nurses station in the North, East, and West wings to override the securing mechanisms for that wing. 

AREA OF COVERAGE NOW READS: 

1. Security system coverage shall be determined by technical schematics .
2. Workstations shall be placed as designated by MTF. There shall be 6 workstations, (1 NICU#1, 1 NICU#2, 1 L&D, 1 Three North, 1 Three East, 1 Security Office) 
3. ISS Devices: Provide sufficient receivers and exciters to completely cover the designated space, and to meet requirements of the drawings and specifications. (The designated space does not include the staff locker rooms.) The contractor shall ensure the installation of a complete system, using equipment and software to provide the required coverage and functionality, whether or not specifically noted on the available drawings.

WORKMANSHIP HAS ADDED: 

7.     NMCSD is not subject to regulatory control by the city, county, or state with respect to construction. Construction material disposal containers exterior to the medical center are coordinated with the facilities manager. 
8.     Upon completion of installation, contractor shall remove the previous system, including any wiring. Conduits can be reused, or abandoned, but any firewall penetrations shall be sealed.

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE REVISIONS TO THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS, THE FOLLOWING ARE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

1.	On the map, there is still confusion as to the locker room area in the OB Surgery and Laboratories section. Is the intent to secure the doors with available resources and allow access only to personnel with need to access? This is the access path to the South passage (Catwalk to Bldg 3). This could be included in the area of coverage by installing an alarm sensor at the intersection of the catwalk and the back of the Lab area. Please clarify.

ANS: Locker rooms are already secured by NMCSD. Only NICU & FAU personnel have access to that area. Sensors shall cover the main hallway with the windows, before and after the automated doors. 

2.	In the service elevator room/hallway (central triangle area), there are 2 elevators and 6 entrance ways into that area. Does NMCSD wish to secure the six normal doors with lock and key method? Or does NMCSD intend that vendor secure the elevator doors with their installed system? 

ANS: (see answer as part of question 3)

3.	In the same service elevator area, is an alarm sensor be added to cover the access to the elevators? If vendors secure the elevator doors, would the Automatic robot cleaning device that uses those elevators interact/override the door locks? 

ANS: NMCSD does not require locking the doors on the service elevators. Therefore, an alarm sensor that shall alarm if a protected infant enters the lobby area of the service elevators is required. Additionally, a camera is required in the area.

4.	We wish to know if the distance for alarm sensors to engage door locks should be 10 feet from the doors on the inside of the wings. Is this acceptable? (If Nuisance alarms are anticipated, a Do-not-pass line could be applied to the floor at the 10-foot boundary.)

ANS: The offeror shall determine the best means and distance of providing the desired result based upon the design of their system. Nuisance alarms are a concern, therefore a means to minimize them are the responsibility of the offeror.

5.	Installers Wages: is this a Prevailing Wage Project? And if so, please send us the rates to be used.

ANS: Wage parameters are not set by this solicitation, or by the resultant contract. This is for the purchase of the ISS Equipment, the installation is incidental. Winning bidder must comply with local, state, and Federal regulations regarding wages.

6.	Provide Bidders List. 

ANS:  Once vendors submit a bid, their identity is protected as procurement sensitive.

7.	Please send Full Size Copy of Floor Plans for 3rd Floor Infant Area for both bidding & asbuilts.

ANS: Floor plans are available as PDF files, these drawings are only floor plans, and do not contain any of the information normally found in architectural drawings. The PDF files are available upon request by emailing rtaylor@nmlc.med.navy.mil. Only CCR registered companies will be granted access to these files.

8.	Confirm installation - Cabling above ceilings & floors can be Plenum rated, exposed areas to either be EMT Conduit or Wire Mold

ANS: The walls of the third floor are plasterboard and metal studs. Installation of wiring/conduit on the exterior of the walls is not acceptable. PLENUM rated cables are acceptable where regulations and codes permit. Wires that run down must be encased in conduit.

9.	Existing Security System: Provide the company names who installed the existing system & if there are items to be reused such as door holders, cameras, sensors, keypads etc. I wish to have model numbers / cut sheets. I wish to have Equipment Submittals, & existing asbuilts, this may help to save money on the installation for the Owner.

ANS: CEI (Construction Electronics, Inc.) and RFT (RF Technologies, Inc.) are incumbent contractors for the existing system. See answer 48 for details. Model numbers/ cut sheets are not available. All existing equipment (cameras, doors, etc.) is the property of the government and can be reused if it is in accordance with FAR 52.211-5 (e), with government approval. Materials/equipment must be of New, Reconditioned, or Remanufactured condition. 52.211-5 -- Material Requirements. http://www.arnet.gov/far/ 

10.	Confirm that where existing CPU Server on 3rd Floor, Janitors Closet, that this room can be used to mount New Security Equipment. From there vendor can use the existing LAN for communications from our new panels to New Monitor Station / Server at the 1st Floor Security Room.

ANS: Janitor closet mentioned is a wet area, it is strongly suggested that another location would be more appropriate to locate electronic components. It is recommended that the utility closet on 3 East, room number 3R-R3.2 be used. The ward clerk has direct line of sight on this room and it is located right next to the unit LPO's office.

11.	Confirm New Door Sensors at the new door locations to work within a 10 ft radius of the doors.

ANS: Door sensors shall operate so as to comply with the requirements of the solicitation.

12.	Are there going to be Security Cameras in the elevators?

ANS: Not as part of the Infant Security System install.

13.	Need sequence of operation of security door locks at new door locations (double doors) how do you want them to interface with existing fire alarm MAG door holders?

ANS: ISS installation must interface with the fire protection system and comply with the NFPA Codes. All interfaces with the Fire Protection System would be designed by the ISS contractor, approved by NMCSD Facilities Management and NAVFAC Fire Protection Engineers, installed and tested by the ISS Vendor. The offeror shall propose a solution that meets both sets of requirements.

14.	Confirm the quantities of work stations, door locks, cameras, alarm sensors & exciters shown on the map given to us on the job walk 1/10/2006.

ANS:     NMCSD requires work stations in the following areas: 
NICU 1 - 1; NICU 2 - 1; L&D (3 West) - 1; 3North - 1; 3East - 1; Security office - 1
Total of 6 security stations in total.     
Door locks -     There shall be sufficient door securing devices to cover all the egress points of the secure area. The information is the responsibility of the offeror to determine based upon the drawings available/provided of the area. 
Number of cameras and camera placement - There shall be sufficient cameras to cover all the egress points of the secure area. The information is the responsibility of the offeror to determine based upon drawings available/provided of the area. The camera placement shall comply with the Essential Characteristics as posted in N62645-R-06-1009.
Alarm sensors - There shall be sufficient alarm sensors to cover all the egress points of the secure area. The information is the responsibility of the offeror to determine based upon the drawings available/provided of the area. Alarm sensors shall be placed in designated third floor elevator lobbies.
Exciters - There shall be sufficient exciters to cover the entire square footage of the secure area without any dead zones. The information is the responsibility of the offeror to determine based upon the drawings available/provided of the area. 

15.	Vendors need clarification on the different elevator rooms that we are to protect. 

a.       It is stated in section marked Access Control System point 1 {The ISS shall lock all designated exit portals, including elevators, if protected infant is removed from the designated areas. (The ISS shall only lock a specific location and not the entire ISS-protected wing.)}

b.       Then in the same section point 4 it states {Doors and elevator doors shall be securable by the system, the elevator operation between the non-protected floors shall not be hindered by the alarm; only the protected door(s) leading to each elevator from the protected area shall not open.}

c.       Which doors need to be clarified. There are sections that have elevators that have no door leading into the area so they cannot be locked to protect the elevators and other area that have too many doors leading into the area which would make it cost prohibitive to protect.

ANS:     In response to (a, b, c), in the protected area of 3rd floor, vendors need to prevent access to the patient elevators and secure designated exit doors. NO ELEVATORS CARS SHALL BE PREVENTED FROM NORMAL OPERATION MOVING AMONG THE NON-PROTECTED FLOORS. OUTER DOORS OF EACH ELEVATOR IN THE PROTECTED AREA WHERE ALARM ACTIVATES SHALL BE SECURED ON THE PATIENT ELEVATORS ON THE THIRD FLOOR. The service elevators do not require securing, only monitored with alarm sensor and camera in the 3rd floor service elevator lobby area.

16.	The following describes the 3 ways an elevator can be protected (Vendor Comments): 

a.       1 - Bank style control, which, if a tag enters the area in front lobby area of the elevators which are protected, the system will see it and enter into alarm instantly and can or will control the elevator cars (dependant on what the elevators are capable of) by either locking the elevator(s) down if they are on the floor or bypassing the floor if they are not on the floor. This requires 1 controller per bank of elevators
b. 2 - Individual Elevator Control by Car, which, is mounted around or at each elevator individually and when a tag is detected and the door to the elevator is open the alarm would sound and the car would lock in place (dependant on what the elevators are capable of). This requires a controller per car being protected.
c.       3 - Individual Elevator Control by Car, which, is similar to above with the exception a controlling device is mounted on top of each car, which rides the car from the basement to the roof and will detect when a tag enters the car and it will lock only that car down, not affecting the other cars. You will require one device per elevator car

ANS:    None of the above. The movement of the elevator cars shall NOT be hindered, Vendor shall provide a means for securing/locking the doors from opening on the third floor main patient elevators. Do not take control of the elevators, vendors shall secure the doors.

17.	All of these ways of controlling the elevators would require a tie in with the elevator company in either just controlling the door hold open on the car or a full mounting and installation on the car. We will all need clarification on how you would like the elevators controlled.

ANS: See answers to 15 and 16.

18.	Under ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM, Item 4, the statement is made that "Doors and elevator doors shall be securable by the system, the elevator operation between the non-protected floors shall not be hindered by the alarm; only the protected door(s) leading to each elevator from the protected area shall not open."

ANS: Do not lock the elevators down. If a sensor tag enters the prescribed area near the door, the protected door(s) shall secure and the alarm shall activate.

19.	 Is the sophisticated Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) system integrated closely with the operational control of the service elevators, including elevator door operation. 

a.       Is it your intent to integrate the Infant Security System with this sophisticated AGV/service elevator control system? 
b.       If so, will preventing the protected elevator door from opening adversely affect AGV system operation?

ANS: In response to (a and b), in the central area of 3rd floor, do not interface the ISS with the AGV. These are service elevators and do NOT require securing devices.

20.	Clarify how you would like vendors to handle security protection for the service elevator bay.

ANS: Protect the perimeter with an alarm sensor that would detect if a sensor entered the lobby area.

21.	Who is the elevator maintenance company and what is their contact information? 

ANS: Current elevator service company - Chugach McKinley is the current Prime Contractor for elevator maintenance.  The contact number is (619) 234-0552.

22.	Please define the elevator coverage. To appropriately cover the service elevators, the hospital should either have all 6 exits points covered (very costly) or have one controller in the area that will allow the elevators to bypass the floor if a tag is in the field, or at least alarm if the tag is in the field. Another option would be to have individual elevator controls. If a tag enters an elevator car, there would be a warning sound. If the tag does not exit the car, an alarm will sound in 10 seconds and the door remains locked open until reset. The other car would still be operational unless a tag enters that one. 

ANS: See answers 15-20.

23.	Where do you want the monitor for elevators, elevator lobby area or within the elevator?
       
ANS: Vendor shall place the exciters in the hallway/lobby before the elevators.

24.	Where do you want the monitor for service elevators, elevator lobby area or within the elevator?

ANS: Service elevator lobby area.

25.	Is the winning bidder required to remove the existing infant security system as part of there bid and if so to what extent do you want the system removed (all wiring in the ceiling, all controllers, receivers, keypads on walls and existing computers if applicable), also any holes or damage to walls that is necessary when the removal occurs, is that to be patched and fixed by the facility itself or is Vendor required to do this.

ANS: Yes, the winning vendor shall ensure that existing system components are removed and that any new fire or smoke barrier penetrations are sealed as specified in the solicitation. All fire or smoke barrier penetrations created or caused by removal of the old system cables, conduit, or components shall be sealed by the winning vendor. No wiring shall be abandoned in place. Vendor shall follow Workmanship characteristics for post-installation condition and appearance.

26.	Please define the birth census at the facility? It was noted that is was between 250 & 300 births per month and that you would require 90 tags? please confirm.

ANS: 300 per month

27.	How many tags, and of what type (i.e. infant, mother, pediatric, etc.), are required?

ANS: only infant - 90 tags

28.	As dust containment is a requirement for this installation please forward the NMCSD Infection Control Policy regarding dust containment. As discussed, it may only be needed in the patient wards. Define your requirements per wards and hallways.

ANS: See posted Infection control documents in FBO (as amendment) and use with PDF files.

29.	Are there any areas with asbestos to be concerned about and if so who will be doing the abatement? Will the facility have this done or will you require vendor to issue a quotation for it?

ANS: The only known asbestos is in the mastics used for flooring and coving.

30.	You have stated that we are required to complete and submit a copy of forms: Provision FAR 52.213-3 and DFARS 252.212-7000 and others, where do we get these forms? Is there a web site that we can go to, to obtain them? 

ANS: http://www.arnet.gov/far/

31.	Question for staff training, how many personnel will be requiring training for the healthcare staff, security staff, maintenance, facilities, housekeeping and any other staff you may require? We need this to determine days of training required.

ANS: NURSING: There are two 12 hr shifts (days and nights)? vendor can catch majority of staff if training days are held on Tues and Thurs. NMCSD has 4 different units to train? NICU (60 staff), L&D (60 staff), 3E (30 staff), 3N (40 staff)

32.	How many doors need to be protected in the OB Surgery area? There was a question as to whether or not there was a door that leads out of the locker room.

ANS: That door is cover by the FACU staff. It leads directly to the nursing station, which is continuously manned. OB has one back south exit, one exit/entrance to FAU, one exit/entrance to PACU, and the main double door entrance/exit (a total of 4 doors in all).

33.	Please supply floor plans and current specs for cameras. Can camera system for the third floor be independent of the other hospital cameras, or do they need to integrate?

ANS: There are no specifications in addition to those provided by the solicitation. This is a performance specification, and the offeror is expected to propose a solution based upon available technology. ISS cameras are independent from other hospital cameras.

34.	 Can you please give me the minimum requirements of the DVR and Cameras?
a. For instance: How many days of recording, frames per second. Lux on the camera, TV Lines etc.

ANS: This is a performance specification, and the offeror is expected to propose a solution based upon available technology.

37.	What brand of camera and recording device is required?

ANS: No brand specified.

38.	Will the hospital still supply the 110 VAC at each exit point to power the controllers or will we be utilizing the existing closets the current system are residing in?

ANS: The successful vendor shall install all electrical conduit/wiring. Facilities will work with the contractor to identify the electrical panels to which they can connect for electrical power.

39.	Where can we obtain information regarding local permit fees?

ANS: The NMCSD is not subject to local or state permit requirements. However, this does not exempt an employer from complying with applicable state and local laws (taxes, occupational health and safety, etc.).

40.	Question: The drawing you sent has a large {X} across the left side. Does this mean that this section is deleted from the scope of work?

ANS: No, the {X} was a scribbled note. No change to SOW.

41.	How we are to become CCR registered? 

ANS: You may become CCR registered by visiting www.ccr.gov and following the instructions online. You shall need a DUNS number to get started, that information is also available on CCR. It is recommended registering online, rather than by phone. 

You must be CCR registered before a government contract can be awarded and in order to get paid.

42.	Where can we locate the NMCSD Infection Control Policy regarding dust containment?

ANS: See Question 28.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE (SEM).  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment No. 3 is to provide answers to questions submitted in response to NNC06149224Q for the SEM.  The questions and answers are as follows: 1. Does your end user wish to do light elements down to B or only to Na? Answer: Down to and including B. 2. Is your end user familiar with the new solid state SDD detectors that do not require liquid nitrogen, have the same resolution as SiLi, are capable of outputs of over 250,000 counts per second and since they only need to go to -15C can be turned on when needed and off when not?  Would the end user consider such a detector? Answer: SDD technology is still too new to determine long-term reliability.  End user prefers to use a liquid nitrogen cooled detector.   3. Is X-ray excitation critical to your application? Answer: No.  NASA end user mistakenly interchanged the acronyms EDS and XRF in the original specs.   All that is required is energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) utilizing x-rays that are emitted from the sample during bombardment by the electron beam to characterize the elemental composition of the analyzed volume.  An optional x-ray tube is not desired.   The due date for receipt of offers is hereby extended to March 24, 2006 at 4:30 PM. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on March 14, 2006. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
