<DESC>Please Note - Receipt of Proposals is hereby extended to July 26, 2002.  Additional Information shall be provided during the week of July 1 on the Fedbizopps.  The Food and Drug Administration?s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research?s (CDER) Office of Pediatric Drug Development and Program Initiatives (OPPDI), in conjunction with FDA?s Office of Women?s Health, are writing a contract to support research on infant outcomes and/or maternal effects in pregnant women exposed to certain pharmaceuticals, which could be used to treat diseases or conditions resulting from a terrorist attack. The nation?s recent experience with bioterrorism has demonstrated that in the event of a terrorist attack it will be necessary to treat pregnant women with pharmaceutical agents for diseases or conditions that might otherwise be fatal.  However, little is known about the safety of most drugs either to the woman or to her developing fetus when used during pregnancy. The objectives of the contracted research will be to develop information on infant outcomes and/or maternal effects in a cohort of women exposed to a drug of interest during pregnancy using large automated healthcare data systems data.  The highest priority is to evaluate infant outcomes; however, a specific contract could also include a component to assess maternal effects of the drug during pregnancy.  Also, a specific contract could study one or more drugs of interest. The contract shall have an eighteen-month basic period of performance. All responsible organizations may submit an offer in response to the solicitation. (NOTE:  Guidelines will be provided with the solicitation.)  This is a new contract (Contract Number 223-02-3003). The Request for Proposal (RFP) will only be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Prospective offers are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of the solicitation and amendments. The RFP should be available for downloading on/about fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement.  This requirement will be a full and open competitive requirement.  The FDA reserves the right to award without discussions.

<DESC>DESC:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The National Environmental Satellite, Data and  Information Services (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking potential sources to provide the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery.   The information received will be used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its affiliated U.S. Government (USG) agencies, such as the U.S. Navy,  to assess the availability of sources for commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery for the remainder of 2002 and beyond.

All responsible sources are invited to submit a description of their capabilities and experience.  State whether large, small or disadvantaged business concern.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 514199 applies.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this request. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with information submitted in response to this request.   

NOAA and the U.S. Navy conduct numerous operational programs for which SAR data provides mission critical information.  These data are required for monitoring environmental conditions in oceans, coastal regions, lakes and rivers, and for other areas of interest worldwide, including the monitoring of natural and human-induced hazards.  The requirements for these data are documented in the Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD) II (dated 9/12/01) for the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) available in the Latest News section at http://npoesslib.ipo.noaa.gov.  

NOAA is seeking information on the (1) readiness and performance, (2) licensing and distribution, (3) schedule and cost, (4) volume and area of interest for missions, and (5) statement of capabilities and other comments to provide commercial SAR satellite imagery as described below. 

1.  Please provide a description of your technical capabilities to provide commercial SAR satellite imagery.  At a minimum, address the following:

-	Sensor(s) and satellite(s) 
-	Frequency of coverage (repeatability)
-	High level formats (e.g. CEOS, GeoTIFF, other)
-	Low level data formats (e.g. Level 0 data)
-	Data content (sigma-naught, beta-naught, or other value, calibrated)
-	Data representation (8-bit vs 16-bit)
-	Applications look-up tables (e.g. ice LUT)
-	Data compression (MrSid, other)
-	Ordering processes and required lead times
-	Anticipated file sizes, delivery mechanisms and time lines. 

2.  NOAA is seeking limited data rights to broadcast and distribute SAR satellite imagery for environmental monitoring, education,  non-commercial, and other governmental purposes.  Data and data products or value-added products containing commercial SAR satellite imagery will not be distributed to other commercial entities.  Please describe your current copyright and license agreements.  Address distribution to academic institutions, scientific organizations, or contractors who are acting on behalf of the U.S. government for non-commercial applications.   Discuss the possibility for data sharing with other governments worldwide in areas of common operations, e.g., among foreign national ice centers.

3.  Please provide a schedule and rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) for the costs to the U.S. government to acquire commercial SAR satellite imagery.  Discuss pricing options based on volume, multi-year contracts and redistribution tiers.

As an option, NOAA would like to use its Fairbanks, Alaska Command and Data Acquisition Station to acquire and process SAR satellite imagery.  Discuss licensing and distribution costs for data captured at this facility.  For this option, please also provide information about the orbital parameters of your spacecraft and the uplink and downlink frequencies used for data transmission.

<CONTACT>Donald B. Ellison, Contracting Officer 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes an amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 published on 27 March 2002.  This amendment is intended to alert industry of changes in requirements, schedule, and acquisition strategy previously identified in N00164-02-R-0014   This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the governments plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about July of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental and production items.  In response to market research and user inputs, these may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) with some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optim ized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices have exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators.  These MDNS sub-systems have four-fold mission.  MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summariz ed below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems are listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired: Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (3) ACOG Reflex Sight (4) ACOG 4X Sight (5) Backup Iron Sight (6) Rail Interface System A(1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):   The CNVD integrates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather than a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SO PMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability  costs, improved reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high  humidity, reduced snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.   A(5)  Backup Iron Sight: implementation of day and night sighting capabilities with an emphasis on light emission control, improved capability to maintain the set position in a combat environment, integration of short and long range capability with improved durability over existing inserts, and reduced snag hazards.  A(6) Rail Interface System:  incorporation of design features which improve overall system performance (possibly floating barrel design concept), improved cleaning and maintenance, improved the durability, and production cost reduction. Group B, Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (3) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that  provides for combination of Infra-red and white light capability into one module. Existing contracts for the VLI will expire in FY 2002. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(2) ITPIAL: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, pattern and pulse capabilities, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the ITPIAL have expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(3) CVL:  Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance with green and black targets, improved compatibility with laser eye protection, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the CVL have expired.  The SOPMOD P rogram desires to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this capability into a unified system. (b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives:  Increased user acceptance to include (1) Improved Operation Suitability to include improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  The overall objective is increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions. (2)  Mini aturization, to include reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of firing. (3)  Increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, and ease of cleaning. (4)  Recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms.  Fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective. (5) Functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions. (6) Incorporation of improved safety features. (7) Low optical retro-reflection augmentation. (8) Improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions. (9) Improved lens protection, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers. (10) Improved eye relief whi ch provides optimum performance for SOF combat scenarios and host weapons. (11) Decreased life-cycle support costs. (12)  Improved power consumption, where applicable. (13) Incorporation of night vision capability where it currently does not exist. (14) Improved boresight retention. (15) Consolidation of current capabilities into multi-use systems.  This includes the integration of technologies currently fielded by multiple systems into single multi-use systems and utilization of modular technology, where such combinations are suitable for SOF combat. (16) Improved safety. 5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method. Items will be selected on a "Best Value" Contracting basis. IDIQ contracts will be awarded to offerors in accordance with the following plan: (A)  RCO Solicitation is to be published in July 200 2.  The RCO Solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Be advised that a DRAFT VERSION of the Performance Specification for the proposed procurement is available at the following web link:  http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/02R0014/02R0014.htm .  It is requested that this DRAFT Solicitation be reviewed by interested parties and provide any comments or questions to the Technical Point of Contract (Barry Gatewood) as identified in Paragraph 7 below by July 19, 2002. (B)  Solicitation is planned to close in August 2002.   Upon the closure date and time of the solicitation, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offerors Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  Functional samples to be u sed during the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations will be delivered prior to commencement of the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations.   (C)  Upon closure of the solicitation, a Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Team (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  An SSB Chairman will be assigned by the SSA to chair the SSB.  All members of the Source Selection Board shall be required to file a Certificate of Non-Disclosure prior to being given access to any of the source selection sensitive material.  A Test Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) will be appointed by the Source Selection Authority (SSA).  The TERP Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.  The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting s cores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.   Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains technical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.  The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Ve ndors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  (D)  Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors and clarify the offerors technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB will require demonstrations, to include functional demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Representatives from the user community will be asked to participate.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct an adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source  Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award(s).  In order to avoid unreasonable government test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found. (E)  Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.  Product samples are required to comply with key performance parameters (KPP) delineated in the solicitation.  Offerors who submit product samples that do not comply with the KPPs will not be further evaluated.  The samples must meet or exceed the stated thresholds.  These test results and comments will be submitted to the Technical Evaluation Review Panel (TERP). Developmental Testing (DT) will be conducted at NSWC Crane on the product samples to determine compliance with the KPPs, and environmental requirements, and safe to conduct further testing.  Operational Testing (OT) will be conducted by an Independent Validation/Verification Agent.  During OT the operators will determine if the samples meet or exceed the stated thresholds, meet combat suitability and combat effectiveness.  No offerors will be allowed to participate in the OT.  Representatives of the Contracting Officer from NSWC Crane will evaluate offeror(s) past performance and price proposals.  The price evaluation will be presented to the Contracting Officer.  The past performance evaluation will be presented to the TERP. The Contracting Officer/SSA shall use the recommendations and conclusions from the TERP, to include DT and OT analysis, contract management eval uation, past performance, and price evaluations, to derive negotiation strategies and an award determination which will be documented in business clearance memoranda in accordance with the Naval Acquisition Procedure Supplement and NSWC Crane quality assurance guidelines.  The goal is to utilize the same contract vehicles awarded prior to DT/OT for production hardware after this final down-select. 6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem drawings.  7.

DO NOT CONTACT TDA'S CONTRACT OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Ali Fassi Fihri, Chief Executive Officer, Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP), 6, bis, Rue Patrice Lumumba, Rabat, Morocco, Telephone:  (212-37) 65-06-95/65-06-96/75-36-47, Fax:  (212-37) 65-06-40, Email:  onepdg@mtds.com POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Morocco:  Bou Regreg Ozonation Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform a feasibility study for a proposed ozonation facility for the Bou Regreg River in Morocco.

The Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP) is responsible for producing potable water nationwide.  In addition, ONEP distributes water in small towns and rural areas.  In cities, water is generally distributed by water utilities under the purview of the Ministry of Interior.  Concessions have been granted for the water distribution of Casablanca, Rabat, and Tangiers to foreign companies.  The same utilities are responsible for wastewater management (collection and treatment) in cities.  In small towns, wastewater management is done by the Communes or by ONEP.  Wastewater collection systems in rural areas are virtually nonexistent. 

An important ONEP mission, given Morocco's constrained water resource situation, is to identify reasonable alternatives to traditional water treatment and supply approaches.  For instance, ONEP wants to acquire ozonation technologies, as well as new water oxidation and disinfecting techniques.  The agency has been predominantly using chlorine as a disinfectant, but the quality of raw water in many areas cannot be effectively treated with chlorine alone.  ONEP is also looking for appropriate technologies to remove nitrates from groundwater.  Specifically, ONEP would like to remove nitrates in the El Garaa aquifer, which is located in the Ben Slimane area (between Rabat and Casablanca), also in close proximity to the proposed Bou Regreg facility.  

Bou Regreg water is generally of good quality, but it contains sediments with high concentrations of iron and manganese, which make it harder to treat and affect the water's taste and smell qualities.  An increase in the region's population has made it necessary for the expansion of the existing water treatment plant, which would replace chlorination by ozonation of raw water followed by filtration on activated coal grains.  The purpose of this feasibility study is to assess whether the chlorination system used to treat water from the Bou Regreg River should be upgraded with ozonation technology followed by activated carbon filtration.  The feasibility study will complement previous studies conducted by the Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP) and will constitute an opportunity to introduce American technologies in Morocco.  The tasks for the study are summarized as follows:  Task 1.1) critical analysis of the results of an earlier study conducted by ONEP on the Bou Regreg ozonation facility; Task 1.2) options analysis for the implementation of a water treatment ozonation facility; Task 1.3) technical/economic analysis of options and environmental impact assessment; Task 2.1) preparation of project design specifications; Task 2.2) preparation of an implementation plan; Task 2.3) preparation of a finance strategy; and Task 2.4) final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA). 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and in French directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. Friday, September 6, 2002 at 4:00 p.m. local Moroccan time at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Do NOT contact Glen Williams concerning this notice.  Direct all inquiries and provide all information to: Robert Porro (216) 433-5921, arporro@grc.nasa.gov.    NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for the development of airbreathing inlet systems for third generation access to space vehicles in conjunction with the Revolutionary Turbine Accelerator (RTA) project.  Currently, multiple vehicle concepts are being considered as the third generation access to space vision vehicle. One concept considers a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicle that uses a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) airbreathing propulsion system, while alternate vehicle concepts are considering a two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) vehicle whose first stage may use a gas turbine propulsion system.  The Glenn Research Center Inlet Branch is developing the inlet systems for the gas turbine flow path on each of these vehicle concepts.  At this time, the Inlet Branch is actively designing an inlet system for the proposed X-43B research flight vehicle, and the Inlet Branch anticipates supporting the TSTO gas turbine flow path inlet design in the near future.  To this end, the NASA Glenn Research Center is seeking technical assistance for the design and analysis of these inlets.  Anticipated tasks for this effort will include, but are not limited to:    (1)	Inlet sizing/gas turbine engine mass flow matching studies.   (2)	Preliminary and detailed aerodynamic design of gas turbine inlet systems for Mach 0 to 4 operation with appropriate flow control to maximize inlet performance and operability over the operational Mach number range.   (3) Development of inlet design techniques to mitigate inlet performance loss due to vehicle forebody boundary layer ingestion.   (4)	Preliminary definition and design of inlet mechanical variable geometry actuation mechanisms with an emphasis on vehicle/propulsion system inlet integration.   (5)	Extensive use of Two-Dimensional (2D) and Three-Dimensional (3D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as a design and analysis tool to guide the inlet design process and refine candidate inlet designs.  (6)	Use of sophisticated 3D CFD tools to conduct end-to-end analysis of vehicle/integrated inlet systems.  (7) Development and application of sophisticated CFD tools to conduct time accurate analysis of TBCC propulsion system mode transition.  (8)	 Research support for wind tunnel testing of inlet systems.  Assist Glenn Research Center engineers in defining testing research objectives and assist in the actual testing process.  The proposed tasks of this research effort will be worked concurrently by Glenn Research Center Inlet Branch staff and the chosen contractor(s).  It is expected that the contractor(s) will have frequent communication with Glenn Research Center Inlet Branch staff in order to facilitate technology exchange between the two parties in the form of daily, weekly, or bi-weekly Glenn Research Center on-site meetings, as appropriate  Any company that wishes to participate in this effort must address how they plan to meet this requirement.  Also, the principal investigators identified to support this effort must have the technical background and expertise to perform the various tasks.  The principal investigators must have demonstrated extensive experience in supersonic inlet design and analysis for high Mach number gas turbine propulsion systems.  In addition, the principal investigators for the CFD portion of the effort must have extensive specific CFD experience in the area of supersonic inlet analysis and propulsion/airframe integration.  As a minimum, each company must submit relevant curricula vitae for each of the principal investigators identified to support this effort. The effort is expected is for a duration of four years and multiple awards are anticipated.   NO solicitation exists; therefore, do NOT request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published a notice of proposed rulemaking for a Medicare-Endorsed Prescription Drug Card Assistance Initiative.  We proposed a price comparison web-site to assist in a beneficiary?s decision about what prescription drug discount card would best serve their needs.  The purpose of this contract is to develop and write the specifications for such a web-site.  In order to ensure that beneficiaries receive information on programs to assist them in making informed decisions about whether and which card program to join, the proposed initiative required that comparative information on the prices offered to Medicare beneficiaries for drugs covered by each discount card be available, and that this would be done through a web-site that makes the discount information generally available.  The end objective would be to make available the actual price a beneficiary would encounter at the point of sale.  Recognizing the technical difficulty of this, CMS proposed that, in the first year, discounts on the website be expressed as a percentage off the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for a standard set of the most commonly used drugs and dosages.  However, by the second year of the initiative, the proposed rule required the site to publish the actual price that Medicare beneficiaries would pay for drugs offered by each Medicare-endorsed discount card sponsor.  Participating card sponsors would be required to provide all the necessary information regarding their discount cards.  While the stated purpose of this procurement is technical, achieving the purpose of the procurement would also require providing comparative information for the actual prices offered at the retail level, which we believe is not the usual way of doing business.   Among the possible technical challenges of developing the drug selection and pricing display methodology underlying the comparison system are:  1) identifying selection criteria for determining which drugs to display (e.g., how to define commonly used drugs and establish cutoffs); 2) determining appropriate and meaningful presentations to enable beneficiaries to identify the drugs they take; 3) developing methodologies to standardize the drug identification (e.g., name brand versus generic), dosage, unit of payment (e.g., per monthly supply), and price information (alternatives to actual drug price include an average price, or maximum prices, savings and discounts.);  4)  accommodating pricing /discount/rebate variations in contracts between a card sponsor and drug manufacturers, retail pharmacies and mail order programs; and 5) assuring the system can be updated as needed to accommodate the proposed requirement that drug prices be posted for 48 hours prior to becoming active.  Further, it should be considered whether beneficiaries and other target audiences of the web-site understand the methods selected to present information and whether they would find the information sufficiently useful and complete (e.g. decision to display only commonly used drugs).  In such cases, it would need to be determined what feasible marketing and education strategies could be pursued to prevent beneficiary confusion, address beneficiary expectations, and assist the beneficiary (or the beneficiary?s advocate) in understanding any limitations to the drug information presented and how to seek clarifying information as needed.  Finally, the cost and burden to parties involved in producing data, and to building and maintaining the system must be considered.  Given the strong interest by both Medicare beneficiaries and the industry, the project must be carried out in a transparent manner and there must be access for both groups to the process.  The Government will be responsible for determining the most appropriate and feasible approach to the development of this web-site based on the best available information.  It is clear that not all parties can be satisfied, but at least it should be possible to make an optimum decision.  Thus, the project will involve an early report that presents the options with pros and cons to each.  Please be aware that the Contractor will not have the right to use, release to others, reproduce, distribute, or publish any data first produced or specifically used by the Contractor in the performance of this contract, except to the extent specifically allowed, in writing, by the Contracting Officer.  The period of performance for this project is projected to be only four [4] months and the level of effort is substantial.  Thus, interested parties should be aware that particular attention will be paid to the depth of resources presented and the plans to manage such a short/intense project. The Government will be seeking a written proposal and may invite those offerors considered technically acceptable to make oral presentations.  The successful offeror must have demonstrated knowledge of Medicare beneficiary information dissemination and in developing web-sites that supply detailed comparison information to the general public, particularly price comparison information.  Also, they must have demonstrated experience in dealing with projects in which there a variety of competing interests, particularly organizations that represent interest groups.  If your organization can meet these requirements, please submit sufficient documentation, or original and five copies for our review.  In addition, please provide Company Name, Company Address, Company Point of Contact (phone number and e-mail), business size status, and identify if your company is under a GSA Schedule and the schedule and contract number.  Any questions with regards to this Sources Sought Notice should be directed to Derrick Head at (401) 786-62545 or e-mail at dheard@cms.hhs.gov.  All responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall be received at the following address No Later Than Monday, July 22, 2002:  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Attn:  Derrick Heard, Mailstop C2-21-15, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850.  In the interest of time, we are running this notice virtually concurrent with the solicitation.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to separate cesium and technetium from Hanford Site tank wastes.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate cesium and technetium separation conditions.  The requirement is to determine and verify the process conditions to optimize cesium and technetium separation from simulated Hanford tank wastes.  Cesium and technetium can be jointly or independently separated from the alkaline, Hanford Site tank wastes. 

The laboratory tests will use radioactive waste samples and material that simulates Hanford tank waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various radioactive tank wastes found at the Hanford Site.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain RCRA metals such as barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, silver, and zinc to the extent that these metals are soluble in the alkaline waste solutions.  Technetium is primarily present as the pertechnetate anion in the Hanford Site tank wastes whereas cesium is present as a cation.  

The anticipated scope of work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale cesium and technetium separation tests to demonstrate the steps of the proposed flow sheet.  These tests are to be conducted without acidifying the alkaline tank waste simulant and radioactive samples.  The effect of pH and specific constituents of radioactive tank wastes, such as aluminum, carbonate, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, potassium, sodium, uranium, and halides on the performance of the cesium and technetium separation processes are to be determined.  The separation processes must achieve a minimum cesium decontamination factor of 400 and a minimum technetium decontamination factor of 4.  Decontamination factor is defined as:

Decontamination Factor = Initial Concentration / Final Concentration 

Separation of cesium and technetium from the Hanford Site tank wastes can be accomplished using ion exchange, fractional crystallization, electro-chemical separations, or other technique as envisioned by the vendor.  The vendor is to specify the proposed process flowsheet for separating cesium and technetium from the Hanford Site tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The vendor must provide a material balance for the proposed cesium and technetium separation processes that is based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquid, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet for cesium and technetium separation. 
The technical approach described above is CHG?s current concept of how this program should proceed.  However, we welcome alternative approaches and we solicit your ideas to accelerate and/or improve the process of implementing Cesium and Technetium Separation Technology.


In order to be considered for any resulting Request For Proposal, firms must meet the following qualifications:

?	Your firm must be committed to working safely and must demonstrate this commitment by having an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of 1.0, or less, for the past three years and show an improving trend in safety performance.  Please provide this information with your response.

?	Your firm must have previous experience in cesium and technetium separations or related work within the past three years.  Please provide a brief synopsis of your experience and references with your response.

?	Your firm should have had revenues in excess of $1 million/year for the past three years derived from cesium and technetium separations, or related work.  Please provide this information with your response.

?	As a government contractor in a nuclear facility, CHG is subject to enforcement actions under 10 CFR 820, General Statement of Enforcement Policy, (Price Anderson Amendment Act).  The enforcement actions require compliance with 10 CFR 820, Procedural Rules for DOE Nuclear Activities; 10 CFR 830, Nuclear Safety Management; 10 CFR 835, Occupational Radiation Protection; and 10 CFR 708, Contractor Employee Protection.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to separate solids from Hanford Site tank wastes. The solid-liquid separation processes must be capable of producing a solids-free liquid solution.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate solid-liquid separation conditions.  The requirement is to determine and verify the process conditions to optimize solid-liquid separation from simulated and radioactive Hanford tank wastes.  

Laboratory tests will be conducted with a type of tanks waste known as saltcake.  Saltcake waste consists primarily of crystallized sodium, potassium, and aluminum salts compounds containing carbonate, chloride, fluoride, hydroxide, nitrate, nitrite, oxalate, phosphate, and sulfate.  Saltcake waste also includes soluble radionuclides (e.g. Cs-137, Tc-99), insoluble radionuclides (e.g. Sr-90, transuranic elements) and other soluble and insoluble cations.  The saltcake waste will be dissolved by addition of water.  The solids present in the dissolved saltcake waste range in particle size from 0.1 to 100 microns. The laboratory tests will use radioactive waste samples and material that simulates the dissolved saltcake waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various radioactive tank wastes found at the Hanford Site.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain RCRA regulated metals such as barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, silver, and zinc.  

The vendor is to specify the proposed process flowsheet for separating solids from the liquid phase of the Hanford Site tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The vendor proposed flowsheet must identify all modes of operation of the solid-liquid separation equipment, including maintenance and cleaning of the equipment with chemical reagents.  

The anticipated scope of work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale solid-liquid separation tests to demonstrate the steps of the proposed process.  These tests are to be conducted without acidifying the alkaline tank waste simulant and radioactive samples.  The effects of equipment operating parameters such as slurry velocity or pressure across the solid-liquid separation media are to be determined for the simulants and radioactive waste samples.  

The vendor must provide a material balance for the proposed solid-liquid separation process that is based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquid, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to separate sulfate from Hanford tank wastes.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate sulfate separation conditions.  The requirement is to determine and verify, in a simulated sulfate removal system, the process conditions to optimize sulfate removal from simulated Hanford tank wastes.  

The laboratory tests will use material that simulates Hanford tank waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various radioactive tank wastes found at Hanford.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain RCRA metals such as barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, silver, and zinc to the extent that these metals are soluble in the alkaline solutions.

The anticipated scope of work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale sulfate removal tests per the steps of the proposed process flow sheet (see Figure 1). 

 The sulfate removal tests are to be conducted under acidic conditions by adding nitric acid to the alkaline tank waste simulant and radioactive samples.  The amount of nitric acid added to the alkaline tank waste should be minimized.  The constituents in the off gas stream from the sulfate removal process will be identified and quantified.  The effect of pH and specific constituents of radioactive tank wastes, such as aluminum, sodium, potassium, phosphate, carbonate, and halides on sulfate removal are to be determined.  The partitioning of strontium, cesium, technetium, and actinides into the sulfate product and the sulfate depleted liquid waste phase is to be determined.  The vendor is to test other, non-RCRA metals (e.g. calcium) for effectiveness as the reagent for separating sulfate from the tank waste simulants.  The sulfate product is to be subjected to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) per 40 CFR Part 261 to determine the concentration of metals compared to the Universal Treatment Standards (UTS) specified in 40 CFR Part 268.48.

Based on the results of the TCLP test results, further solidification of the sulfate product may be necessary to meet UTS limits for metals.  The vendor is to recommend and conduct testing of the low-level waste solidification process, if warranted based on the results of the TCLP test results.  The vendor is to conduct testing or demonstrate through analyses the sulfate product (or solidified low-level waste form) meets the criteria for low-level waste forms as defined in the U. S. Nuclear regulatory Commission Technical Position on Waste Form, revision 1 dated January 1991. 

The vendor is to provide a proposed flowsheet and material balance for removing sulfate from the Hanford Site tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The material balance for the proposed sulfate removal process must be based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquid, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to bulk vitrify Hanford tank waste.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate bulk vitrification conditions.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in connection with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability in GFY03 to run radioactive laboratory tests or the ability to team with a laboratory that has the capability to run radioactive laboratory tests that simulate containerized grout conditions.  The requirement is to determine the effect of specific constituents, such as sodium, cesium, technetium, nitrates, sulfates, and halides, on the properties of grout in a simulated containerized grout system.  The laboratory tests will use material that simulates Hanford tank waste mixed with grout forming materials.  The tank waste will be representative of the waste contained in certain Hanford tanks or another formulation, to be specified by CHG, that represents saltcake waste.

The engineering evaluation will consist of determining process equipment necessary to blend, cure, and dispose of grouted tank waste in containers.  The vendor must identify the blending technology to be used and the container design.  The performance of these design parameters on grout curing times must be explained.

The vendor is to specify the proposed process flowsheet for grouting the tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The vendor must provide a material balance for the proposed tank waste treatment process that is based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquids, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendors proposed flowsheet.

The laboratory tests will use radioactive waste samples and materials that simulate Hanford tank waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various tank wastes found at the Hanford Site.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulated metals including but not limited to antimony, barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, nickel, silver, and zinc to the extent that these metals are present in the actual tank wastes and other metals, anions and organic compounds such as aluminum, bismuth, iron, lanthanum, manganese, sodium, chloride, fluoride, hydroxide, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, sulfate, oxalate.  The tank wastes are not known to contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations above 50 ppm.

The laboratory-scale work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale waste treatment tests per the steps of the vendor proposed process flowsheet.  Figure 1 provides a preliminary flowsheet concept for grouting the waste, however the vendor is responsible for developing the final flowsheet.  The steps to be demonstrated are blending, curing, container handling, as well as any other process steps identified in the vendors proposed flowsheet.  The constituents in the off gas stream from the waste treatment and immobilization process will be identified and quantified.  Formulations for the solidified tank waste are to be developed and tested to demonstrate compliance with the applicable EPA and DOE disposal requirements.

<SUBJECT>11 -- TRU Tank Waste Solidification for Disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-CHG06
<RESPDATE>072302
<ARCHDATE>08072002
<CONTACT>Reese  Bang, Contract Administrator, Phone 509-372-0528, Fax 509-376-0825, Email Reese_Bang_rl.gov
<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to solidify transuranic (TRU) waste presently stored as sludges (metal precipitates) in several of the Hanford Site underground waste storage tanks.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate TRU tank waste solidification conditions.  The requirement is to determine, verify, and optimize the process conditions for TRU tank waste solidification using simulated and radioactive Hanford tank wastes.  

The engineering evaluation will consist of determining process equipment necessary to separate soluble salts (e.g., sodium fluoride, sodium nitrate, cesium nitrate, and sodium pertechnetate) and solidify the TRU tank wastes to meet waste acceptance criteria for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).  Waste acceptance criteria for the WIPP is available at http://www.wipp.carlsbad.nm.us/library/caolib.htm listed under DOE/WIPP-02-3122 for contact-handled and NRC Docket 71-9212, revision 1 for remote-handled TRU waste.  The engineering evaluation will also determine whether the solidified TRU waste should classified as contact-handled (radiation dose rate less than or equal to 200-mrem/hr at waste package surface) or remote-handled (radiation dose rate greater than 200-mrem/hr at waste package surface).  

The vendor is to specify the proposed flowsheet for treating the TRU tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The vendor must provide a material balance for the proposed TRU tank waste treatment process that is based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquids, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet.

The laboratory tests will use radioactive waste samples and materials that simulate Hanford tank waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various TRU tank wastes found at the Hanford Site.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulated metals including but not limited to antimony, barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, nickel, silver, and zinc to the extent that these metals are present in the actual tank wastes and other metals, anions and organic compounds such as aluminum, bismuth, iron, lanthanum, manganese, sodium, chloride, fluoride, hydroxide, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, sulfate, oxalate.  The TRU tank wastes are not known to contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations above 50 ppm.

The laboratory-scale work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale TRU waste treatment tests per the steps of the vendor proposed flowsheet.  Figure 1 provides a preliminary flowsheet concept for treatment of the TRU waste, however the vendor is responsible for developing the final flowsheet.  The steps to be demonstrated are solid-liquid separation and TRU immobilization, as well as any other process steps identified in the vendor?s proposed flowsheet.  The TRU waste treatment tests are to be conducted without acidifying the TRU tank waste simulant or radioactive samples.  The constituents in the off gas stream from the TRU waste treatment and immobilization process will be identified and quantified.  The removal of soluble salts from the TRU tank waste sludges is to be demonstrated.  The concentrations in each phase of the major components are to be quantified during the washing of the TRU tank waste samples and simulants.  The solids removal efficiency and partitioning of radionuclides (strontium-90, cesium-137, technetium-99, plutonium-239/240, and americium-241) versus operating parameters for the solid-liquid separation process are to be determined.  Formulations for the immobilized TRU tank waste are to be developed and tested to demonstrate compliance with the applicable WIPP waste acceptance criteria.
