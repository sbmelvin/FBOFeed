<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is soliciting offers for a contract to conduct studies of the potential for environmental and therapeutic agents to induce immunotoxicity in laboratory animals.  The contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities as needed to examine the immune system in laboratory animals following exposure to xenobiotics.  The contractor shall evaluate the Potential to Induce Immunotoxicity through studies on Immunomodulation, Hypersensitivity and Autoimmunity.  The contractor shall evaluate xenobiotics for their ability to modulate immune function following adult or perinatal exposures. The contractor shall perform Immunopathology studies and measure standard toxicity parameters including body weight, selected organ weights and hematological profile.  Extended histopathology of the lymphoid tissues should be performed for all test articles.  The contractor shall assess Humoral and Cell Mediated Immunity, quantitate splenic cellularity, splenic differentials, and B cell, T cell, T cell subsets, NK cells and monocyte enumeration by cytometric analysis, and evaluate Non-specific Immunity The contractor shall assess the ability of identified immunomodulators to alter disease resistance following challenge with at least two established host resistance models. The contractor shall examine the allergenic and immunogenic potential of test articles of interest in BALB-C mice and matching controls using the mouse ear swelling test and the LLNA. The contractor should have the ability to utilize rodent models for autoimmune disease (e.g. NZB mice for human SLE, NOD mouse for insulin-dependent diabetes or Brown-Norway rat for mercury-induced glomerulonephritis) and monitor for the development or exacerbation of autoimmune disease using appropriate pathological and biochemical tests. Immunology is a developing science and, as such, it is expected that new and improved methodology will be required to maintain "state of the art" evaluation.  In addition, the validation of methods to determine the potential for xenobiotics to induce or potentiate autoimmune disease should be given a high priority. Alternatively, follow-up studies to help establish cellular and/or molecular mechanisms of action for immune perturbations observed during immune function testing may be appropriate.  Novel screening strategies including the use of molecular techniques would be desirable.  The Offeror shall have a working testing laboratory and animal facility in place that has the analytical equipment, clinical laboratory equipment, necropsy, and histology facilities necessary to conduct GLP immunotoxicology studies of environmental agents, and staff with appropriate expertise to expose, care for, and process large numbers of animals.  Award of one three (3) year, with five (5) additional one year options, performance based, cost-reimbursement, term form, level of effort contract on July 1, 2005 is planned.  The estimated level of effort is 42,432 direct labor hours for the three year base period and 70,720 direct labor hours for the five additional option years.  The contract will contain two additional options; one for evaluation of additional xenobiotics and a second for evaluation of new and improved technology.  These two options, which may be executed once in each of years 2 through 8 of the contract, will offer an additional 19,992 direct labor hours for the evaluation of xenobiotics (2856 hours each time it is exercised) and an additional 4,284 direct labor hours for the evaluation of new technology (612 hours each time it is exercised).  The anticipated release date for the RFP is October 8, 2004 with proposals due on approximately November 8, 2004.  Interested organizations should request a copy of the solicitation by submitting a written request to the point of contact.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  The electronic version of the FedBizOpps synopsis will be available on the internet at: http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rcb/rfp.htm.  An electronic copy of the RFP will be posted to this site on or about the RFP release date.  This requirement is unrestricted.  NAICS Code is 541710.

THIS IS A DRAFT PROGRAM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ANNOUNCEMENT (PRDA) ONLY.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this DRAFT PRDA is to obtain market research on the details for the final announcement.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.  Information will be released in sections.  Therefore, entities who wish to participate in this market research should maintain an awareness of this website.

The Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program continues to be a vital Department of Defense / National Aeronautics and Space Administration (DoD/NASA) and industry effort.  IHPRPT was established to strengthen the technology base of the DoD and commercial rocket propulsion systems through the development of advanced, innovative rocket propulsion technology.

The Government is considering a new Upper Stage Engine Technology (USET) effort.  The objective of this effort is to pursue the IHPRPT upper stage engine goals through improved concurrent engineering and management tools.  This will be achieved in a three part approach consisting of tool improvement/development, implementation, and validation.  The implementation and validation will be accomplished through the design, fabrication, and test of either a hydrogen turbopump or a combustion chamber, or both.

Legitimate entities capable of receiving ITAR restricted information and interested in participating in this market research should attend an Industry Day to be held at AFRL/PRS, Edwards AFB, CA on Thursday 29 May 03.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@ustda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Dr. Sherif Ismail, President & Chairman, Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company, 3 El Mokhayam El Dayem Street, Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt, Phone:(20-2) 263-4000, Fax: (20-2) 263-1010  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Plant in Egypt.

The Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company (ECHEM), a past and current grantee of U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funding assistance, is looking to increase its current production of PVC to meet domestic and export needs by modernizing operations and developing a new production line.  ECHEM is looking for a U.S. consultant to conduct a feasibility study that will develop a technical and economic assessment of its future expansion as well as provide a final report that could be presented to financiers.  

Expanded PVC production would diversify Egypt’s petrochemicals industry based largely on domestic natural gas.  This industry’s growth is a priority for the national government because of its ability to meet domestic needs, generate foreign currency income, expand technological capacity and gain skilled employment opportunities.  Continued USTDA engagement in the Egyptian petrochemicals sector supports U.S. economic policy priorities for the region, specifically concerning the Middle East Free Trade Area initiative and objectives to promote private sector investment in Egypt.  

The total project cost is estimated to be $260 million and would assist Egypt’s physical infrastructure development by increasing the country’s manufacturing capacity at established industrial zones.  
 
	The terms of reference for the PVC plant feasibility study are summarized as follows:
	
·	Prepare Market Assessment
·	Process Technology/Licensor Selection
·	Conduct Site Investigation and Preliminary Environmental Assessment
·	Prepare Cost Estimates
·	Financial and Benefit Analyses
·	Risk Assessment and Mitigation Analysis
·	Prepare Project Implementation and Financing Strategy
·	Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$271,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.  An additional US$271,129 will be provided by the Grantee as their Cost Share.  The total budget of the feasibility study is US$542,129.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00PM on October 21, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Ion Poiana, General Manager, National Meteorological Administration, 97 Sos. Bucharest- Ploiesti, Sector 1, 013686 Bucharest, Romania; Phone: +40-21-231-2139; Fax: +40-21-230-3143.  
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on the Integrated Climatology, Agro-Meteorological, Air Pollution Forecast and Warning, Computation and Training Center (INTEROPERATE) project for the Romanian National Meteorological Administration  (RNMA).

Since 2000, the RNMA has focused on implementing a new strategy to create a modern meteorological surveillance system.  The first RNMA investment project, SIMIN, which is valued at $55 million, addressed Romania’s primary objective of modernizing and integrating the country’s various resources and real-time detection capabilities, and also facilitated the exchange of data at the local, regional, and global levels. Under the project, the team led by the RNMA and Lockheed Martin deployed weather radars, automated weather observation stations, lightning detection networks, weather satellite reception, numerical weather prediction models, hydrological buoys, forecaster decision/display systems, and telecommunications networks in Romania. The project team successfully integrated state-of-the-art, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies and products building on Romania’s existing meteorological infrastructure.  

The DESWAT program was initiated following SIMIN in order to improve the flood forecasting capabilities of the RNMA. The implementation of DESWAT, at a cost of $64 million, represented a significant upgrading of Romania’s hydrological monitoring system, enabling real-time monitoring and rapid response. The lead contractor on this project was Lockheed Martin.

Building upon the SIMIN and DESWAT projects, the Romanian Government is now deploying a water management (WATMAN) system, which will integrate all the information related to river basin monitoring and will include all relevant ‘actors’ – water agencies, industrial, urban, and agricultural users, hydro-works, etc. – into a modern instrument for water management and disaster response. The system will be an essential tool in predicting and managing water emergencies such as floods, droughts, dam accidents, and accidental pollution.

The proposed INTEROPERATE project would upgrade and enhance the existing SIMIN infrastructure, and would also add computing power, data storage capacities, and communications infrastructure in order to collect, integrate, and analyze data generated from the SIMIN, DESWAT, and WATMAN projects, increasing the effectiveness and benefits of all three.  Ultimately, the INTEROPERATE project will form a core element of Romania’s planned National Crisis Management System. The INTEROPERATE project would specifically meet the following objectives:
·	Modernization and enhancement of the observation and processing subsystems for climatology;
·	Modernization of the agro-meteorological monitoring and forecast processes, and integrating them into a national system;
·	Modernization of atmospheric pollution monitoring and forecast processes and integrating them into a national system;
·	Development of a national meteorological data processing and storage center, encompassing data from SIMIN, DESWAT, and WATMAN;
·	Development of an ongoing training program for meteorologists, agro-meteorologists, and environmental experts, with appropriate facilities.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $340,100 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m., October 25, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Government intends for the 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $100 Million.  The NTE amount for each contract will be $120 Million divided by the number of contract awardees. Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.    
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.

     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
     The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.     
     THE SOLICITATION WILL BE OFFERED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, incorporating all previous modifications, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).   No other changes have been made.

Technical POC:  Mr. John V. McNamara, 315-330-4175, e-mail:  John.McNamara@rl.af.mil.  Program Manager, Mr. Jerry F. Lipa , 315-330-4494, email:  Jerry.Lipa@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: Lori Smith, Contracting Officer, Email Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil, Phone (315) 330-1955, Fax (315) 330-8029.

The Information Directorate, Systems Concepts and Applications Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) applications.  Of particular interest are technologies that can significantly reduce the time between information technology availability and its employment into the research and development programs that support legacy and new military electronic systems.  Also of interest are commercial technologies that can improve the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and useability of these new and legacy military electronic systems.  Access to Rome Research Site laboratories, including such legacy systems as Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Master Caution Panel (MCP), Joint Defensive Planner (JDP), and others, will be provided as necessary.  This effort will investigate the application and/or development of emerging and in-use commercial information technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Legacy and evolving Air Force C4I systems:  This area covers not only technological upgrades to the existing Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) command and control structure/functions, but also revolutionary concepts for future operations centers, such as the Advanced Technology Air and Space Operations Center (AT-AOC).  Examples of the applicable technologies are advanced distributed architectures, publish/subscribe concepts and architectures, distributed computing environments, real-time processing, digital graphics, portable/wearable/mobile computational devices, and advanced displays/user interfaces.  (2) Simulation and modeling technologies applicable to Air Force C4I systems:  Simulation and modeling for this purpose represent the full range of applications from supporting the development of the individual components within an Air Force C4I system to developing course of action evaluation tools to facilitate the AOC planning function. Examples of these technologies include: model abstraction, multi-resolution modeling, model interoperability, real-time simulation systems, advanced simulation architectures, C4I concept evaluations, long haul networked simulations utilizing HLA and other standard protocols, and application of these, or other, technologies to the concepts of rehearsal, dynamic planning/execution, and dynamic battle management. (3) Technology for integration, test and demonstration of Air Force C4I systems: Systems integration and demonstration are used here to represent the spectrum of testing, evaluation, and demonstration that is typically conducted during the development, integration, and fielding phases of an Air Force C4I system and any of its component parts.     Examples of these technologies are those that are involved with the integration, measurement, assessment, and demonstration of information, Command and Control, communications, and enterprise systems as they relate to, or are part of, legacy and developing Air Force C4I systems.     (4) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems:  This area encompasses all information technology that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I systems/applications.  Examples of these technologies are data retrieval/mining, data storage, software/system monitors, data visualization, data busses, publish/subscribe mechanisms, digital moving maps, and decision making techniques.  (5) Development of technology to enhance and enable the use of collaborative environments in AF C4ISR systems and enterprises:  This refers to development of individual collaboration tools, as well as the larger collaborative environment which results from networking the individual tools for simultaneous employment with multiple users that are widely dispersed.  Examples of these technologies are collaborative engineering and virtual prototyping environments which enable the collaborative development and application of information, air planning, and enterprise technologies/applications 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a 2-3 page white paper with a cover letter.  The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Jerry F. Lipa, Reference BAA-03-02-IFKA, Rome Research Site/IFKA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.     The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.     Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission. An informational briefing is not planned.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) The overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal, (2) the innovativeness of the proposed approach and technologies, (3) the applicability of the proposed technologies to proposed and legacy military electronic systems, and (4) the reasonableness and realism of the proposed costs and fees.     The offeror’s capability and capacity to achieve the objectives of this BAA will also be evaluated.     The technical criteria (1-3 above) will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and are of interest to the Government.     White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.     Individual white paper and proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start approximately the second quarter of FY-03.  Individual awards will normally not exceed 24 months in duration, with dollar amounts ranging from $100K to $500K.  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $25M.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  The e-mail must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.     A copy of the Rome "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.

This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 05.  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award.  White papers for FY-03 should be submitted by 15 Jan 03, for FY-04 by 1 Oct 03, for FY-05 by 1 Aug 04, and for FY-06 by 1 Aug 05.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective Fiscal Year after the dates cited.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper which shall be considered.  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign allied participation is authorized at the prime contractor level.  Foreign allied participation is allowed of the following countries:  France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and United Kingdom.  Proposers are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD intends to procure airframe Depot level maintenance for the Navy and Marine C-9B/DC-9 aircraft.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to request statements of interest to support the procurement of Depot level maintenance for C-9B/DC-9 aircraft.  Engine Depot is not anticipated to be included in this procurement. The DC9s are slated for retirement and will require only limited maintenance, such as drop-ins and field teams. The Government has a requirement to procure a base year plus 4 options. The Navy and Marines currently operate 17 C-9Bs and 4 DC9s worldwide. These aircraft are an “off-the-shelf’ version of the commercial DC-9 aircraft and differ slightly from the rest of commercial DC-9 fleet due to Navy unique modifications. Parts, material, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) maintenance documentation, manuals, and necessary OEM engineering source data are commercially available. However, there may be the necessity to maintain a licensing agreement with the OEM. The prime contractor and subcontractors must be Aircraft Repair Station licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 145 to participate in this effort. The primary performance objective is to provide the aircraft depot maintenance services necessary to meet the C-9B/DC-9 aircraft operational requirements. This also includes field team maintenance that occurs away from the Contractor’s designated depot facility, via Contractor Field Teams or Contractor selected Subcontractors and Vendors. The contract type will be a requirements type contract with no minimum or maximum ordering requirements due to the uncertain number and timing of aircraft retirements. The contract may or may not include modification work for planned upgrades.  A draft solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR website in the upcoming months; therefore, if you would like to be notified when the draft solicitation is posted please notify Anthony DeVico via e-mail at anthony.devico@navy.mil.  REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION/ STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES:  Interested parties are requested to submit a brief statement of interest/capabilities. The Government also desires to know if industry has a preference for type of contract: either a FAR Part 15 standard GOV type or FAR Part 12 Commercial type contract. Respondents are asked to indicate their rationale for any stated preference to assist the Government with making this decision. Responses are due no later than 07 October 2004 and should be forwarded to Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, RADM William A. Moffett Building, Attn:  Anthony DeVico, CODE:  2.4.3.1, 47123 Buse Road, Bldg, 2272, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1607 or anthony.devico@navy.mil no later than 4:00PM Eastern Standard Time on 12 October 2004.  Electronic responses are preferred.  Submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government.  Submissions will not be returned.  THIS RFI IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  Any questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Mr. Anthony DeVico at 301-757-5911 (voice)/301-757-5946 (fax)/AIR-2.4.3.1/anthony.devico@navy.mil.***

<SUBJECT>D -- National Repository for Detention Space Availability
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit (1) comments and questions relating to the development of the Statement of Work for the National Repository for Detention Space Availability (hereinafter ''Repository'') that incorporate current technologies and best practices from the competitive marketplace, and (2) industry interest in the Repository project. 

BACKGROUND: The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) was established and activated in September 2001 by directive of Congress (Pub. L. 106-553, 166, 114 Stat. 2762 (2000)) in response to growing concerns regarding Federal detention.  The Federal Detention Trustee leads the development of Department of Justice (DOJ) detention policy and manages Federal detention resources to maximize available detention space and contain costs associated with the detention of criminal defendants and aliens awaiting adjudication and/or removal from the United States.  Additionally, the Federal Detention Trustee ensures that the DOJ provides safe, secure, and humane detention services and works with the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to identify emerging detention-related problems and project future detention space needs.  Additional information describing the mission and activities of the Federal Detention Trustee is available on the Trustee's Internet web site. 

As part of the fiscal year 2003 budget, it is anticipated that the OFDT will receive an appropriation for the development of the Repository.  The primary goal of the Repository is to allow state, local, and private detention space providers to post detention space availability, daily rates, and services available for federal use.  The Repository will be used by federal law enforcement officers to identify (and place detainees into) operationally and fiscally efficient detention facilities.  It will assist the Federal Detention Trustee with ensuring that necessary state, local, and private detention space is identified and utilized in a cost-effective manner.  Additionally, the Repository will facilitate the processing and payment of invoices for detention services provided to the USMS and INS.  The Repository will support DOJ strategic objectives and annual performance goals by (1) improving procedures for acquiring necessary detention space;  (2) improving the management of detention-related resources to contain costs; and (3) using detention resources in a more cost-effective and efficient manner.

To meet the identified goals and to ensure nationwide accessibility, the Repository will be developed as an Internet-based application.  It will be designed to handle at least 5,000 user sessions daily.  Additionally, the Repository will be designed to be accessible via mobile personal digital assistants (PDAs).

PROJECT SCHEDULE:  Development and implementation of the Repository will be conducted in three phases: (1) planning and requirements analysis;  (2) system development and integration; and (3) operations and maintenance.  Phase 1 will include fully defining the scope of the Repository, developing a comprehensive concept of operations; preparing the necessary Department of Justice-required documentation to justify continued development, or termination, of the Repository; and identifying and resolving risks associated with implementation of the Repository.  Phase 2 will consist of system development, integration, and implementation to include software development, interfacing with legacy systems, as appropriate, pilot testing, preparation of documentation and necessary training manuals, start-up, and data migration from legacy systems.  (Phases 1 and 2 may be conducted concurrently.)  Phase 3 will consist of (a) operation of the Repository and providing support for external users and (b) application support, maintenance, and improvement.

Phases 1 and 2 will be performed in conjunction with two regional pilot projects the OFDT is undertaking in the Chicago, IL and El Paso, TX/Las Cruces, NM areas.  Accordingly, based on the anticipated costs, import to the DOJ missions, and the associated risks, the OFDT has selected the Rapid Application Development (RAD) work pattern, as defined in the DOJ Systems Development Life Cycle Guidance Document (See, http://www.usdoj.gov/jmd/irm/lifecycle/table.htm) as the appropriate work pattern to design and develop the Repository.

Development of the Repository is contingent upon Congressional approval of the President's budget request for the OFDT.  (See, S. 2778)

DISCLAIMER:  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Federal Detention Trustee.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Federal Detention Trustee to form a binding contract. The Federal Detention Trustee does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses or otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the use of such information.  All information received as a result of this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses will not be acknowledged or returned. Respondents may be invited to make an oral presentation to the Federal Detention Trustee concerning their response to this RFI.

As a result of this RFI, the OFDT may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an additional RFI.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the use of such information either as part of the evaluation process or in developing the specifications for any subsequent requirement.

SUBMISSIONS: Respondents may provide - but are not limited to providing - the following information: (1) a statement indicating interest and capability to perform the required tasks; (2) a statement describing the respondent's proposed technical approach to the identified tasks;  (3) suggestions regarding the Statement of Work or conceptual improvements to the project;  (4) suggestions for an appropriate schedule and/or development period;  and (5) suggestions for a fee schedule.

505th Command and Control Wing “Umbrella” Contract
30 Aug 04


The 505 Command and Control Wing (CCW), Hurlburt Field, Florida is in the process of examining an alternative acquisition strategy which would result in a single, comprehensive contract to support its needs for expertise in the Command and Control (C2) area as it relates to the 505 CCW mission - air and space C2 testing, training, distributed mission operations, and experimentation.  This concept is further explained below.   In order to develop sound acquisition strategies, we invite and encourage early industry participation in our efforts to conduct a successful and competitive source selection with the goal of providing the 505 CCW, its partners and customers with superior, cost-effective Advisory and Assistance Services support.  To that end, we would like you to engage as partners in our critical strategy, planning and document development process starting with early and meaningful exchanges of information.  The initial forum for these exchanges will be via email; however, an industry day is planned and will be advertised via the FedBizOpps website.  

Rules of Engagement. This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.  Any formal solicitation will be announced at a later date. This RFI is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Any costs associated with participating in these exchanges are at the expense of the company.  The Government will treat all parties neutrally whether or not they participate in exchanges.  There is no obligation on the part of the Government, nor will any contract result from these exchanges (reference Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201).  The formal source selection process starts at release of the request for proposal (RFP).  Until RFP release, the Government will proactively continue market research, industry exchanges, and maximize release of all strategies and information via the FedBizOpps website.  We are not seeking proprietary information as a result of these exchanges; however, if it is necessary to respond, please properly designate it.  The Government will follow the guidance of FAR 15.201(f) concerning information provided to/from industry.  The goal for these exchanges is to incorporate any strategies that provide added value. 

505 CCW Background & Overview.  On March 12, 2004 the Air Force Command and Control Training and Innovation Group was re-designated as the 505 CCW.  The wing is made up of the 505th Distributed Warfare Group (DWG), Kirtland AFB, NM; the 505th Operations Group (OG), Nellis AFB, NV; and the 505th Training Group (TRG), Hurlburt Field, FL.

The 505 CCW’s mission is to provide an operational air and space C2 center of excellence for the joint and coalition warfighter.  This is accomplished through initial and advanced training for Air & Space Operations Center (AOC) warfighters; Combat Air Forces C2 weapons systems operational testing; distributed mission operations combining live, virtual and constructive simulations; and development and documentation of AF operational tactics, techniques and procedures (AFOTTP) and other AOC documentation.  Bringing all of these capabilities together, the 505 CCW leads execution of CSAF’s biennial Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment (JEFX).

Unique resources assigned to 505 CCW include:
1.	Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) at Kirtland AFB
2.	Combined Air and Space Operations Center - Nellis (CAOC-N) at Nellis AFB
3.	AOC Simulator at Hurlburt Field
4.	USAF Professional Control Force.

Key programs of the 505 CCW include:
1.	Exercise BLUE FLAG
2.	Exercise VIRTUAL FLAG
3.	The Operational Command Training Program (OCTP)
4.	The AOC Formal Training Unit (FTU).  


Contract Background and Objective.    Multiple GSA or other contract vehicle task orders with no integration are providing the current contract support for the 505 CCW.  Management of these contracts imposes a significant administrative burden on Government personnel. The goal of the umbrella effort is to award a single contract to an integrating contractor or team that would report to the 505 CCW Commander.  This contractor would manage all contracted efforts across the 505 CCW (to include geographically dispersed units) and would execute the strategic direction laid about by 505 CCW/CC at a reduced total overall cost to the Government.  The contractor would manage in a “centralized management/decentralized execution” fashion to ensure sub-tier Commanders had maximum flexibility within the strategic direction in which to control their efforts.  Umbrella requirement is anticipated to result in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract or contracts with task orders carried out at various locations (primarily U.S. Air Force installations) worldwide.  Current efforts would be subsumed under the Umbrella contract at appropriate points.  The value of the current efforts is approximately $150 Million with potential growth up to $300 Million.  Potential NAICS code for this effort is 541710.  Potential users of this contract may be located at Hurlburt Field, Florida; Nellis AFB, Nevada; and Kirtland AFB, New Mexico.

General Description of Services.  Services under this comprehensive contract will include, but are not limited to the following:
·	Exercise and scenario planning
·	Exercise control planning and execution
·	Database and exercise product development
·	Modeling and simulation in an AOC environment
·	Modeling and simulation of airborne C2 and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) weapons systems
·	AOC initial qualification training
·	AOC continuation training

·	Integration of C2 core systems with internal and external communication infrastructures
·	Operation and training on specific C2 equipment and systems
·	JEFX support
·	Combat Air Forces (CAF) C2 systems and processes operational test and evaluation support 

Preliminary Risk Assessment.  Risks that have been identified by the government in a preliminary assessment are listed below:
·	Transition from incumbent contractors with no perturbations of workforce
·	Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel
·	Maintaining long term C2 qualified expertise
·	Increased efficiency of contract and reduced costs
·	Smooth operations in a fee for service environment
·	Central management, but geographically diverse execution


Market Research Questions. Considering the above information, please respond to the following questions in this preliminary exchange of information.  We would greatly appreciate any feedback that industry has to offer.  We request you respond with your comments in the order they are listed below.  It is not necessary to duplicate answers that relate to more than one question; please use cross-referencing.

1)	A long-term contract composed of one base year and subsequent option years is anticipated.  What contract types are commonly found in the private sector for this type of service?

2)	What types of performance incentives are used in the private sector for this kind of service? 

3)	How can the contract be structured to provide the most flexibility in balancing fluctuations in funding, exercise volume and training requirements?

4)	What NAICS code(s) would be appropriate for this effort?  Is this suitable for small business?  Is the effort diverse enough to warrant multiple contractors with different expertise?

5)	How can the requirement be structured to ensure an overall management structure that encompasses all task orders at all locations?

6)	What industry standards or commercial practices can be used as performance measures?

7)	Do you know of any contracts of a similar nature in the government or commercial sector?

8)	How would you recommend maintaining the current workforce?  What recommendations would you have for ensuring the long-term viability of a qualified workforce?

9)	The Air Force team is in the process of performing a formal risk identification.  What risks would you rank as having a high probability of impacting program success/performance?

10)	Can you implement a system that tracks the program, including costs to the hourly (or other appropriate) and trip level, and provide the government access to this system? 

11)	What contract types do you recommend to ensure proper risk sharing and incentives for superior performance?

12)	We anticipate awarding ‘umbrella’ contract(s) utilizing Performance Based Services Acquisition (PBSA) methods.  PBSA structures the acquisition around “what” is required as opposed to “how” the contractor should do the work and includes measurable performance objectives and financial or other incentives to encourage contractors to develop and institute innovative and cost effective methods of performing the work.  Please comment on this approach and how you suggest this be implemented for the umbrella.

13)	As stated, the Government intends to have multiple iterations with Industry.  For a pre-proposal conference, please give us your thoughts on the format of such a forum, and topics you would suggest?

14)	Please identify any potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) that are possible and prohibited by FAR Subpart 9.5.  Please comment on potential OCI issues and consider the multiple locations that may use this contract.  The Government expects to set up firewalls to avoid any OCI possibilities.

15)	What are the most critical work requirements that would distinguish a company’s capabilities from another?  Explain.

16)	What recommendations do you have for managing multiple funding streams and fee for service environment?

17)	What suggestions do you have for ensuring centralized management of tasks, but decentralized control at each possible user installation?

Other comments regarding the government’s course of action and /or alternatives you may offer are encouraged and appreciated.  We request that all written responses/comments be received by 4 pm, Central Standard Time, on 26 October 2004.  Thank you for your participation.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24 (June 2004).  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (AR&SC) intends to award a firm fixed price contract to Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. for Field Operation Center services.  This is a sole source procurement.  The period of performance shall be for one base year plus three option years.  

1.0.  INTRODUCTION.  The US Coast Guard (USCG) has been and continues to perform substantial depot-level repairs to their fleet of HH-60J aircraft at the Aircraft Repair & Supply Center (ARSC) HH60-J Product line, Elizabeth City, NC.  The USCG presently employs the use of ARSC technicians and Sikorsky artisans to perform these tasks.  The Sikorsky artisans are employed temporarily using task orders against a Sikorsky Sustaining Engineering contract.  As a result, the Coast Guard incurs travel and per diem costs associated with maintaining the team onsite.  In order to maintain present operational requirements, the USCG has requested a permanent twelve-man (12) team to supplement ARSC technicians performing depot level airframe repair tasks.  This will a) stabilize the augmented Sikorsky workforce onsite, and b) reduce overall costs to the Coast Guard while obtaining the same service level.

2.0.  SCOPE OF WORK.  The Contractor shall provide all necessary tools and labor to operate a depot level support team whose specialties shall include the repair and replacement of HH-60J major and minor airframe components, to include but not limited to, Main Transmission Beams, LH and RH Main Landing gear fittings, Tailcone and Tail Pylon bulkhead fittings, and all other airframe repairs directed by ARSC management.  Local ARSC Product Line Management and or their designees will determine the actual tasking.  All aircraft will be worked at USCG rent-free provided facilities at USCG Station Elizabeth City, NC with the exception of any off-site field repair requirement.  In that case the field team will perform in Government provided facilities that are environmentally friendly and safe and provided on a rent-free basis.  In addition, the Contractor shall provide any administrative and logistics requirements such as timekeeping, payroll, unrestricted material / shop supplies not supplied by USCG/ARSC, but required to perform the tasks.  All prerequisite removals and subsequent installation and checkout of components will be the responsibility of ARSC and or USCG personnel.  All aircraft and removed parts shall remain in the custody of ARSC and ARSC will be responsible for all aircraft logbook entries.

3.0.  APPLICABLE SPECIFICATION.  The ARSC repair taskings will be depot level maintenance in nature as defined by US Government Manuals H-60-CA/HA-SRM-000-400 and –100.  The Contractor shall have access to all necessary maintenance, rework and overhaul manuals, technical publications and applicable updates, performance/test/acceptance criteria and data to ensure that components are reworked/modified, calibrated and meet current specifications after task completion.

maintenance as necessary to meet current minimum functional performance specifications as required by paragraph 3.0.

4.1.  SITE ACTIVATION AND SUSTAINMENT.  The Contractor shall establish a full-time twelve-man (12) depot level maintenance team on location at ARSC, Elizabeth City, NC.  The team shall consist of eleven (11) aircraft sheetmetal technicians and 1 working team leader.  The team leader will act as a liaison between the Contractor and ARSC management personnel for all matters.  All repair tasks requirements will be directed through the team leader.

4.2.  STRUCTURAL REPAIRS.  The Contractor shall perform structural repairs and component replacement on OEM specific aircraft as directed by ARSC management via a weekly task requirement report.  The specific task description and associated required man-hours for these repairs will be annotated on the ARSC weekly task requirement.  Additional repairs found after/during the initial task repair requirement will be annotated and reported to ARSC maintenance management for disposition.  After completion of repairs, the aircraft will be reassembled by ARSC/USCG personnel. Any/all post assembly rigging/checkout requirements will be the responsibility of ARSC/USCG.

4.3.  ON-THE-JOB TRAINING:  The Contractor shall provide over-the-shoulder on-the-job training to ARSC personnel on a non-interference basis with the overall task.  This will be a non-certifiable type training and should be viewed by ARSC as familiarization of basic rework/repair procedures only.  

4.4.  TOOL CONTROL:  The Contractor shall be responsible to maintain a tool control program, which establishes policy and responsibilities for implementing, maintaining, controlling, storing, replacing, and inventorying common and special hand tools.  The tool control program shall be in compliance with ARSC Instruction 13600.1F “Aviation Tool Control Program”, 23 Apr 2004, as a minimum.  Any missing tool investigations will be provided in the biweekly report.

4.4.1.  EXPENDABLE TOOLS.  The Contractor shall be responsible for providing tools such as drill bits, abrasion wheels, wire brushes, paint brushes, gloves, etc. for their depot team when not readily available at the USCG E-City facility.

	4.5.  REPORTS:  The Contractor’s designated team leader shall provide a bi-weekly status report to ARSC management indicating such information as work in progress, completed tasks, logistics/material deficiencies, and parts requirements.  The bi-weekly status report will also be used to document any schedule delays and long lead material requirements.  
	
4.6.  HAZARDOUS MATERIAL:  The Contractor shall follow all approved procedures for the storage, inventory, use and disposal of hazardous material.  

4.7. TRAVEL:  Any depot team travel requirements for repairs in locations other than ARSC

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

               Performance Work Statement
1.0.  INTRODUCTION.  This requirement defines tasks for obtaining parts and services needed for the overhaul of the Pump Module Assemblies and associated component parts that are utilized on the Coast Guard fleet of HH-60J aircraft.  Funding for this contract will be provided from annual operating guide 41.00, Funds for Aircraft Maintenance.

2.0.  SCOPE OF WORK.  On an “as required basis”, the contractor shall provide all necessary parts, material, labor, tooling, test equipment and facilities to evaluate and overhaul systems and subsystems of the HH-60J helicopter Pump Module Assemblies, as necessary to conform with the requirements of this Performance Work Statement (PWS), at the firm fixed prices specified in Section B.  
This PWS establishes the minimum requirements necessary to overhaul the Pump Module Assemblies.  Required overhaul is to be accomplished in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.  Parker-Hannifin Inc. is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The contractors shall provide their own manuals as the Coast Guard does not own nor can it provide this data.
In order to perform necessary overhaul to components listed in Schedule B, the contractor must have access to the parts and data furnished directly by the OEM.  Proposals shall include evidence of the foregoing access.  Piece parts shall be new parts manufactured or approved by the OEM.  Data includes complete overhaul manuals and service bulletins of the latest revisions required to perform necessary overhaul to components listed in Schedule B.

3.0.  APPLICABLE SPECIFICATIONS.  The following technical and operational directives are applicable to this requirement but are not deliverable under this contract.  Except where otherwise noted, the latest revision in effect as of contract award date applies. The information contained in this section is not intended to be all-inclusive nor to detract from or modify procedures outlined in the manufacturers drawings, specifications and service bulletins, except where specifically noted herein. 

3.1. MANUFACTURERS DRAWING AND SPECIFICATIONS:  The contractor shall have access to the latest required maintenance, overhaul manuals, and Original Equipment Manufacturer's Drawings, Specifications and Service Bulletins to ensure that equipment is overhauled, calibrated and operating in accordance with latest manufacturer's performance/test/acceptance specification criteria.  Drawings and specifications are proprietary and are not available from the Coast Guard.  Coast Guard does not possess nor can it supply the aforementioned.  The offeror will be responsible for obtaining all data.

3.2.  SERVICE BULLETINS:  The contractor shall be required to incorporate service bulletins issued prior to the date of contract if not previously accomplished.  The service bulletins will fall under overhaul to be accomplished in accordance with Original Equipment Manufacturer's latest commercial build standard and shall be included in the proposed overhaul price.
  
New service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this contract may create new part number configurations, i.e., Class II changes, which will not change form, fit or function, will be replaced on an attrition basis unless directed by an Airworthiness Directive.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the overhaul contract.  If applicable, contractor will provide within the 30-day period a flat rate overhaul price for the new part number to cover the remaining option years.  Superseded parts, which have been removed, and replaced by new part number configurations are to be scrapped at contractor's facility in the presence of a DCMAO inspector or Coast Guard designated COTR.

4.0.  DEFINITIONS.  For the purpose of this contract, the following definitions apply:

4.1.  OVERHAUL:  To restore to original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) minimum functional performance specifications by disassembling, inspection, overhaul, assembly and testing of parts or components in accordance with OEM's current specifications and procedures.

4.2.  REPLACEMENT:  The substitution of a scrapped, consumable item with a new item manufactured or approved by the OEM or an unserviceable item which cannot be overhauled in accordance with OEM specifications shall be replaced with new parts manufactured or approved by the OEM.  Other than new replacement parts will need prior Contracting Officer approval.

4.3.  UNUSUAL DAMAGE:  Items which have been severely damaged due to mishandling, mechanical failure or crash damage, or in which assemblies have been cannibalized.  Items, which are missing consumable components, that are required to be replaced during overhaul, are not considered to be unusually damaged.

4.4.  CANNIBALIZED:  Components listed in Section B for which integral parts are missing when the component is provided to the contractor for overhaul.

4.5.  MODIFICATION:  To make basic or fundamental changes on items specified in the schedule of components when required by the Contracting Officer.  The vendor shall also include the part number affixed to the modification.  The contractor must be able to perform upgrades/modifications at the same time as the OEM, if contractor is other than the OEM.

4.6.  B.E.R. Beyond Economical Overhaul:  Items requiring overhaul to the extent that the total cost to overhaul exceeds 75% of the OEM’s new replacement cost, will be considered B.E.R.

4.7.  AOG:  An  “Aircraft on the Ground” condition, indicating that an otherwise operational aircraft is temporarily grounded awaiting overhaul and return of the part or component.  This condition requires the component be handled as a high priority, and that its return be expedited.

4.8.	QUALIFICATION OF PIECE PARTS:  The aircraft engine, and its components are 
considered “flight safety critical aircraft parts”.  The use of piece parts or components other than OEM or DOD approved parts is prohibited without prior express written approval of the Contracting Officer.

shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing, providing the following information:  (1) date the reparable(s) received; (2) confirmation of serial number(s); (3) confirmation of delivery order number.  Notification via facsimile is acceptable.  If ACMS tracked, identify at this time any components requiring configuration upgrading (modification).  Ensure SCHR and CCRR correspond with component and conduct an inspection IAW manufacturer's specifications.  In addition, when the component is received at the overhaul facility receiving dock, the contractor shall report any preservation or packaging discrepancies, missing parts or assemblies, cannibalized items or unusual damage to the Contracting Officer.

5.1.1.1.  Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) Tracked Material:  If a component is ACMS tracked material the contractor shall; 

5.1.1.1.1.  Review the Significant Component History Record (SCHR) for Gas Turbine Assemblies for accuracy and completion.  Report any preservation or packaging discrepancies or missing parts to the Contracting Officer.

5.1.1.1.2.  Initiate a Contract Component Overhaul Record (CCRR) on serial number tracked parts.  The form entry must include the specific reason for component rejection, both primary and secondary if applicable.

5.1.1.1.3.   Annotate CCRR, listing Service Bulletins, which have been incorporated.

5.1.1.2.  Missing Components:  Within 30 calendar days after receipt of a component, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing of any missing detail part(s) or sub-assembly(ies).  The Contracting Officer shall then have 45 calendar days to provide formal disposition instructions to the contractor.  The U. S. Coast Guard will be responsible to replace the missing detail part with an RFI or repaired detail part.  A revised contract delivery schedule will be negotiated.

 5.1.1.3.  Cannibalized Components:  Upon receiving components exhibiting cannibalization, the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR and discontinue all actions until the Contracting Officer determines to proceed with the overhaul/overhaul.  DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR shall witness the remaining teardown and inspection of the component and shall be responsible for signing and dating the Contractor’s letter of notification.  DCMAO’s or Coast Guard designated COTR’s signature does not infer acceptance, only acknowledges the claim.  The letter of notification and the inspection/teardown report shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for disposition.  If overhaul is subsequently authorized, the contractor shall follow the procedures outlined in 5.2.

5.1.1.4.	Unusual Damage:  When components are received and the contractor's inspection
indicates obvious misuse, unusual or severe damage, the contractor shall discontinue all actions until a DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR is notified and personally witnesses the continuance of inspection and tear down.  The DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR will be responsible to sign and date the Contractor's Unusual Damage Claim Request.

5.1.1.4.1.  The contractor shall, within fifteen calendar days from date the DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR witnesses the unusual damage, notify the Contracting Officer that the item is considered unusually damaged and requires an unusual damage evaluation.

 5.1.1.4.2.  The contractor shall, within thirty days from DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR verification, submit an Unusual Damage Report and a detailed breakdown covering all parts and overhaul needed to return the unit to the manufacturer's minimum performance specifications.  The detailed breakdown shall contain the National Stock Number (NSN), Part Number (P/N), Nomenclature, serial number, cost breakdown, and a list of replacement parts and disposition of each.  The proposal shall not include the work involved in the tear down/inspection process, as this would have been covered under the firm fixed teardown price.

 5.1.1.4.3.  Within thirty calendar days of receipt of Unusual Damage Report and proposal, the Contracting Officer will either authorize or deny overhaul or initiate negotiations.  Upon mutual agreement as to price, the delivery order will be modified by a supplemental agreement.  If it is in the Coast Guard's best interest not to have material overhauled, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with disposition instructions to return the material to the Aircraft Repair & Supply Center.   NOTE:  The contractor is at sole risk if material is overhauled prior to Contracting Officer's approval to commence overhaul.

5.2.	 OVERHAUL:  The Contractor shall make necessary repairs to unserviceable
components to return to a serviceable condition as set forth in accordance with Section 2.0 this PWS.  Replace only those parts found missing or defective.  Parts of a component found to be in a serviceable condition as a result of inspection and functional testing shall be reused.

5.2.1.	BEYOND ECONOMICAL REPAIR REQUIREMENT:  The contractor shall provide
actual component repair breakdown and costs when overhaul of the material exceeds 75% of the OEM's new replacement cost. This information will be forwarded to the Contracting Officer who will provide final disposition.   

5.2.2.  NON-REPAIRABLE DETAIL PARTS:  The contractor shall dispose of any part
removed as non-repairable during the overhaul or modification process in accordance with the current ISO 9002 certified procedures.  All ACMS tracked detailed components shall be properly documented on the Disenrollment Card #2572020,submitted IAW Section 5.1.1.1.2.

5.2.3.  CORROSION:  Coast Guard aircraft operate primarily in a saltwater environment and are subject to corrosion. The contractor is advised to expect corrosion on equipment to be overhauled under this requirement. During inspection and functional test, the presence of corrosion in an assembly or component thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection. Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected. Corroded parts shall be replaced except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas shall be accomplished in accordance with OEM's current specifications and drawings, or shall meet the Contracting Officer's approval when OEM specifications do not exist or are not clear. The contractor shall provide for effects of and removal of corrosion in the firm-fixed overhaul price.

5.3.	ASSEMBLY AND PERFORMANCE TEST:  The contractor shall reassemble all
components upon completion of overhaul and conduct a performance test in accordance with the applicable directive(s) cited in Section 3.0.  The contractor shall record the results of all performance tests and provide this documentation to the government upon request.
