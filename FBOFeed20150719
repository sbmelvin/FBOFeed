<DESC>This announcement serves as a Sources Sought synopsis issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.

DO NOT submit a quote or proposal in response to this synopsis. <br />For the purpose of this acquisition, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is -334290- other communications equipment manufacturing.<br />USARJ and I Corps (Forward) provides strategic and tactical Signal capabilities in support of PACOM, I Corps, USARPAC, USFK and USFJ missions, priorities and objectives. While postured to provide Pacific Land War Net systems in support of PACOM OPLANs and CONPLANs, the interoperability between U.S. Army Radios and those of the Japan Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF) is non-existent in the secure domain.<br />USARJ and I Corps (Forward) require a(n) interface that would allow secure tactical radio communications between both (U.S. and Japan) Armies utilizing pre-existing combat net radio infrastructure. This would allow the U.S. Army to continue utilizing encrypted, frequency hop capability with common/standardized tactical radio systems employed by the majority of U.S. military units with the Japanese secure radio systems commonly used by Japanese units. This would greatly enhance USARJ's solution for initial entry communications capability for short/no-notice Humanitarian Assistance Disaster Relief (HADR) and contingency missions. <br />Additionally, any radio interface or approved Army solution fielded to this requirement MUST be fully accredited and interoperable within the PACOM/JAPAN AORs. The requested capability would be employed to provide single-channel secure tactical communications between US and JGSDF elements.<br />The Contractor shall provide the following:<br />(1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address. <br />(2) Under which NAICS does your company usually provide services/supplies identified above?

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ___ ) are, ( ___ ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ___ ) Have, ( ___ ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ___ ) Are, ( ___ ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ___ ) Have, ( ___ ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p><br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

To avoid having to work with different contractors for O&M, Grounds Maintenance and Snow/Ice Removal at 3 different sites, the requirement was combined into this one new consolidated contract.           <br>                    <br>          --- END OF CHANGE 7 ---          <br>                    <br>          CHANGE 6 - The following information are incorporated herein:           <br>                      <br>           1) The Government is intending to conduct a Pre-Solicitation Conference (as opposed to the previously planned Pre-Proposal Conference) and Site Visit to Germersheim, Gruenstadt and Coleman Barracks.
