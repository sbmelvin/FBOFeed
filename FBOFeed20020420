<DESC>The Tongass National Forest previously posted notice of intent to award a sole source firm fixed-price contract for the replacement of a leaking hydraulic cylinder for a freight elevator in the U.S. Forest Service warehouse located in Sitka, Alaska.  Responses to that notice indicate there are sufficient potential providers for this work to warrant conducting a competitive acquisition via a Request for Quotes.  The work includes replacing the existing cylinder of an ESCO elevator (machine no. 906381) with a new cylinder with sealed PVC protection.  The work includes removal of the underground equipment, excavation and drilling to accommodate the new equipment, and furnishing and installation of the new cylinder.  This acquisition is subject to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program and is thus open to all businesses regardless of size.  The contract time will be 60 days after the effective date of the notice to proceed.  The estimated price range for this acquisition is $25,000 - $100,000.  The solicitation will be uploaded to the FedBizOpps website on or about May 6, 2002.  Potential quoters are requested to obtain the solicitation via the Internet if at all possible. Alternatively, a hard copy of the solicitation documents may be requested via fax at 907.228.6254. Fax requests should reference solicitation KTN-02-08.  Telephone requests for either the solicitation or to be placed on a mailing list cannot be honored.  NOTE TO POTENTIAL QUOTERS: THE ZIP CODE STATED ABOVE FOR THE TONGASS NATIONAL FOREST IS INCORRECT.  THE CORRECT ZIP CODE IS 99901.
