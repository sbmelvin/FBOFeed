<CONTACT>Elayne Gomes-Battle, 202-267-5814
<DESC>Sources Sought Anthropometric Measurements of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Transportation System Specialists (ATSSs) This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Human Factors Design Standard provides a wide range of anthropometric data to be used in the design of FAA systems, equipment, and facilities.  However, this data is based on measurements taken on Department of Defense (DoD) military personnel.  Some of the data is based on surveys and studies that were conducted over 50 years ago.  Furthermore, the use of DoD data may not be applicable to the FAA's Air Transportation System Specialist (ATSS) workforce.  To that end, it is desirable to collect anthropometric measurements from members of the ATSS workforce.   The FAA is seeking potential sources that have the ability to conduct such measurements.  The effort entails determination of the required sample size, develop data collection sheets, perform the required data collection, analyze the data collected, and prepare an update to the FAA Human Factors Design Standard based on the results.  It is envisioned that there will be 25-30 measurements per individual. The contractor will be required to travel to various FAA sites (potentially up to 25) to perform the data collection.  These site visits will be coordinated by the FAA.  In order to minimize the time that the ATSS personnel need to be away from their duties, it is envisioned that there will be separate stations established; one for standing measurements and one for seated measurements.  Personnel to measure the individuals as well as record the data will be required at each station.  In addition, as measurements will be made on female personnel, at least one female measurer will be required.    All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense. All interested parties must have thorough knowledge of the FAA Human Factors Design Standards, HF-STD-001 and experience in taking anthropometric measurements.   Parties that can meet this requirement should reply via email, by close of business January 12, 2006 to the Contract Specialist, Elayne.Gomes-Battle@faa.gov.  All submissions are limited to 10 pages.

<RESPDATE>033006
<ARCHDATE>04292006
<CONTACT>RITA MCNAIR, 202.267.8093
<DESC>Brief abstract:  The FAA controllers currently use an audio path for the Air/Ground (A/G) communications between control facilities and remote radio communication facilities to communicate with aircraft. Pursuant to AMS policy 3.2.2.4, the FAA is notifying the public that it is our intent to extend the period of performance under General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S) contract DTFA01-97-D-03005 for an additional three (3) years under the authority of AMS Section 3.2.2.4.1, Single Source Selection Procurement Process, subpart 3.2.2.4.1.2, Non-emergencies.  The contract period of performance will be from June 14, 2006, through June 13, 2009.  The estimated cost of the contract modification exceeds $100,000. After reading the technical and programmatic requirements listed below, interested parties who have the requisite capabilities to fulfill this requirement are invited to submit a letter of interest and capability statement describing the equipment and wherewithal to maintain this FAA RCE equipment, once fielded, to rita.mcnair@faa.gov no later than January 27, 2006.   Currently the FAA has fielded approximately 18,000 units of RCE through the National Airspace System (NAS).  The FAA requires similar equipment to provide voice and control signals between switches at the control sites and radios at the remote sites.  The total requirement over the 3-year period is estimated to be an additional 800 to 1200 units (400 to 600 channels, half control and half remote units).  The additional equipment will support the Communication Facility Enhancement (CFE), Air Traffic Organization (ATO-T), and sustain future Radio Control Equipment (RCE) program requirements. This product needs to be capable of interfacing to all the FAA switch types without any modification to existing interfaces, and capable of interfacing to FAA radios at the remote sites without any modifications. The vendor's RCE needs to be capable of providing voice and control signals from the control site to the remote site and vice versa with a minimum telecommunication path of one VG6 grade line or equivalent. At a minimum, the vendor's RCE should be able to provide the following: â€¢	Audio and control signals path both in transmit and receive direction. â€¢	Support two separate frequencies. â€¢	Cold (manual switching) and hot backup (automatic switching without any loss of the air traffic controller's message) communication between the control and remote sites. â€¢	Push-to-talk (PTT) signaling. â€¢	Squelch break and AGC signals. â€¢	Muting audio both at the control and remote sites. â€¢	Adjustable attenuation of audio with adjustable timing at the remote sites for the purpose of alleviating the receiver's pop back. â€¢	Main/Standby (M/S) signaling to switch between main and standby radios. â€¢	Primary/back-up operation (one control site controlling one remote site). â€¢	Dual control operation (two separated control sites capable of controlling/sharing one remote site). â€¢	Separated Transmitter and Receiver operation (One control site controlling two separated remote sites). â€¢	Split Voice and Data operation (separate path for each voice and data instead of data over voice). â€¢	Ability to Emulate 2 RCEs  â€¢	Semi-split frequency operation (when only one frequency is communicating at a time be able to route that received audio frequency from the remote site to only the same frequency output at the control site. â€¢	Remote Maintenance Monitoring (RMM), control and monitoring of the RCE channels remotely. â€¢	Interface connectors in the front and back panel of the equipment to interface with the FAA MDTs and the Centralized Maintenance System (CMS) - presently DB-9 connectors. â€¢	Compatible with the current FAA RCE CMS operation (control and monitoring). The vendor is required to provide Logistical Support, Technical Services, Training and a 10-year warranty to support the equipment.  In addition, the contractor will also be responsible for Engineering and Technical Support services to include, but not limited to, the following for future RCE units: â€¢	Technical Instruction Books (TIBs) modifications â€¢	Configuration Control Management â€¢	Status reports, monthly exchange and repair (E&R) line replacement unit (LRU) reports â€¢	Failure Reporting â€¢	LRU Repair

Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<SOLNBR>FA8601-06-R-0025
<ARCHDATE>04062006
<CONTACT>Susan Slivinski, 937-257-6146 ext. 4216
<DESC>IMAGING FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROMETER.   This announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action in accordance with FAR  5.203(a). The Government intends to issue a Request for Proprosal (RFP)  for the acquisition of one (1) each Fast Scanning, Imaging (staring, non  scanning) Fourier Transform Spectrometer in the mid-infrared range with  high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution.   Spectrometer will be  used in faculty and student research such as remote sensing of battlefield  conditions and bomb phenomenology research.  The Air Force is developing a  database for Infrared (IR) signatures to be used in a variety of  applications.  Knowledge of the IR signatures is essential to determine  battlefield operations.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, on behalf of the Joint Program Executive Office for Joint Tactical Radio System and the Joint Waveform Program Office (JWPO) intends to award a sole source contract, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1, to ITT Aerospace/Communications Division, 1919 West Cook Road, Fort Wayne IN 46801 to complete the development of the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW).  SRW is a Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant software defined waveform to operate primarily in small form factor, battery-operated JTRS radios, which is to provide a mobile ad-hoc networking capability for land combat operations.  This waveform will support voice, video, and data communications in the immediate area of operations and will be able to interface with the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) for long-haul operations.  The first operational spiral build of SRW will be based on Increments 1.0 - 2.1 completed under the CERDEC Other Transaction Agreement with ITT, a  follow-on to the DARPA developed Soldier Level Integrated Communication Environment (SLICE), which has been field tested and demonstrated.  The Government intends to issue a request for proposal to ITT.  Questions pertaining to this acquisition should be addressed to Ms. Trelli Davis, (619) 524-7181 or email trelli.davis@navy.mil within 45 days of the initial posting of this announcement.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure on a sole-source basis with Technical Resources International Inc. (TRI) under the authority of FAR 6.302 for
computerized information support services to maintain and enhance the Chemical  carcinogenesis Research Information System (CCRIS).  The mission of the NLM Division of Specialized Information Services is to: (1) provide selected core toxicology and environmental health information resources and services; (2) facilitate access to national and international toxicology and environmental health information resources; and (3) strengthen the information infrastructure of toxicology and environmental health.  The CCRIS database is an integral component of NLM’s mission to provide biomedical information.  As a primary user and disseminator of the CCRIS data, NLM wishes to transition the responsibility for CCRIS from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to NLM.  NLM will be unable to fulfill this component of its mission without continuation of the current highly efficient and effective computerized information services support.
		
CCRIS (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System) is an online database originally created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  In 1985, CCRIS was mounted on the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) system, and the database was maintained using TOXNET data input software.  The database contains data and results of research studies for over 9000 chemical compounds. The chemical - specific data fall into the selected areas of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, tumor promotion, and tumor inhibition.  Full bibliographic references are also included in addition to specific indexing. 

The Contractor shall maintain and enhance the CCRIS database which resides, and may be searched, on the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET System. The input for this data base
comes from several sources such as:

- Surveillance and review of the published literature (e.g., CASelects)
- IARC Monographs
- NCI/NTP Toxicity and Bioassay Reports
- Applicable database searches

The Contractor shall survey these sources and evaluate pertinent data in accordance with the established evaluation criteria.  At the direction of the Project Officer, the Contractor shall enter
suitable studies on chemicals into the CCRIS database.

The software for the maintenance and update of the CCRIS database on the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET System will be provided by the National Library of Medicine.

General process for CCRIS record building:

A Senior Scientist (Ph.D.) reviews published literature and results of database searches (typically abstracts) and selects potential studies.

An Information Specialist (B.S.) acquires copies of full reports/studies online (e.g., Docline) and at local libraries.  The citations, with a unique reference code, are also added to the reference file and retained for future use.
A Senior Scientist reviews the full reports/studies and determines if the report/study meets the established evaluation criteria.  If determined to be relevant and acceptable, the Senior Scientist codes the relevant data from the study onto standardized code sheets.

The code sheets and the full report/study are reviewed for scientific accuracy and completeness by an expert Peer Reviewer (Ph.D.).  Questions and issues are resolved with the Senior Scientist.

An Information Specialist enters the data from the code sheets into CCRIS using TOXNET’s SSEUS data entry system.

A Staff Scientist (M.S.) double-checks (quality control/quality assurance) the data entered against the original code sheets.  Any questions or discrepancies are resolved with the Senior Scientist.  

The log of the period’s activity is sent to and reviewed by the Project Manager.  When approved, the Project Manager notifies NLM staff that the entered data is ready for public release.

Monthly reports are generated that reflect monthly activities and related costs.
				
TRI has provided expert information services support, through an NCI contract, to maintain and enhance the CCRIS database since its inception on the TOXNET system in 1985.  TRI has established a strong working relationship with NLM and uniquely understands the utilization of CCRIS data by the scientific community.  TRI’s previous 21 years of experience with NCI and NLM have proven critical to the success of the CCRIS database.  This experience with NLM and NLM’s SSEUS data entry system uniquely qualifies TRI as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary services.  Therefore there will be no time lost with the usual learning curve or start-up processes.  It is determined that TRI is the only available source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience to successfully complete the above requirements.  Due to time constraints and a compelling need to avoid gaps in the maintenance and enhancement of CCRIS, TRI’s continued service is considered a crucial component to the transition of the CCRIS database from NCI to NLM. 

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisitions of Non-Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) business days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information. NLM Synopsis No. NLM 06-053/RHW.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Robin Hope-Williams, Contract Specialist, NLM on (301) 496-6546.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the following: QTY 3 ea. - ABI-PCI Multi-function 1553 interface, PCI bus QTY 2 ea. - ABI-PMC Mult-function 1533 interface, PMC module. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from SBS Technologies in accordance with the requirement of FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source. These cards are for new copies of existing system. These cards are the only cards that will work with software that has already been custom-developed, using the SBS ABI software library.  The current software will not work with other cards, because they use a different software library. The card would have to be rewritten if another vendor was chosen. Changing to a different card would expose the project to risk of new undocumented behavior, with consequential project delay and cost. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. e.s.t on the date listed above. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

This is a high temperature (up to 200 degree C)  water-titanium loop heat pipe for SiC device cooling in military fighter  aircraft environment. Proof-of-concept Titanium/Water Hoop Heat Pipe (LHP) Summary of Requirements: Operating around 200 degree C Heat sink temperature: 5 to 140 degree C. (Water freezes at 0 degree C) Environment:  5 to 200 degree C.  (Water freezes at 0 degree C) Heat Load:  500W at 3W/cm2.  Goal is 5,000W at 30W/cm2 Evaporator configuration:  1” OD, up to 10” long.  Saddle design TBD Compensation chamber:  TBD Condenser Configuration:  TBD Transport distance between evaporator and condenser:  up to 2m.  Desired  to have flexible transport lines to allow dimensional flexibility for  testing purpose.  Contractor will explore various means to accommodate  this. Work Plan: Task 1:  LHP Design.  This involves finalizing the design requirements  with AFRL, performing thermal and mechanical design, and selecting  evaporator/condenser/transport section materials.  While the evaporator  envelope and wick material will be titanium, alternative material choices  will be evaluated to provide the flexible transport lines and the  condenser.  At the end of Task 1, a design review will be held with AFRL  to approve the LHP design Task 2:  LHP Fabrication.  This involves fabricating the LHP evaporator,  condenser and transport sections according to the design in Task 1.  The  LHP will be passivated and processed following a procedure similar to  standard ammonia LHP fabrication procedures.  It is noted the ammonia LHP  fabrication procedure will be modified to accommodate the special  requirements for titanium systems. Task 3:  LHP Testing.  Due to the funding limit, very limited testing will  be conducted.  This includes proof pressure test (for structural safety)  and basic performance test in air (slight oxidation will occur to the  titanium outer surface).  The basic performance test will verify the  two-phase fluid circulation, not the actual heat transport performance. Project period of performance 3 months. for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one  source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1.  The proposed source is  Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc.

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, the Operations and Maintenance Contractor for the NCI Frederick Cancer Research Facility will be soliciting for the services described herein on behalf of the NCI and the NHGRI.  The NCI and NHGRI have agreed to pursue a three year pilot  - The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  A sine qua non for the pilot project is high quality human biospecimens.  The term “high quality” refers not only the histological and molecular properties of the tissue, but also to characteristics such as degree and quality of clinical annotation, appropriately informed consent and IRB protocol, as well as unencumbered contractual status (MTA or IP restrictions).  To ensure the rapid availability, highest quality, and uniformity of the biological specimens for the project, the NCI proposes to establish a centralized Biospecimen Resource Center (BRC) that would acquire material from existing cancer tissue repositories that have been pre-identified as part of an earlier NCI request for information (RFI) seen at the URL (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-06-002.html).  In addition, the centralized facility will have a role in evaluating for suitability to the TCGA other existing repositories for potential acquisition of their biospecimens.  The centralized facility will provide ongoing services for importing the materials from such repositories, processing those materials into molecular derivatives, and distributing those derivatives to the various analytical sites.  The BRC will also develop, implement and publish standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all processes of cancer tissue sample acquisition, preparation, storage, and distribution, including operating and QA/QC procedures that can be validated.  Biospecimen types will include tumor tissue, and normal cell sources such as blood and/or buccal cells.  The BRC will also establish SOPs for prospective collections of other tumor types, and develop new protocols for extracting molecular isolates from tissues in synchrony with new analytical procedures being developed within the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) framework.  The RFP is intended to solicit responses from parties interested in providing centralized biorepository and biospecimen services to the joint NCI and NHGRI - The Cancer Genome Atlas.  Only one contract will be issued.

If the above listed URL is not available, please notify jlewis@ncifcrf.gov for the text version of the URL.

Interested potential sources are to submit a letter of interest with their point of contact information to Jeanne Lewis, email: jlewis@ncifcrf.gov.  We are expecting release of the RFP in the next few weeks.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) intends to procure on a sole source basis with a small business company; ProModel Corporation, 556 East Technology Ave, OREM, UT 84097-8110, USA.  The services are for Technical Support beginning 20 Jan 06 through 19  Jan 11, to evolve the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) Synchronization Tool (AST) prototype into an official system of record.  ARFORGEN is a new force management process instituted by the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) to synchronize the manning, equip ping, training and resourcing functions inherent in generating Army units for worldwide use.  The ARFORGEN Synchronization Tool requirement has now become very critical and the timelines for the services are very stringent.  Further development of a new to ol that is not within the Armys inventory would delay in fulfilling FORSCOMs requirements.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide all the services that will satisfy its requirement, based on the responses provided after Sy nopsis for Sources Sought on FED BIZ OPPS Announcement dated 02 16 Dec 05 and other independent Market Research.  This notice will close on 13 Jan 06 at 3:00pm.

<DESC>Solicitation was originally announced as N1460060026.  This requirement is not sufficiently large to expect that it will be a formal contract.  The solicitation is thus being issued as an RFQ, with the identification Q1460060026.  An award will be made for one year service, with the option of four additional years.  As this procurement is set aside for Very Small Businesses, and FAR Clause 52.219-05 identifies eligibility for "Very Small Businesses" as those headquartered within specific SBA Districts, only those firms headquartered in Casper, WY, Boise, ID or Salt Lake City, UT will be considered as eligible for consideration.

<DESC>USDA Forest Service, Fire and Aviation Support Branch, at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, anticipates soliciting via a Request for Proposals for fully operated multi-engine aircraft with pilot for use in transporting passengers and deploying smokejumpers and paracargo. A total of four (4) aircraft are needed, one for each of four core bases of operation located at Grangeville Air Center, Grangeville, Idaho; West Yellowstone IA Fire Center, West Yellowstone, Montana; North Cascades Smokejumper Base, Winthrop, Washington; and the Region 5 Smokejumper base in Redding, California. All responsible offerors may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Forest Service. The Government intends setting aside this procurement 100% for small business. The NAICS code is 481211 with a size standard of 1500 employees. The duration of each contract is comprised of a base year, which shall be a one-year period commencing from date of contract award.  Up to 4 one-year optional performance periods are contemplated for each contract. The total duration of each contract shall not exceed five years. The mandatory availability period for each aircraft is approximately from early June to late September of each contract period. The actual availability period for an individual aircraft may vary from 93 to 119 calendar days depending on the scheduled requirement for each base of operation. 

Vendors are hereby advised that hard-copy notices, solicitations, or mailing lists are no longer issued or maintained by the National Interagency Fire Center.  Therefore, it is imperative that prospective offerors monitor the FedBizOpps website periodically if they wish to view and download the solicitation and participate timely. The anticipated date for the issue and publication of the RFP for this solicitation in FedBizOpps is within 45 days of the original posting of this pre-solicitation notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   Amendment 1: The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions proposed by vendors regarding the synopsis/request for quote.  The questions and answers are as follows. Question 1. Can you amplify 7. Auto-montage capability - does this mean computer control of the  microscope either through sample translation or beam shifting to form montage images or simply the ability to automatically make a montages image from an appropriate series of images?  The 1200EX does not have an automated stage there for what we need is software aided montaging capability. The  operator will need to manually reposition the scope then with the aid of the software, have the ability to montage the collection together. We would like to however leave the option open for true auto-montaging if the camera system were eventually moved to a scope with computer stage control  capability.  Question 2.  Can the field of view exceed that of film?  Yes, as long as there is no compromise of pixel size (too big or too small). We would like to be in the 15um range. 1:1 optics would be preferable.  Question 3.  Since all vacuum seals that require outside motion are sliding, be  it rotary or linear, what is the intent of point #9?  The intent of the request was to have rotary insertion mechanism rather than a linear sliding seal which could transfer contaminants or leak air into the column. Question 4. Is there anything mounted below the microscope's film camera? Would a  bottom mounted camera that met or exceeded all of the other specifications including the field of view requirement be considered ? No there is nothing mounted below the camera but a side mounted camera is preferable to avoid contaminants which have the propensity to find their way to the bottom  mounted screens.  The response date for this Synopsis/RFQ is Jan. 12, 2005 at 5:00PM.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check FEDBIZOPPS for updates or changes.  No hard copies will be available.

NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small bF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside.

NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAusiness  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks.

<DESC>The Mid-Pacific Region of the Bureau of Reclamation is conducting a market survey in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.001 to obtain feedback from industry regarding the general requirements for an upcoming procurement . THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. It is a market research tool to determine potential sources and interested parties in the intended five-year procurement to provide Aerial Photography and Mapping Services under multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for the Bureau of Reclamation's Mid-Pacific Region which covers most of California and parts of Oregon and Nevada (see www.usbr.gov/mp/regionalmap.html for a regional map).  These professional services are for documentation and other non-design purposes and include aerial photography  solely for documentation purposes, e.g., gravel/sediment transport, high/low flows and levels, major events (floods, seepage, slides) and aerial photography and/or mapping which will not result in design or construction, e.g., biologic, archeologic, environmental, and geologic mapping; preliminary investigations (appraisal level and feasibility studies); and inundation studies for real estate (appraisal level and feasibility studies). If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on http://ideasec.nbc.gov. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  This procurement is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns; however, ALL interested parties are requested to respond. If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or on an unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled. Therefore, replies are requested from all interested parties, regardless of business size or category.

<DESC>15 CONS/LGCB is seeking information from industry that will assist in a strategic planning initiative associated with the 15th Air Wing proposal of providing a temporary hanger at Hickam AFB, HI. Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: 

Identification of sources and interested parties,  to provide a temporary structure by lease, to include installation, and eventual removal at end of lease.  Size of structure to be as a minimum, 210 feet by 200 feet with 36 feet high sidewalls. The structure will be used as a hanger for general maintenance of Air Force C-17 Cargo Aircraft. The aircraft as 174 feet long, height at main body is 25 feet and at the tail is 55 feet. The aircraft is 170 feet wide, wing tip to wing tip.   It is anticipated the structure would require a steel frame with fabric covering sides and walls.  Materials will have to be flame retardant.  The structure would be required to meet IBC 2000 building code based on a live load of 12 PSF, basic steady wind speed of 90 mph and a 3 psf collateral load.  Material test certificate would be required.  The structure would require a hanger door system to be eclectically operated to allow for complete closing of the structure.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources for services in support of the Security, Intelligence, and Special Programs Deputate (MDA/SI).  MDA intends to utilize its Basic Support Services Program (BSSP) General Services Administration (GSA) ordering procedures to acquire the services described in this notice (information on the MDA BSSP may be found at http://www.mda.mil/barbb/setaserv.htm).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) category for this requirement is 541710 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHYSICAL, ENGINEERING, AND LIFE SCIENCES, with a size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is open to all GSA schedule holders; however, the Government reserves the right to solicit only small businesses if a sufficient number are determined to possess the required capabilities.  MDA is seeking business firms under GSA schedule contract sources to support staff augmentation for approximately three (3) on-site staff in support of Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) and Geo-spatial Intelligence services.  Based on mission requirements, there is a potential for the number of personnel to increase.  Due to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, there is the potential for the location of the support requirements to be moved to other geographically dispersed locations during the contract period.  Based on capability statements submitted in response to this notice, the Government will invite only the “most highly qualified” companies to participate in the competition. GSA schedule holders judged best qualified to compete for the work will be sent a draft Request for Quotations package within two (2) weeks of the deadline for submission of capability statements and invited to schedule “1-on-1” meetings with Government representatives to address any questions.  A final RFQ will be released on or about February 14, 2006, with offers due approximately three (3) weeks later.

Work includes: development of collection tasking, data management, and scientific analysis necessary to assess sensors and sensor system support for the detection, classification, and reporting of worldwide ballistic missile activity. 

A draft Statement of Work may be found at the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website, https://www.fedteds.gov, using the solicitation number “HQ0006-06-Q-0003”.  The draft Statement of Work will be uploaded to FedTeDS on Tuesday, January 10, 2006.  Businesses must register with the FedTeDS site in order to access this information.  Once the short-list is determined and the formal RFQ released, only firms on the short-list will have access to the FedTeDS HQ0006-06-Q-0003 site.

The resultant order will consist of a Firm-Fixed Price support services contract line item for labor and a Cost contract line item for Other Direct Costs (ODCs).  

The term of the order including options is anticipated to be at least three (3) years.  All positions will be on site within the National Capital Region.  In accordance with BRAC there is the potential for the location of the support requirements to be moved to other geographically dispersed locations.

All personnel require a TOP SECRET clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmental Information.  

Acceptable sources must hold a GSA Schedule, and be able to provide 100% of personnel with TOP SECRET clearances on task order start date which will be 30 calendar days after task order award date.  

GSA schedule contractors who qualify under NAICS 541710 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHYSICAL, ENGINEERING, AND LIFE SCIENCES are invited to submit to the contracting office as early as possible, but not later than January 20, 2006, a three-page Capability Statement summarizing the corporate strengths in relation to the following criteria:

<DESC>This is a Request for Information on 25 of the oldest backorders within the DSCC Maritime Supply Chain, as shown below. The purpose of this synopsis is to publish our oldest backorders, and vendors who can provide one or more of these items (in any quantity) are invited to respond to joseph.d.smith@dla.mil. Should a vendor respond with a quantity and price for one or more of these NSNs, the viability of a purchase for these items will then be considered, and the vendor will be contacted.

Because these items are meant to cover existing backorders, information provided by vendors will most likely only be considered in instances where the product can be provided in a very short period of time (optimally 30 days or less).

The preferred method of response to this Request for Information is email. A new set of items on backorder will be published monthly.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NOI60035

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is interested in identifying whether there any interested Small Business Concerns with the requisite capabilities to provide recruitment services to the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA.) The IRP NIDA is located on the campus of Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (JHBMC) in Baltimore, Maryland.  Using volunteer human participants, the IRP clinical program conducts multidisciplinary research involving residential and nonresidential clinical studies that interrelate with pre-clinical laboratory investigations.  In general, these studies evaluate the nature of drug abuse and addiction by assessing the abuse potential of drugs, investigating their underlying mechanisms and assessing treatment modalities for substance use disorders.

The majority of IRP research participants are adults between the ages of 18 and 50.  However, an increasing number of adolescent studies are being added to the clinical program.  Additional safeguards will be required when participating minors are recruited.  The number and type of participants to be recruited is dependent upon the research protocol.  

Although the IRP clinical protocols often require, by their very nature (i.e. studies employing addictive or potentially addictive drugs), that the research participant population be active drug abusers or users, clients of drug abuse treatment programs, or persons with a documented history of drug addiction or use, there are protocols conducted which require non-drug abusers or users.  For example, cigarette smokers and non-drug using controls would fill this category.  

All personnel working with human subjects are required to undergo necessary training and orientation regarding federal regulations, NIH regulations, and specific NIDA IRP clinical policies and procedures. 

The NIDA IRP Clinical Research Program’s research activities are guided by regulations from various federal government agencies to include, but not be limited to, FDA, NIH, and OHSR.  All personnel working for the NIDA IRP clinical program are required to undergo training in various areas including but not limited to confidentiality, ethics of clinical research, Human Research Privacy Act.  

The NIDA IRP maintains an electronic medical record system know as the Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW).  The Contractor will be granted access to this system, and will be expected to enter and compile participant documentation as required.

	The objectives of this contract are to provide the IRP with: 
1.	marketing, advertisement and liaison services with various communities to recruit participants for active residential and non-residential studies.
2.	telephone and in-person screening for eligibility into research protocols to include, but not limited to medical, psychological and drug use history.
3.	back-up technical support for research protocols, as dictated by the needs of the clinical program. 
4.	greeting, scheduling, and remuneration for study participants
5.	maintenance of various clinical and administrative databases for participant recruitment.
6.	generation of reports as needed for particular government usage
7.	 re-contact, follow up and aftercare when appropriate.

To be deemed capable to provide the above services, a Small Business Concern must submit a written capability statement (not to exceed 15 pages) that clearly demonstrates the ability to: provide multi-media marketing and advertising services, establish and maintain connections with community resources, and liaison with various and diverse communications and media groups.  The Contractor shall also be skilled in telephone and in-person screening of individuals to determine their acceptability as participants in clinical protocols.  In-person screening shall be performed in coordination with the NIDA medical screening staff (Physicians Assistants, Nurse Practitioners, Physicians and other clinical staff).

AT THIS TIME, THE NIDA SS/SA IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.    THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541990.   Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is $6.5 million.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/  for information on what is a small business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates number of employees.

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Susan A. Nsangou, Contracting Officer, at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on January 19, 2006.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns, the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside or partially set-aside for small businesses.

Years of data have been gathered using this specific technology with instrumentation requiring wet chemistry analyses to establish calibrations for NIR analysis.  Infrared reflectance profiles from the instrument are correlated with the results of wet chemistry analyses and a correlation equation is developed.  Calibration equations developed over thirteen years need to be used on the replacement analyzer or thirteen years of wet chemistry will have to be regenerated.  This analyzer provides the same reflectance as the analyzer being replaced.  *Provide Qualification Statement by Close of Business January 20, 2006, if interested in this procurement.

<SUBJECT>Acoustic Horns
<DESC>Purpose: The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) is interested in investigating  and quantifying the performance characteristics of directional acoustic hailing  devices that can be used to provide unambiguous warning(s) that, if ignored,  may demonstrate hostile intent of that approaching person, vehicle, or craft.   The JNLWD is sponsoring an evaluation of directional Acoustic Hailing Devices  (AHD) for both sea and land applications including acknowledgement capability  and military usefulness.  The US Navy (USN) and US Army (USA) are jointly  conducting the evaluation, which involves three phases to identify and compare  existing AHDs, then select candidates for further military assessments  including, but not limited to, convoy force protection, tactical checkpoints,  detainee operations, port security, and maritime force protection operations. Submission: The information papers must be submitted separately to the POCs listed by 1600  EST on January 24, 2006.  Again, the information papers are intended as a  market survey and a basis for the selection of Phase II AHD candidates.

<SUBJECT>--ARMY SYNCHRONIZATION TOOL
<DESC>The Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) intends to procure on a sole source basis with a small business company; ProModel Corporation, 556 East Technology Ave, OREM, UT 84097-8110, USA.  The services are for Technical Support beginning 20 Jan 06 through 19  Jan 11, to evolve the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) Synchronization Tool (AST) prototype into an official system of record.  ARFORGEN is a new force management process instituted by the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) to synchronize the manning, equip ping, training and resourcing functions inherent in generating Army units for worldwide use.  The ARFORGEN Synchronization Tool requirement has now become very critical and the timelines for the services are very stringent.  Further development of a new to ol that is not within the Armys inventory would delay in fulfilling FORSCOMs requirements.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide all the services that will satisfy its requirement, based on the responses provided to the S ynopsis for Sources Sought on FED BIZ OPPS Announcement dated 02 16 Dec 05, and other independent Market Research.

<DESC>The U.S. assistance program in Haiti supports U.S. economic, democracy, humanitarian and national security interests.  The United States has made its largest financial investment in the areas of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, food security, economic development, development and support of democratic institutions, and most recently, in the support of the Interim Government of Haiti (IGOH).  In addition to the normal development and humanitarian efforts, a large reconstruction program was begun in the fall of 2005 in response to the disastrous results of Tropical Storm Jeanne.  The normal strategic plan end date would have been 2004.  Due to the extraordinary situation in the country, the strategic plan end date has been extended to 2006.

<DESC>The U.S. assistance program in Haiti supports United States’ national security interests.  The development landscape is one of the most challenging in the world.   While other countries in the region with similar development profiles thirty-five years ago have achieved middle-income status, Haiti remains the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.  With a turbulent political history, frequent changes of governments, an extraordinarily high concentration of economic wealth, and a citizenry that lacks both confidence and trust in its public institutions, Haiti faces challenges that few nations of the 21st century know.  Consequently, the U.S. Government has made substantial financial investments for many years in the country’s development, particularly in the areas of economic growth, democratic institutions, health (including the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS), food security, disaster mitigation, and humanitarian assistance.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

The Water and Sanitation Advisor is an integral part of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) Health Team. OFDA addresses all disaster health risks with a strong focus on identifying and managing health risks in complex humanitarian emergencies (CHEs). In natural and complex emergencies, excess mortality results from malnutrition, malaria, measles, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections. HIV/AIDS is increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to excess mortality in disasters. These conditions disproportionately affect vulnerable groups (children under five years of age, the elderly, and women). The team provides technical assistance to OFDA including assessments, proposal reviews, risk management, capacity building and technical innovations to address the major causes of excess morbidity and mortality.  OFDA's water and sanitation interventions include rehabilitation and/or drilling of water sources, water catchment systems, funding for training on diarrheal disease prevention and treatment, sanitation intervention (latrines), hygiene promotion on water and sanitation issues. 

Introduction

OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) is within the DRM Division and was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response mechanism.  It is divided into a number of subgroups that include the Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.  The Water and Sanitation Advisor is part of the Health Team in TAG.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

12.)  Contractor Selection Criteria.  The Contractor will be selected by the government not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of the initial training delivery in order to allow adequate time for preparation of presentation materials and student handouts and to discuss details with the Course Director.  The contractor will be selected on the basis of:
	a. Best Value to the Government
	b. Contractor Qualifications and Experience in teaching this subject matter.
	c. Quality of Technical Materials provided.

13.)  Technical Review.  Prospective contractors will submit in conjunction with their bid price an advance copy of the student handbook and electronic information to be incorporated into the student (CD)as part of contract delivery.

6. Periodic Adjustments of Performance Standards:
In its experience with other performance-based instruments, DCMA has found it not only advisable but necessary to adjust performance standards periodically.  That is because particular written expressions of performance standards sometime inadvertently motivate services provider behaviors that act against achievement of the desired performance objectives.  Having learned that lesson, DCMA intends to apply it to this PWS.  Accordingly, DCMA reserves the right to adjust any or all performance standards in this PWS, up to and including the addition of entirely new performance standards and complete substitutions of new performance standards for those already existing in this PWS or as may have been included by subsequent modifications of this document, at any time at the DCMA Information Technology Customer Service Organization’s (ITCSO’s) discretion—subject, of course, to the stipulations in the “Changes” clause of any resulting contract.  DCMA, however, does not plan to make any such adjustments more often than once each calendar quarter and in fact would prefer not to make them any more frequently than once each calendar year.       
7.  Period of Performance:
The period of performance is 12 months from contract award.
8.  Security:  
SP personnel assigned to this effort will perform in an ADP III designated sensitive position due to the nature of the work performed.
Access to DCMA Information Technology (IT) unclassified systems/network is authorized.  In accordance with the DoD5200.2R, Personnel Security Program Regulation, contractor personnel performing services in Automated Data Processing (ADP) positions equivalent to the duties of duties equivalent to ADP-II or ADP-III positions shall be the subjects of a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check; however, for ADP II positions a NAC must be completed prior to performance on this contract. DCMA security personnel will validate proof of existing favorably adjudicated investigations. DCMA Security Office at 6350 Walker Lane, Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22310 will process new investigative requests.
When in DCMA-owned or controlled buildings or other facilities, SP personnel shall display DCMA-issued identification badges in accordance with the directions provided by this contract’s COTR.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Performance Work Statement (PWS):
Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)
Electronic Document Workflow (EDW) Web-based Training (WBT) 

1. Purpose of this PWS: 
The objective and scope of this effort is to provide a Web-based Training (WBT) package for the Electronic Document Workflow (EDW) 4.0 application for DCMA users.  DCMA users will take this training to become familiar with the changes provided by the new version of EDW.
2.  Background Information About DCMA:
DCMA is the Department of Defense agency responsible for working with the Defense industry to help ensure that systems, supplies, and services are delivered on time, at projected costs, and meet performance requirements.  This involves managing 320,000 prime contracts with current work valued at $850 billion.  
DCMA is headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia (with a mailing address of Alexandria, VA), and employs over 11,000 civilian and military professionals worldwide.   The agency is organized into three Districts: East, headquartered in Boston, MA; West, headquartered in Carson, CA; and International, which is co-located with the agency headquarters.  The districts are further subdivided into 60 Contract Management Offices (CMOs) that work with Defense industry SPs at over 900 locations worldwide.
3. EDW v4.0 Web-based Training (WBT)
The Service Provider (SP) shall provide software training on EDW v 4.0 to familiarize DCMA users with this version. The development of the WBT shall have four phases, outlined this section:
1.	Discovery
2.	Design
3.	Development
4.	Implementation/Revision
3.1 Discovery Phase
During a preliminary discovery phase, the SP shall recommend an overall training strategy. The SP will include the selection and organization of lesson topics, learning objectives, look and feel, and functionality, such as navigation.  All course content will be considered with and approved by DCMA prior to design.
The SP shall:
•	Meet with DCMA to formulate the training design concept and content for the project.  
•	Conduct analysis on the target audience, learning objectives, and required course content.  
•	Produce a Design Guide that will describe the WBT appearance, navigation method, course theme, and multimedia treatment.  
3.2 Design Phase
The SP shall develop storyboards from the design documentation in MS PowerPoint or MS Word format sufficient that users will be familiarized with EDW v 4.0.  

3.3 Development Phase
The SP shall develop and test the EDW v4.0 WBT product. The SP shall also develop an electronic set of quick reference procedures, called “Just-in-Time” training (JIT). The JIT shall be located within the EDW application. The SP shall design the JIT for users who have already completed the WBT, but need a topic refresher.
3.4 Implementation/Revision
The SP shall:
•	Deploy EDW v 4.0 training to DCMA users. 
•	Refine the web-based training course as required, based on official direction from this project’s COTR
