<DESC>The Contractor shall furnish all supervision, labor, equipment, supplies, and materials to furnish a cultural resource inventory report for 1650 acres of Class III, intensive, inventory of rugged public lands with small gently-graded mesatops bisected by deep arroyos.  Vegetation consists of dense old-growth pinyon-juniper woodland on the mesatops, brush-choked drainages and some open areas on the lower slopes covered with decadent sage.    Moderate to deep reddish-brown windblown loess deposits occur on the mesatops; and the eroded arroyos and slopes off the Mesa Verde are composed of water impermeable dark gray shales. The mesatop soils were fertile and well-drained and frequently utilized by prehistoric pueblo peoples for farming; and elevations and climate in this area are suitable for growing corn.  The steep western talus slopes of the Mesa Verde that form the eastern portion of the project area area highly erosive, with flash flooding a common occurrence in summer and fall, the water exiting the escarpment rapidly in the eastern portion of the survey area and slowing dramatically across the foothills in the western portion and into the upper reaches of McElmo Creek. None of these arroyos within the project area are named but they form much of the upper reaches of McElmo Creek.  It is these arroyos that appear to have been the focus of farming activity and the use of complex water-retention features prehistorically.  Unique, though not numerous, they appear to be very important architectural features incorporated into large communities and as such not represented with any frequency in the prehistoric record at yet.  Evidence of historic agricultural development in this area exists as well and may possess a high degree of integrity as public access to this area has been generally limited by adjacent private land and the lack of easy public access  .  This award is not expected to exceed $100,000.  The solicitation will be available by electronic posting only and may be found at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Bidders may print the bid documents to submit their bid by mail, or bids may be submitted electronically.  Facsimile bids will be accepted.  FAX:  303/239-3699.

<DESC>The Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) is a field activity of the Department of Defense and is comprised of several Directorates providing support to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  In the past, each Directorate has been responsible for its own Information Technology (IT) support and has done so through separate contracts each supporting a single Directorate.  In June 2004, a new WHS organization was formed, the Information Technology Management Directorate (ITMD). ITMD is charged with providing all IT support to WHS in a consolidated enterprise approach.  ITMD is responsible for delivering an efficient, performance-based IT environment with a prime support contractor who is fully accountable for integrating and delivering world-class services and performance.  ITMD is currently planning a competitive acquisition to select a prime contractor to provide this support.
ITMD released a Request for Information (RFI) to industry on October 19, 2005, and received inputs from interested offerors on November 16, 2005.  The RFI provided, in part, the following draft documents:  Statement of Objectives; Service Level Objectives; Work Breakdown Structure; and several documents describing the WHS IT environment.   These documents have now been updated and are attachments to this presolicitation notice. 
Based on the information collected in market research and upon further analysis by the Government acquisition team, WHS has determined that the forthcoming competitive acquisition will be for a single, winner-take-all contract with the winning prime contractor providing WHS information technology support under one consolidated effort.  Further, the Government currently anticipates conducting this acquisition as a small business set-aside under the procedures of FAR Subpart 19.5.    
Under the authority of FAR 15.202, Advisory Multi-Step Process, interested small business prime contractors (NAICS 51/54) are invited to submit information that will allow the Government an opportunity to advise them about their potential to be a viable competitor in the upcoming competitive acquisition.  To this end, small businesses are encouraged to form teaming arrangements, joint ventures or subcontracting agreements if necessary to increase their capability and viability to provide the required level of support.

A separate document will be posted to FBO providing interested offerors information necessary to respond to this Pre-solicitation Notice.

HSAR 3052.209–70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 
 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b) (1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend 
contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be 
suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling 
of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>DATABASE SUPPORT FOR THE CHORNOBYL THYROID STUDY IN UKRAINE.  The Radiology Epidemiology Branch (REB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute is seeking to award a follow-on contract to perform administrative and data entry activities with scientists from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kyiv, Ukraine in support of a long-term epidemiological study of thyroid cancer in the Ukraine.  The overall objective is to provide on-site processing of data forms generated during the screening procedures of up to 6,650 individuals per year.  Processing of questionnaires for study participants involves entering information from each of the following 13 forms: Control Form, Locator Form, Urine Collection Processing and Results Form, Blood Collection and Processing Form, Laboratory Blood Examination Results Form, 2 Thyroid Palpation Forms, Ultrasound Examination Form, Prior Medical History Form, Preliminary Endocrine Summary and Recommendation Form, Final Endocrine Summary and Recommendation Form, Dosimetry Questionnaire (Parent or Subject).  For some subjects, additional forms are filled out as applicable and include Cytology Procedure Form, Cytology Results Form, Pathology Form, Hospital Record Abstract Form, and others.  In addition, a small proportion of subjects require follow-up on a more frequent basis, which generates additional palpation, ultrasound, and laboratory forms.  This is estimated to correspond to more than 87,000 forms during a12-month performance period.  All data are collected in the Russian language and translated into English. 
	
In addition, data processing for the in utero sub-study component includes processing of forms for 1,500 exposed subjects and 1,000 control (not exposed) subjects.  During the screening, a set of 11 data forms ( based on the previous data processing experience, the Preliminary/Final Endocrine Summary form is completed for all subjects at two points during the examination cycle), and Medical History Amendment to the Dosimetric questionnaire will be completed for every sub-study participant.  This totals 27, 500 forms estimated to be completed during the initial screening.  In addition, approximately 5% of subjects will be referred for additional examination to clarify the diagnosis (125 visits).  It is estimated that the total number of forms to be processed for the in utero sub-study would be 28,875.

The Government intends to negotiate a one year contract with four option years with the University of Illinois with performance at their Ukraine office.  The statutory authority for this noncompetitive acquisition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This sole source renewal is based on the unique capabilities of the University of Illinois’ Ukraine office, English/Ukraine/Russian language skills, mastery of biomedical terminology, and interactive abilities in dosimetry, demography, epidemiology, clinical chemistry, ultrasound imagery, cytology, quality control, and screening operations. See numbered note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Award is anticipated by December 2006.   This is a renewal of contract N02-CP-21000 with University of Illinois.  To see a copy of the Request for Proposal or for questions, contact Sharon A. Miller at (301) 435-3783.

To provide an EHF communication link the SUBHDR EHF Communication Group (CG) requires interface to the submarine Navigation system. The Ships Navigation system provides 400 Hz Synchro signals consisting of Roll, Pitch, Heading, Speed, and Periscope Bearing to the SUBHDR EHF CG. The CG will use this information to produce and accurately maintain an EHF Antenna pointing solution required by the EHF Antenna system to acquire the satellite downlink and uplink signals when the submarine is in a dynamic or static platform condition.  One card will be required to bring in data in either synchro or digital signals, record and then send synchro or digital signals.  Seven cards are required to provide data in synchro or digital signals.  These seven cards do not record data input.  A written Request for Quote (RFQ) containing detailed specifications shall be released on or about 06/12/2006.  A Firm Fixed Price purchase order is anticipated.

The contractor shall also assess multiple indicators corals-algae-fishes.  At a minimum, the contractor’s assessment shall evaluate coral, algae and fish populations to establish health estimates of the coral reef system.  Scientifically recognized methodologies shall be used to collect, analyze and report this data.  The protocol that shall be used by the contractor to assess the coral reef system are: partial or total mortality of major reef building corals by species and size; relative abundance of principal algae types (i.e. macroalgae and crustose corallines); diversity of fishes and the abundance and sizes of key fish species.  The contractor shall provide a Technical Report which details the results of the data collection, analysis and interpretation of the data.  This report shall also include observations for a regional assessment of the health of the coral reefs in comparison to coral reef systems throughout the Caribbean.

<DESC>This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the May 2006 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-09.  This acquisition is NOT small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 813920.  

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) working as the coordinating office of the Partners in Information Access to the Public Health Workforce (Partners) to procure professional support services on a sole source basis from The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the national nonprofit organization representing the state and territorial public health agencies of the United States.  NLM plans to provide support to ASTHO to focus on two specific public health fields to determine a methodology for an enumeration that will work as a model for public health as a whole.  Various reports developed by leaders in public health have pointed out that the accurate, timely, and on-going enumeration of the public health workforce is critical in providing the necessary data for long-term planning and projections that would lead to successful recruitment, retention, training, succession planning, and funding strategies.  An enumeration is needed to determine the growing shortage within the public health community with relative certainty in the two fields.  The vendor will: 1) perform a literature search and analyze results on enumeration activities in the environmental health field and one additional public health field to be determined, including: the estimated size of each workforce field, number of professions within the specific field, and the impact of any past enumerations; 2) assemble and direct a Taskforce to guide efforts to enumerate the environmental health workforce and one additional public health field to be determined;  and 3) produce a report that will synthesize results from the literature search as well as the key questions and recommendations from the Taskforce.  The Taskforce will be comprised of organizational representatives from environmental health and one additional public health field to be determined.  ASTHO has long-standing established professional working relationships with many of the essential organizations needed to serve on this group.  Moreover, ASTHO has analyzed public health workforce data produced by numerous workforce projects including a 2003 survey of state health officials about public health worker shortage issues affecting state public health agencies and a 2005 workforce enumeration review.  One of the top four public health job categories identified to be effected by a workforce shortage was the environmental health practitioner.  The report will detail the next steps towards pursuing an enumeration of the environmental health workforce and the additional to be determined public health field, as well as cost options to the extent possible.  

NLM has identified ASTHO as having the requisite experience, knowledge and skills to perform this work.  ASTHO is uniquely qualified to provide the required services in the shortest possible timeframe and at least cost.  

This requirement is for a twelve (12) month period.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM.  The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.  Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html.  The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site: FAR 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions—Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Items) (February 2006).

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/ National Weather Service (NWS) intends to establish an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide technical evaluation and support services for life-cycle maintenance and catastrophic recovery of the radomes existing in the NEXRAD Program's weather radar network managed by the NWS's  Radar Operation Center.  The contract is anticipated to be awarded for a base period and four one-year options.  

General:  The WSR-88D Radar Operations Center (ROC) has support management responsibility for the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1998 Doppler (WSR-88D) radars for the tri-agency Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) program.  Part of the support management responsibility associated with these radars is the maintenance of the Radome structure in a fully operational condition to ensure the mission of the tri-agency radar network of 158 operational and 8 non-operational radars can be continuously met.  The WSR-88D Radome was designed and manufactured by L3 Communications-ESSCO.  The Radome configuration is Model S38-90, Part Number 8531-1, CAGE: 15175, and its associated subsystems whose design and engineering data is the proprietary property of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), L3 Communications-ESSCO.  Consistency in the radome configuration baseline is mandatory at all WSR-88D sites to sustain the quality of meteorological products generated as a result of the radar antenna sending and receiving signals at the specific frequency assigned to NEXRAD.  It is necessary to periodically inspect the soundness of the radome and lightning protection system conditions at various WSR-88D sites, which are located throughout the continental United States (CONUS) and outside CONUS, which are exposed to extreme environments or have experienced a catastrophic event. Some radomes are located at remote mountainous sites that are only accessible at certain times of the year.  Timeliness of inspection and subsequent repair are critical to restore the WSR-88D radome to its original operational condition.  WSR-88D radars must be 96% operationally available to meet the diverse meteorological missions of the NEXRAD tri-agency partners.  

The Government does not own data rights to the engineering and maintenance data associated with the WSR-88D Radome.  Consequently, the Government does not have permission to distribute engineering and maintenance data outside of the Government.  Additionally, the Government does not have the resources ( i.e.,  personnel, funding or facilities) to acquire, replenish and manage supplies and materials as Government Furnished Material.  

SPECIFIC:  This proposed IDIQ contract provides for the initial WSR-88D Radome inspection and engineering evaluation services.  Based on the results of these evaluation services, this contract provides for the WSR-88D Radome Installation and Repair Services for timely restoration of the inspected radome to its original condition, and WSR-88D radome Supplies and Materials required for restoration of the inspected radome to its original condition.  The work under this contract provides for the delivery of WSR-88D Radome Engineering Data and Engineering Change Proposals resulting from the inspection and engineering evaluation services in the event the current WSR-88D radome data and configuration identification cannot continue to support the requirements of the WSR-88D radar as it evolves in its life cycle.  Finally, the work statement requires the Contractor to store Government Property at the Contractor's facility.

As a condition for award, offerors shall include in their proposal a letter from the OEM (L3 Communications-ESSCO) stating that the OEM will sell the required panels to the offeror, together with the proper statement concerning OEM permission to use the proper manuals and the engineering and maintenance data associated with the WSR-88D Radome, Model S38-90, Part Number 8531-1, CAGE 15175.  All supplies and materials must be in new condition and meet the OEM specifications.   

This acquisition is expected to be awarded under NAICS Code 811219, size standard of $56.5 million on the basis of full and open competition.   The estimated date for release of this solicitation is on or about June 12, 2006, with a planned closing date of July 12, 2006.  Questions regarding this procurement may be directed to Susan Labovitz, Contract Specialist at: Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov or (303)497-7943.    Parties interested in this solicitation should utilize the FedBizOpps features to register to receive notification and register as an interested vendor.    Parties registered to receive notification will be notified by FBO via email of the documents availability.     

Mandatory Clause:     As of October 1, 2003, the Mountain Region Acquisition Division requires that all contractors doing business with this acquisition office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).   After this date, NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.     For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site:     http:///www.ccr.gov/.     In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number.     A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.  See Note 26.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Roberto Juan Moya Clemente, Financiera Rural, Agrarismo 227, 6 Piso, Col. Escandón, C.P. 11800, Deleg. Miguel Hidalgo, México, D.F., Phone: (011-5255) 5230-1633; Fax: (011-5255) 5230-1644     The Grantee, Financiera Rural (FR), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for the Agricultural and Rural Bank Officer Training Program.

Established in 2002, FR was originally capitalized by the Mexican government with $1.7 billion to act as a wholesale or “second story” bank lender to financial institutions which serve rural areas.  However, with wholesale lending proving slow to get off the ground, FR started to lend directly to agricultural and rural sectors. With this expanded corporate mission came the need for greater technical skill among FR staff.  Although FR is officially allowed to provide training to its intermediary, agricultural and rural customers, no money can be expended for internal training purposes. Given this lack of authority, FR requested that the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) fund technical assistance which would enable FR to conduct a training program to deepen its professional in-house expertise in risk assessment, project finance and management, credit analysis and loan evaluation.   

The Agricultural and Rural Bank Officer Training Project would enable FR to develop a thoroughly professional bank officer training and certification program in a manner that allows long term continuation of the program based upon the training modules and digital materials produced. The objective of this technical assistance is to expand and improve the quality of FR’s rural financial institution training programs. The Project would have three components:  (1) basic entry-level bank loan and credit officer training; (2) advanced specialized training on particular subjects relating to each officer’s work within FR; and (3) a certification program. 

The requisite professional quality of this Project requires a team of individuals highly skilled in agricultural and rural finance, as well as technicians with computer and video skills who are capable of producing this financial resource. 

The Project is designed to include content development, live classroom training, and digital taping and storage to enable FR to meet its comprehensive training needs for the near future.  The program is designed to leave FR with digital media formats of all programs and modules of taped classroom presentations to enable delivery to many subsequent FR training classes over a long-term basis. These training programs could be periodically or annually updated as conditions, practices, and markets evolve. The final component of the Project would be the development of a bank certification program which would help FR to be rigorous and exacting on its trainees.  The training certificate would ultimately be valued by FR management as a fundamental requirement for job promotion, a prerequisite for loan and credit officer and superior management positions, and a component for assessing employee compensation. 

The Terms of Reference (TOR) are included in Annex 5 in greater detail but include the following: (1) Develop FR Basic Boot Camp Bank Officer Training Program, (2) Conduct and Record Basic Training Program, (3) Develop Advanced Specialization Training Modules, (4) Conduct and Record Advanced Training Modules, (5) Develop a FR Bank Officer Training Certification Program, (6) Development Impact of the Training Program, (7) Prepare Final Report.

Implementation of this Project would enable FR to develop a thoroughly professional rural bank and credit officer training program that ensures FR staff has achieved the same level of basic bank loan and credit officer training. The Project will help FR develop the in-house expertise that matches the expanding demands of FR’s mission.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $847,109 dollar grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit one version of their Proposal in English with one (1) copy and one version of their Proposal in Spanish and six (6) copies directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM LOCAL TIME, June 30, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to modify Contract No. SS00-05-60084, Evaluate Youth Demonstration Project (YTD).  The modification would require the contractor, Mathematica Policy Research (MPR), to provide additional technical assistance (TA) to new and existing sites in the YTD demonstration project.  MPR has already begun providing TA to project sites as part of their contract.  The modification will further develop this work through some additional TA activities.  Award of this requirement for the expansion of TA activities is critical to enable the enrollment of demonstration participants in the existing and new YTD sites, which is ongoing for the existing sites, and will commence in 2007 for the new sites.  SSA has determined that MPR has extensive knowledge of the demonstration project requirements and is therefore uniquely qualified to perform the additional work required by this modification.  

BACKGROUND:  On September 30, 2005 SSA awarded a 9-year contract to MPR to conduct full implementation/process evaluations with each YTD project site involved in the YTD project, and based upon the development of each project site, move forward with a random assignment design at specified locations, in order to determine the impacts of each program. The research for this study will include impact evaluations in approximately 6 project sites (with additional project sites participating in the implementation portion of the study). The existing YTD Cooperative agreements will all participate, with SSA seeking to increase the number of project sites available through this contract mechanism.  MPR will work with SSA to add between 2 - 4 additional project sites with an understanding that these new project sites will implement a random assignment design.  All project sites will take part in the process/implementation evaluation.  Those project sites which are demonstrated to meet standards for a random assignment evaluation will take part in this portion of the evaluation as well. 

REQUIREMENTS:    MPR shall provide continuous programmatic TA to the existing 7 cooperative agreement project sites and the 2 – 4 additional project sites management and staff based on individual project sites needs.  MPR shall also provide TA tailored to each site in the design/development and implementation of interventions.  The TA will ensure that the treatment groups are appropriately differentiated from the control groups in the random assignment sites, as well as provide strong interventions in all sites regardless of evaluation design.  MPR shall closely monitor the progress of the development and implementation of changes in the interventions at each project site in order to provide feedback and recommendations for corrective action, where needed.  MPR shall develop and implement Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) Management Information Systems (MIS) for all new sites.  For existing sites, MPR shall work to maintain appropriate MIS, including but not limited to ETO.  These MIS shall track a core set of outcomes, and be useful for both programmatic and evaluation purposes.  These TA services are required by September 30, 2006.  MPR shall provide maintenance to MIS as appropriate.  Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services should submit a capability statement to Donyale DeShazo via email at donyale.deshazo@ssa.gov.  Responses shall be marked Evaluate Youth Demonstration Project (YTD), CAPABILITY STATEMENT, and shall be received no later than June 12, 2006, 3:00PM EST.  All responsible sources will be considered.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date, a modification will be issued directly to the MPR contract referenced above.  All questions must be submitted in writing to Donyale DeShazo via the email address listed above.  Telephone calls will NOT be accepted. Reference Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>DATES:  White papers will be accepted on a continuous basis until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Dec 2008.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details. I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:  AFRL/IF has asserted its leadership role and developed and transitioned products in Information Assurance R&D for a number of years.  Most recently, AFRL/IF has expanded this role to address all aspects of Network Combat Operations or Cyber Operations.  This BAA is a contracting tool directly responsive to an AFRL/IF Strategic Plan in the technical area of Cyber Operations. The technologies being pursued will provide greater functions and capabilities within the Information Warfare domain and push not only Air Force and DoD needs, but also those of National Security, Homeland Defense and Critical Infrastructure Protection. The technologies endorsed will take into full account the Air Force's move toward transformation. The technology research in the BAA will be focused in the following areas: Covert Cyber Operations;  Threat Evaluation, Attack Recognition and Diagnosis; Assured Infostructure Support; Wireless Information Assurance; Complex Systems.  II. General Information: The Government may, at its sole discretion, require that research results be documented in a paper suitable for publication in a national and/or international peer-reviewed journal or professional journal. III. Background: The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate's (AFRL/IF) has developed a responsive Information Warfare Research and Development (R&D) technology program. The objective is to meet the needs of the Air Force's Information Operations doctrine. Specifically, it is focused on Cyber Operations which includes: Information Assurance, Computer Network Defense, Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, and Computer Network Attack.   Information Assurance (IA) comprises those measures to protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authenticity, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.  Computer Network Defense is actions taken to plan and direct responses to unauthorized activity in defense of Air Force information systems and computer networks. Commanders should provide CND planning guidance to the staff, as well as supporting and subordinate commanders, as part of the "commander's intent." CND actions include analyzing network activity to determine the appropriate course of action (COA) to defend Air Force networks. Computer Network Attack operations are conducted using information systems to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves. Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) are functions in cyberspace that result in the ability to gather information about the adversary, their intentions, and their capabilities.  IV. Objectives: The objective of this BAA is to address highly innovative R&D areas in Cyber Operations.  Proposed work should address the innovation and strategic thought of the 21st century adversary, and develop new concepts to counter with innovative information-based capabilities. Further, proposed work  should address new concepts for  continuously analyzing the information battlespace to identify US vulnerabilities and adversary weaknesses, and develop new defensive  and offensive strategies and capabilities accordingly. V. Research Areas: The following section describes several critical technical areas that are a focus under this BAA to receive attention. These areas are high leverage areas that must be worked in order to address the most difficult Air Force requirements, provide the Air Force with the greatest technology push possible, and surface opportunities for contributing to important national security issues such as defending information systems and countering cyber terrorism.  A.  Covert Cyber Operations.  The area of Covert Cyber Operations holds tremendous potential as a major future thrust for AFRL/IF. It is an area that can be described as allowing us access to the cyberspace domain for the purpose of adversary monitoring, intelligence gathering or information-based attack. In order to make the Covert Cyber Operations area a fully functional Air Force capability we must develop effects-based tools that allow us to plan for and achieve the desired effects of a planned cyber operation. For example, deploying effects-based tools that give decision makers lines of reasoning and their respective scenario implications would be valuable addition to the Cyber Operations and conventional warfare arsenal. This gives the decision maker a comprehensive "information set" that presents only useful information and disallows noise. Work is needed in the areas of Cyber ISR and Computer Network Attack (CNA). Cyber ISR entails developing technology for gathering information about the adversary, their intentions, and their capabilities and is necessary for identification and targeting of the adversary in cyberspace. CNA tools and systems that must be developed to penetrate an adversary's detection system and remain hidden until triggered. Cyber Operations interest areas include access, targeting, mission planning, attack effectiveness measures, attack damage assessment, and CNA tool development. B. Threat Evaluation, Attack Recognition and Diagnosis. The threat evaluation, attack recognition and diagnosis area is one that will be of critical importance in the future for not only the Air Force, but also DoD and U.S. critical infrastructures. As discussed above, the Air Force and DoD are building information systems and networks and offering "information services that rely on more complex and larger-scale information networks each year (and more recently, wireless and high speed). It is apparent that it is extremely difficult if not impossible to prevent all attacks against such systems. The ability to recognize attacks, evaluate the threat and diagnose the salient aspects of such attacks becomes a critical issue. New R&D is needed to address aspects of early warning. Early recognition of an adversary information warfare attack means that we must have technology in place that can look across both time and space looking for events that may seem insignificant in isolation but taken together could be laying the foundation for a large-scale attack, such as distributed denial of service. In addition to improving intrusion detection capabilities, tools need to be developed that address correlation and fusion of cyberspace attack indicators. Work also needs to continue in the area of cyberspace visualization and situation awareness to better assist the overloaded operator in attack recognition and diagnosis. Another area of critical importance is cyber forensics and attack assessment. Computer forensics is an area most commonly associated with law enforcement. The R&D proposed in this BAA addresses the gathering of digital evidence for the purpose of "just-in-time" attack assessment in a complex network environment. The need to gather digital evidence in the military information environment is critical as the commander needs accurate, verifiable evidence of who is attacking, what techniques they are using, and where the attacker is located. In addition, accurate digital evidence drives the response whether it is defensive or offensive. Finally, an area of particular importance in the area of threat evaluation, attack recognition and diagnosis concerns the insider threat. The insider threat is one of the most insidious threats facing the implementation and full realization of Network-Centric Warfare technologies. First, a lack of fine-grained security controls on the inside may mean that a malicious insider could gain access to information above their classification level or not within their need-to-know profile. Adding to this, a lack of sufficiently fine-grained auditing tools would make it difficult if not impossible to accurately determine if someone or a group of collaborators are violating the information assurance policy.  C. Assured Infostructure Support. The Air Force is an information intensive organization that relies upon a complex, interconnected collection of networks and information systems to carry out its mission. These networks and information systems must have a strong defense against the myriad of threats that we face today and will increase in capability in the future. Since greater attention is being given to resolve operational stovepipes and the need for better systems integration, multi-level security (MLS) and secure mobile code continue to be critical technical areas. Technology is also needed to integrate and reason about both network management and intrusion detection data. Related to the fault tolerance concept and drawing from that discipline is the area of intrusion tolerance. Intrusion tolerance is emerging as one of the most important R&D areas in Cyber Operations today since the systems and networks we depend upon must continue to operate through intrusions and keep operating, albeit in a degraded mode, in spite of a successful adversary information warfare attack.  D. Wireless Information Assurance.  A key piece of the large-scale information enterprise is the wireless information assurance segment. Wireless networks must exhibit the same functional and IA attributes as wired networks. They must be protected, attacks against these networks must be detected, specifics of successful attacks must be assessed and finally appropriate responses must be carried out. As we move to more and more wireless components becoming a part of the larger network and as wireless networks proliferate we need to be aware that these networks, if improperly understood and configured, could provide a "back-door" into our protected wired enterprise. Intrusion detection for wireless networks must be addressed as well as recovery of wireless services after adversary disruption/denial destruction of friendly networks. Software Defined Radio (SDR) and distributed boundary control technology is needed to allow flexibility in operations and enhanced assured operations.  E. Complex Systems. New techniques are needed to that help system engineers to state and reason about the complex relationships of all of the IA products within an organizations information enterprise. An improperly utilized tool, technique or product could invalidate the IA posture of a whole organization. Metrics are needed and an obvious place to start when developing IA metrics is to examine the properties of confidentiality, availability and integrity. A focus for future designs is Biologically Inspired Cyber Operations area. It is an area that holds promise for protection of the enterprise, detection of attacks, response to successful attacks, and even carrying out computer network attacks against an adversary. With the increase of size, interconnectivity, and number of points of access, computer networks have become vulnerable to various forms of information attacks, especially to new sophisticated ones. Biological organisms are also complex and interconnected systems that have many points of access and are vulnerable to sabotage by alien microorganisms. In fact, biological organisms have developed a very successful immune system for detecting, identifying, and destroying most alien intruders.  II.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service(NWS) Acquisition and Grants Office intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis with Continuent, 560 S. Winchester Blvd, San Jose, CA 95128 to provide a custom MySQL software solution for the standardization and consolidation of Web Services for the NWS.  

The NWS is in the process of an IT Consolidation effort to migrate to “standardized” webfarm structures in order to reduce maintenance costs, reduce communications costs, increase product availability, and simplify development efforts.  

This requirement involving “mission critical” services to supply weather warning data to the public requires highly reliable database clustering software that will: 1. provide real-time data synchronization between cluster member servers and uniform display of synchronized data; 2. provide a single common IP, allowing the whole cluster to appear as one logical server; 3. provide fast, automatic and transparent failover between nodes for handling queries; 4. provide load balancing between servers; 5. provide the ability to allow the shutdown of any member server for maintenance, without service interruption or extensive reconfiguration; 6. provide simple scalability to increase or decrease cluster nodes; 7. use existing common hardware and operations systems (Redhat Linux); 8. not require rewriting of existing software that access existing MySQL databases; 9. provide unlimited site licenses for unlimited use of the software by NOAA.

Continuent currently provides MySQL cluster EAC software to the NWS Central Region.  Additional custom middleware will provide consistency in, and expand the solution to, consolidated NWS Web farms, as well as leverage existing investments in personnel training.

Contractors who believe they can satisfy the Government’s requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to provide a software solution satisfying all the previously  cited requirements.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Affirmative responses must be received by Dena Gilmour via e-mail at Dena.M.Gilmour@noaa.gov no later than C.O.B., June 9, 2006, Eastern Daylight Savings Time.  Award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Minerals Management Service is replacing the previous announcement of the same number posted on May 24, 2006 in its entirety and changing it's title to  Broad Agency Announcement:  MMS Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER) DESCRIPTION: The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR (DOI), MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length for specific topics of interest to the MMS Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER). For your information, the MMS web site has descriptions of OSER activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects. The web site address is: http://www.mms.gov/tarphome/index.htm.  BACKGROUND:  Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee the orderly development of offshore oil and gas operations. New challenges and informational needs arise as companies use new equipment or procedures based on technological changes or as operations expand into new or different environments such as the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).   The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2007 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of approximately $ 1,000,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSER topics in FY 2007 with projects being identified through this announcement. NOTICE: MMS may share the white papers with other government agencies for review. Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the Papers/proposals shared.  OBJECTIVES:  The topics for the FY 2007 OSER activities include ONLY research on the following: 1. Provide best practices guideline and assess well completion options and methodologies for high pressure/high temperature/ and sour (H2S) wells. 2. Evaluate the fatigue life of risers and floating structures and review the fatigue modeling process and begin to write a replacement standard. 3. Initiate a joint industry project to develop and test an on-line integrity monitoring system for offshore platform structures.  The system would minimize dive inspections, improve safety, and assist in returning a platform back to production quicker. This joint industry project could be tested by monitoring 10 - 20 platforms for 3 - 5 years. 4.  Conduct a technology assessment for Outer Continental Shelf, Oil and Gas Operations in the Cold Regions to determine what may be technically feasible -- given both ice-challenges, and also open water with large fetches and waves. 5.  Evaluate superstructure icing of the both drilling and production vessels and platforms as it relates to conducting activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. 6.  Assess the design options for pipelines and provide a risk analysis for strudel scour, upheaval buckling and ice gouging in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. 7. Assess methods for using a sub sea instrumentation cable to evaluate technology for use in the Arctic.

A typical series will include  such record types as photographic prints and negatives, slides, engineering drawings, maps, various oversize materials, and/or other nontextual records. The series concerned in the initial phase of the contract are photographs created by the US Forest Service between the early 1900’s and 1964, and processed under Record Group 095.  These photographs document Pacific Southwest Region National Forest and Research/Experiment Station work. Such records currently get medium to high use.  The series records are generally arranged according to the National Forest or type of work done, and by accession, and thereunder numerically or chronologically. During processing, a finding aid documenting nontextual preservation work performed and the resulting sequence of the records will be created. 

Within the containers, the photographs are stored in varying conditions, mostly mounted on paper cards containing valuable descriptive information, with accompanying envelopes for duplicates. The photographs are often accompanied by negatives, and in some cases paper and glass slides are also included.  The items are mostly 5”x8”. (i.e. 3.5” x 5.5” photos mounted on 5” x 8” envelopes)

Records for the initial period consist of approximately 30 cubic feet of photographs stored in acidic FRC boxes.  There are approximately 12,500 original photographs and images plus duplicates. 

Records to be preserved for the option periods of the contract may also include various types of non-textual records, such as engineering drawings, in other Record Groups and originated by other Federal agencies such as RG 77, the Army Corps of Engineers.

The Contractor must provide all management, supervision, and personnel necessary to perform archival preservation of photographic holdings. The contract awarded as a result of this RFQ will be a Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Time and Materials  contract with Department of Labor wage determinations incorporated , as necessary. The term of the contract will be from day of award to end of  FY2006 (September 30, 2006). All work for the initial project must be completed on a schedule mutually agreed upon by the vendor and the Government no later than December 31, 2006.

The requirement is a 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) code is 519120 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6 million. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by NARA. Copies of the RFQ, may be obtained through the Federal Business Opportunities web site at www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the Offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of solicitation and amendments, if any.

TITLE: Cyber Defensive & Offensive Operations Technology (CDOT)

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 03-18-IFKA

CFDA Number: n/a 

DATES:   White papers will be accepted on a continuous basis until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Dec 2008.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL/IF has asserted its leadership role and developed and transitioned products in Information Assurance R&D for a number of years.  Most recently, AFRL/IF has expanded this role to address all aspects of Network Combat Operations or Cyber Operations.  This BAA is a contracting tool directly responsive to an AFRL/IF Strategic Plan in the technical area of Cyber Operations. The technologies being pursued will provide greater functions and capabilities within the Information Warfare domain and push not only Air Force and DoD needs, but also those of National Security, Homeland Defense and Critical Infrastructure Protection. The technologies endorsed will take into full account the Air Force's move toward transformation. The technology research in the BAA will be focused in the following areas:  Covert Cyber Operations;  Threat Evaluation, Attack Recognition and Diagnosis;
Assured Infostructure Support; Wireless Information Assurance; Complex Systems.

II. General Information: The Government may, at its sole discretion, require that research results be documented in a paper suitable for publication in a national and/or international peer-reviewed journal or professional journal. 

III. Background: The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate's (AFRL/IF) has developed a responsive Information Warfare Research and Development (R&D) technology program. The objective is to meet the needs of the Air Force's Information Operations doctrine. Specifically, it is focused on Cyber Operations which includes: Information Assurance, Computer Network Defense, Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, and Computer Network Attack 

---- Information Assurance (IA) comprises those measures to protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authenticity, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

---- Computer Network Defense is actions taken to plan and direct responses to unauthorized activity in defense of Air Force information systems and computer networks. Commanders should provide CND planning guidance to the staff, as well as supporting and subordinate commanders, as part of the "commander's intent." CND actions include analyzing network activity to determine the appropriate course of action (COA) to defend Air Force networks.

---- Computer Network Attack operations are conducted using information systems to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.
---- Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) are functions in cyberspace that result in the ability to gather information about the adversary, their intentions, and their capabilities.

IV. Objectives: The objective of this BAA is to address highly innovative R&D areas in Cyber Operations.  Proposed work should address the innovation and strategic thought of the 21st century adversary, and develop new concepts to counter with innovative information-based capabilities. Further, proposed work  should address new concepts for  continuously analyzing the information battlespace to identify US vulnerabilities and adversary weaknesses, and develop new defensive  and offensive strategies and capabilities accordingly. 

V. Research Areas: The following section describes several critical technical areas that are a focus under this BAA to receive attention. These areas are high leverage areas that must be worked in order to address the most difficult Air Force requirements, provide the Air Force with the greatest technology push possible, and surface opportunities for contributing to important national security issues such as defending information systems and countering cyber terrorism.

A.  Covert Cyber Operations.

The area of Covert Cyber Operations holds tremendous potential as a major future thrust for AFRL/IF. It is an area that can be described as allowing us access to the cyberspace domain for the purpose of adversary monitoring, intelligence gathering or information-based attack. In order to make the Covert Cyber Operations area a fully functional Air Force capability we must develop effects-based tools that allow us to plan for and achieve the desired effects of a planned cyber operation. For example, deploying effects-based tools that give decision makers lines of reasoning and their respective scenario implications would be valuable addition to the Cyber Operations and conventional warfare arsenal. This gives the decision maker a comprehensive "information set" that presents only useful information and disallows noise. Work is needed in the areas of Cyber ISR and Computer Network Attack (CNA). Cyber ISR entails developing technology for gathering information about the adversary, their intentions, and their capabilities and is necessary for identification and targeting of the adversary in cyberspace. CNA tools and systems that must be developed to penetrate an adversary's detection system and remain hidden until triggered. Cyber Operations interest areas include access, targeting, mission planning, attack effectiveness measures, attack damage assessment, and CNA tool development. 

B. Threat Evaluation, Attack Recognition and Diagnosis.

The threat evaluation, attack recognition and diagnosis area is one that will be of critical importance in the future for not only the Air Force, but also DoD and U.S. critical infrastructures. As discussed above, the Air Force and DoD are building information systems and networks and offering "information services that rely on more complex and larger-scale information networks each year (and more recently, wireless and high speed). It is apparent that it is extremely difficult if not impossible to prevent all attacks against such systems. The ability to recognize attacks, evaluate the threat and diagnose the salient aspects of such attacks becomes a critical issue. New R&D is needed to address aspects of early warning. Early recognition of an adversary information warfare attack means that we must have technology in place that can look across both time and space looking for events that may seem insignificant in isolation but taken together could be laying the foundation for a large-scale attack, such as distributed denial of service. In addition to improving intrusion detection capabilities, tools need to be developed that address correlation and fusion of cyberspace attack indicators. Work also needs to continue in the area of cyberspace visualization and situation awareness to better assist the overloaded operator in attack recognition and diagnosis. Another area of critical importance is cyber forensics and attack assessment. Computer forensics is an area most commonly associated with law enforcement. The R&D proposed in this BAA addresses the gathering of digital evidence for the purpose of "just-in-time" attack assessment in a complex network environment. The need to gather digital evidence in the military information environment is critical as the commander needs accurate, verifiable evidence of who is attacking, what techniques they are using, and where the attacker is located. In addition, accurate digital evidence drives the response whether it is defensive or offensive. Finally, an area of particular importance in the area of threat evaluation, attack recognition and diagnosis concerns the insider threat. The insider threat is one of the most insidious threats facing the implementation and full realization of Network-Centric Warfare technologies. First, a lack of fine-grained security controls on the inside may mean that a malicious insider could gain access to information above their classification level or not within their need-to-know profile. Adding to this, a lack of sufficiently fine-grained auditing tools would make it difficult if not impossible to accurately determine if someone or a group of collaborators are violating the information assurance policy. 

C. Assured Infostructure Support.  The Air Force is an information intensive organization that relies upon a complex, interconnected collection of networks and information systems to carry out its mission. These networks and information systems must have a strong defense against the myriad of threats that we face today and will increase in capability in the future. Since greater attention is being given to resolve operational stovepipes and the need for better systems integration, multi-level security (MLS) and secure mobile code continue to be critical technical areas. Technology is also needed to integrate and reason about both network management and intrusion detection data. Related to the fault tolerance concept and drawing from that discipline is the area of intrusion tolerance. Intrusion tolerance is emerging as one of the most important R&D areas in Cyber Operations today since the systems and networks we depend upon must continue to operate through intrusions and keep operating, albeit in a degraded mode, in spite of a successful adversary information warfare attack. 

D. Wireless Information Assurance.  A key piece of the large-scale information enterprise is the wireless information assurance segment. Wireless networks must exhibit the same functional and IA attributes as wired networks. They must be protected, attacks against these networks must be detected, specifics of successful attacks must be assessed and finally appropriate responses must be carried out. As we move to more and more wireless components becoming a part of the larger network and as wireless networks proliferate we need to be aware that these networks, if improperly understood and configured, could provide a "back-door" into our protected wired enterprise. Intrusion detection for wireless networks must be addressed as well as recovery of wireless services after adversary disruption/denial destruction of friendly networks. Software Defined Radio (SDR) and distributed boundary control technology is needed to allow flexibility in operations and enhanced assured operations.

E. Complex Systems.  New techniques are needed to that help system engineers to state and reason about the complex relationships of all of the IA products within an organizations information enterprise. An improperly utilized tool, technique or product could invalidate the IA posture of a whole organization. Metrics are needed and an obvious place to start when developing IA metrics is to examine the properties of confidentiality, availability and integrity. A focus for future designs is Biologically Inspired Cyber Operations area. It is an area that holds promise for protection of the enterprise, detection of attacks, response to successful attacks, and even carrying out computer network attacks against an adversary. With the increase of size, interconnectivity, and number of points of access, computer networks have become vulnerable to various forms of information attacks, especially to new sophisticated ones. Biological organisms are also complex and interconnected systems that have many points of access and are vulnerable to sabotage by alien microorganisms. In fact, biological organisms have developed a very successful immune system for detecting, identifying, and destroying most alien intruders.

<DESC>The following are responses to questions received:

Question # 1: 

NIST is requesting approximately 24,000 ml from approximately 100 donors.  From our experience 24,000 ml will require at least 135 donors.  Furthermore, not all donors can be relied upon to give a full unit of blood. Is a larger number of donors acceptable and will less than 200 ml plasma per individual donor be allowed (that is will short draws be allowed)?

Answer # 1:

Yes to both questions - more donors providing less than 200 mL/donor are okay as long as the demographic requirements are met.

Question # 2: 

Is the glucose oxidase test requested to ascertain glucose levels with the assumption that a fasting normal donor will exhibit between 77 and 100 mg/dL glucose?  It should be pointed out that this will not exclude a donor that had not fasted for 8-10 hours as a normal donor could return to this glucose level within 3-4 hours of breaking their fast.  Would it not be better to just require that the donors exhibit glucose between 77 and 100 mg/dL?

Answer # 2:

The glucose 85-110 is acceptable for normal range.  The low end can go down to 70.  There is controversy for FPG between 100-110 being normal; however, as long as the total population average is below 100 and no individual is above 110 we should have a normal enough sample.
 
While this does not necessary mean they were fasted, it will exclude diabetics and many pre-diabetics who would have greatly altered metabolism.

Question # 3:

Would it not be more cost effective to simply pool donors that are non-diabetic and meet the other health requirements and ignore age, sex, race and ethnicity?

Given this cost, and the questionable value of these restrictions, would the NIST consider dropping the age, sex, ethnic and racial requirements?

Answer # 3:

These are restrictions imposed by NIH, and NIST is not at liberty to drop them.

Questions # 4:

Are vegetarians considered to be practicing extreme dietary regimens?

Answer # 4:

Yes.

Question # 5:

The paragraph describing the elimination of units containing RBCs is very confusing.  If RBCs are observed, why not simply re-centrifuge?  Is the purpose here to eliminate hemolyzed units?  If so, why not so state and give a maximum hemoglobin requirement?

Answer # 5:

Yes, hemolyzed units are to be excluded, but this exclusion can be done by visual inspection as stated.

Question # 6:

The paragraph requiring the determination of plasticizers is similarly confusing and actually much too broad.  In the first place, there are no blood drawing apparatuses in the market currently that will not contain soft plastic products (at least not to our knowledge) which means that all such materials (draw tubes, blood bags, etc.) will contain plasticizers and therefore all such commercially available materials will leach plasticizers into the blood and any products derived from the blood such as serum or plasma.  Furthermore, there are literally dozens if not hundreds of plasticizers in use commercially.  We would need to know a) what plasticizers does the NIST want screened and b) what level will they accept for each of these plasticizers?  

Answer # 6:

The determination requirement is hereby omitted from the statement of work in section 6.3- Specific Requirement. The contractor shall provide NIST with 20 sets of equipment that contacted the plasma during processing (tubes, bags, etc.) so that qualified investigators can determine whether plasticizers and other contaminants provide a response on their own analytical platforms.

Question # 7:

“Unavoidable, known contaminants must be documented to avoid misinterpretation of metabolites.”  This statement is much too broad.  What unavoidable known contaminants are being referred to here?  Since we are not given a list of the metabolites, we have no idea what contaminants are being referred to.  We would need a specific list of these “known” contaminants?

Answer # 7:

Reference answer # 6 for the answer to question # 7.


Question # 8:

The method requested for filling the vials—that is numbered with the vials being sequentially filled in a Z pattern from 1-20,000 (with an additional 2000 plastic tubes) is much too slow.  For example if there is a 3 second minimum time per specimen (which is probably too fast) it will take 20 hours to fill all of the specimens.  We would strongly recommend that at least 2 and possible 3 separate filling devices be placed into the single 24 liter pooled plasma container and three sets of numbered vials be filled simultaneously which will reduce the filling time to under 8 hours.

Answer # 8:

The suggestion of 2 or 3 filling devices is acceptable as long as boxes are labeled to distinguish among the 3 devices – e.g., label boxes from the devices as A,B,C, with each also labeled for fill order:  1A, 2A, 3A, etc.

Questions # 9:

The plastic vials requested in addition to the samples in the glass vials are requested at the end of the fill.  Is this correct?  Would it not be more appropriate to sample these within the sampling run?

Answer # 9:

The requirement is for one single plastic bottle containing 2 L of the same plasma that was provided in the 20,000 individual glass vials.

Question # 10:

Given the age, racial, sex and ethnic restrictions (as well as several health related restrictions) the 105 days requested for completion of this project is unrealistic.  Can the project be given at least 6 months to complete if these requirements are insisted upon?



Answer # 10:

The total period of performance shall remain 105 days after receipt of order.

Question # 11:

When you ask for Asian American plasma, what exactly are you asking for?  What countries do these donors originated from?  What countries do you consider Asian?  The Asian culture makes it difficult to obtain units of blood.

Answer # 11:

Census data, from which our demographic requirements were drawn, rely on self-identification.  "Asian" could include:  Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Cyprus, East Timor, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Russia*, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Yemen. 

Note: Russia and Turkey are located in both Asia and Europe.

Question # 12:

Alaskan donor- Is this  a "Must have" or can something else be substituted?

Answer # 12:

American Indian can be substituted for the Alaskan

<CONTACT>Eric Holder, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3959
<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to answer questions that have been submitted regarding the above-mentioned solicitation. 1.  Question:  Please provide clarity on whether the Government will supply M- 11 Copper Crush Gauges. Answer:  The Government will provide one hundred M-11 Gauges, thirty days after  contract award to the successful bidder. 2.  Question:  Please provide clarity on whether the Government will supply  breeches and 105mm rifled gun tubes with at least 85% useful life remaining? Answer:  The Government will provide two breeches and two 105mm rifled gun  tubes.  These items will be made available at the Government Test Facilities. 3.  Question:  Please clarify the source for the tungsten indexing information  to be used with the tungsten rate re-opener. Answer:  Replace paragraph H.5 in its entirety with the following paragraph:   The winning contractor agrees to negotiate the cost of tungsten with the  Government prior to each option, if exercised.  If the market price of tungsten  increases or decreases, the winning contractor will re-price the negotiated  effort using the adjusted price of tungsten and calculate the cost impact.  The  contractor will submit the price of tungsten included in their basic proposal  along with the supporting cost detail for that price.  This price will be  considered the base index.  Thirty days prior to exercise of any option, the  contractor will provide the supporting cost detail for the market price of  tungsten along with a spreadsheet showing the impact on the contract price.   The Government will notify the contractor within 60 days of the intent to  exercise an option.  The maximum amount of any increase is 5% of the cartridge  unit price.  No adjustment will be made for any escalation amount that falls  within +/-10% of the base index.   4.  Question:  Verify the intended use of the additional M148A1B1 Cartridge  Cases as the answer to Question #2 in amendment 4 stated that the additional  cases â€œare for Government inventory to be supplied to the 105mm contractors as  GFMâ€.  Since the cases are not included in the list of GFM under the subject  RFP, it is our belief that the cases will not be provided as GFM on this  program to be used in the production of the M1040 option quantities.  Please  confirm that the additional cases will not be provided back to the successful  contractor under the contract resulting from this RFP. Answer:  Only the price of Clin 0001 for the M1040 Cartridges (FY06) shall  include the cost of the M148A1B1 cartridge case.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, contemplates the acquisition of High Dynamic Range Receivers and Down Converters, in accordance with FAA Specifications and Drawing number TDWR.C.116. These receivers and down converters are required to support the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR.) The TDWR receiver samples the signal received from the antenna and synchronizes the data with the transmitter pulses for determining doppler shift and range of the targets.  The down converter is a part of the receiver that steps the radio frequency (RF) of the received signal down to an intermediate frequency (IF), which is easier to process. The digital signal processor (DSP) converts the output of the receiver to a digital format for use in the weather detection algorithms. A firm-fixed-price, indefinite delivery/requirements type contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  Quantities are estimated at 10 units for the base year and 36 units per year during the four one-year options.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511. Proposals must be received by the FAA, Customer Service Desk (AMQ-100), 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73125, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, date Friday, June 23, 2006.  Hand-carried proposals (or proposals sent by overnight delivery) shall be delivered to Room 313 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 South MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Proposals must be sealed and labeled as follows:  SIR No. DTFAAC-06-R-02510; due 2:00 p.m. CST, Friday, June 23, 2006. Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for special mail handling procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center. Any proposals received after 2:00 p.m. CST, Friday, June 23, 2006, will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible. Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the SIR process. This SIR is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of proposals.

<DESC>The Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Kirtland AFB, is contemplating the award of a Near Space Operational System. This is a new requirement and the Government is soliciting for statements of capabilities of potential sources. 
This system will be an integrated communication repeater system that is balloon-borne to extend radio communications beyond line-of-sight (BLOS).  The system will be designed to launch from a remote location and controlled via a portable Command and Control (C2) system.  The lifting gas used in the system may be hydrogen or helium. Implementation of the repeater system will allow the warfighter to extend the range of indigenous VHF/UHF radios.  This increased coverage will provide the warfighter with improved battlespace awareness and integration of space capabilities with communications and intelligence.  Once established, this repeater can provide a voice or low data-rate link, encrypted or unencrypted, between points on the ground. The communications repeater will also act as a primary payload platform to support secondary payloads.  The system will be designed to support the interface or direct C2 of secondary payloads as needed with or without the use of the communications repeater functions.  The primary payload will support the ability to C2 secondary payloads.  The primary payload and the C2 system will support the ability to send and receive commands to and from a secondary payload. Ombudsman is SMC/DS. Ombudsman address is: 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, Los Angeles AFB, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659 and telephone number (310) 363-3571.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Dr. Ilmutdin M. Abdulagatov of Superior, Colorado, to procure his services for the implementation and enhancement of data capture procedures (with Guided Data Capture (GDC) software developed at NIST) for thermophysical and thermochemical properties of pure compounds, binary and ternary mixtures, and chemical reactions with preliminary critical data evaluation. Implementation of data quality assessment (DQA) procedures for the captured data through compilation in the SOURCE Database and application of ThermoData Engine software developed and maintained by the Thermodynamics Research Center (NIST/TRC) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado.  Development of DQA algorithms and implementation for volumetric properties of pure components in the SOURCE Database, also developed and maintained by NIST/TRC. Extensive experience in experimental chemical thermodynamics, thermophysics, chemistry and chemical engineering, including theoretical interpretation and error propagation analysis are required. Specialized skills include demonstrated familiarity with the TRC data systems and, in particular, TRC SOURCE data system. SOURCE data system is a major relational archival system developed and maintained by the Thermodynamics Research Center of the Physical and Chemical Properties Division to store 'raw' experimental data for thermophysical, thermochemical and transport properties of pure compounds, binary and ternary systems as well as chemical reactions. SOURCE data system is also a powerful tool to produce various compilations and critical evaluations of data in both hard-copy and electronic forms. This work targets further enhancement of NIST/TRC SOURCE database, which serves as the foundation for ThermoData Engine (TDE) software developed by Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology implementing the concept of dynamic data evaluation to provide on-demand recommended thermophysical and thermochemical property data for binary mixtures.  Dr. Abdulagatov has numerous publications (>100) in the fields of thermodynamics with the highest importance to the projects of NIST/TRC. He is an internationally recognized expert and has more than 20 years of experience in the measurement and interpretation of thermophysical and transport properties. His direct experimental experience includes measurement and interpretation of heat capacities, volumetric properties, phase equilibria, viscosities, thermal conductivities, surface tensions, and critical phenomena, which are core to the development of algorithms for assessment of uncertainties for these key properties. He has direct hands-on knowledge of NIST/TRC software tools, databases, and operations. His extensive experimental research experience makes him particularly well qualified to interpret and provide expertise in the critical evaluation of the published experimental thermodynamic data that is at the core of this project. Dr. Abdulagatov has a unique combination of skills and experience necessary to provide the solutions for all the tasks related to the proposed work. This notice is for information purposes only. No formal solicitation will be issued.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Anticipated award date is June 16, 2006.

Testing is displayed in both real time and via an archiving system that allows for comparison of results and progress of therapy. This system also provides a xenon light source.

U. S. COAST GUARD HU-25 DASSAULT FALCON JET PAINT, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT


1.0	BACKGROUND:

The US Coast Guard (USCG) operates twenty Falcon HU-25 aircraft.  Currently these aircraft are being externally stripped and painted at the Coast Guard’s Aircraft Repair and Supply Center following the completion of a required five year Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) Inspection.  These aircraft have recently been experiencing paint adhesion discrepancies shortly after delivery to USCG operational units.  Poor paint adhesion contributes to increased field level maintenance and aircraft corrosion if left untreated.  These discrepancies can be attributed to the limited environmental controls of the paint facility.  In an effort to improve performance, reduce corrosion and field maintenance cost the Coast Guard intends to have this HU-25 aircraft (CGNR 2133C) commercially painted, for field evaluation.  This solicitation establishes the minimum external paint requirements for this aircraft.
  


2.0	OBJECTIVE:
            
The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized service center with an onsite paint facility.

These areas were painted during the interim paint phase of the PDM evolution and shall be inspected for adhesion, and if necessary, scuff sanding, feathering and top coated to insure a color match with USCG coatings previously applied during interim paint as required.  Flight controls do not require removal.

2.2	Inspect seam sealants and reseal as necessary.  Do not use Bondo type fillers on   
         removable panel seams or wing tip caps.

<DESC>THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF HSCG38-06-Q-100026, DUE TO SPACE LIMITATIONS.  
The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR), Provisions and Clauses apply:  

52.212-1	Instructions to Offerors ¡V Commercial Items (Jan 2006)
 
52.212-2	Evaluation ¡V Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.

              The Coast Guard may determine the best value which merits a higher price based on  
                     technical superiority.  The Coast Guard, using sound business judgment, will base the  
                     selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal¡¦s relative capability as 
                     measured against the below evaluation factors:

		     Factor 1 ¡V Technical
                       Factor 2 ¡V Past Performance
                       Factor 3 ¡V Cost/Price

	         Factors 1 and 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While
               the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price 
               Factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

               Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical
               factors approach equal.

               Enclosure: (1) Detailed Factors
Enclosure (1)





DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical/Management Approach

The technical will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Vendor¡¦s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Painting.  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Vendor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical approach includes:
 
(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and work breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical quote that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

            (c)  Complete all work in an enclosed hangar with a dedicated space to accommodate the
                   aircraft including separate protocols for temperature, humidity, ventilation, lighting and  
                   atmospheric particle controls for the paint to cure IAW the paint manufacturer¡¦s 
                       instructions.

(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

„X	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing these services.

„X	Clear lines of communication between the Vendor¡¦s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.

(d)	The Vendor¡¦s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance, e.g., ISO  
        9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service  
        bulletins, and FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document..
.


Factor 2:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Vendor¡¦s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard reserves the right to investigate other sources of past performance other than those submitted by the contractor.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Vendor¡¦s actual performance on painting of similar or like aircraft.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.  To include experience is applying High Solid VOC compliant paints to high speed aircraft.

Contractor¡¦s customer ratings including quality ratings, customer service, warranty, recommendation for future service and performance of coating during the aircraft¡¦s operational period (e.g. gloss, adhesion, and paint defects).

               
Factor 3:  Cost/Price

Each Vendor¡¦s cost/price quote will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation or proposed cost/price.  Vendor¡¦s quote shall be a firm-fixed-price.  USCG cost evaluation will be based on the combination of the following two criteria: 1) Vendor¡¦s quote; 2) USCG travel cost and roundtrip aircraft ferry cost from Elizabeth city, NC.  There is no intent to sacrifice quality for schedule.    

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN in the Offeror¡¦s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Offeror¡¦s technical proposal.  The price quote should include sufficient detail to allow for complete evaluation, e.g. work breakdown, structure, material description, prices, labor categories, rates and hours.

<DESC>The purpose of the Human Portable Radiation Detection Systems (HPRDS) program is to design, develop, enhance, and produce the next generation of handheld, backpack, and other HPRDS units.  The primary technical mission associated with the development of these HPRDS units is accurate and rapid detection, identification, and reporting of threat material and objects including nuclear weapons, components of nuclear weapons, improvised nuclear devices, and radionuclides that can be used to manufacture a radiological dispersal device (RDD), with sufficient discrimination to separate innocent radiating materials from threat materials.  In particular, the HPRDS program will pursue improvements (display and controls, connectivity, weight, algorithm performance, and isotope identification) in scintillation and semiconductor radiation detectors through spiral development.

To obtain contractors to support this program, DNDO is conducting a full and open competition. This solicitation will result in multiple Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contracts. 

Any questions on this solicitation must be sent no later than 2:00, June 2, 2006, as specified in the solicitation.

<DESC>The following is a statement of work and a Request for Quote. Contractor is to provide aircraft services to collect data with a LiDAR Instrument(Optech 3100). The USDA Forest Service in Portland, Oregon requires the following services: 
The spatial extent of the study area will be all land contained within a 200 meter outside perimeter buffer in the study area.  This study area includes the watersheds of: Johnson Creek; Big Elk Creek, Middle Big Elk Creek; Feagles Creek; Rail Creek; Cougar Creek; Beaver Dam Creek; Baker Creek; and Sugarbowl Creek of the Coastal Range of Oregon.

All remotely–sensed data shall be acquired between October 15th and November 20th, 2005. The exact data acquisition dates within the specified period will be agreed upon, prior to the data acquisition mission, by the Forest Service (FS) and the contractor, based on forest senescence seasonality and weather.

The Contractor will: 
	Obtain LiDAR data for the study area using an Optech 3100 instrument

Specifications of LiDAR data:
	Return Density:	Minimum of 4 per square meter
	Mean beam spacing:	Maximum of 0.50 meters both along and cross track
	Beam divergence:	0.3mRad 
	Flight swath sidelap:	50%

Deliverables:
All final products shall be delivered on portable hard drive(s) with USB-2 connectivity.  All digital data and the portable hard drives will become property of the FS.  All digital data shall be in ASCII or Arc/INFO grid or coverage format in the projection parameters stated below.  All coordinate, LiDAR return intensity, and DEM values shall have a minimum of two-digit precision.

All spatial data shall be in Arc/INFO coverage or GRID format with the following projection parameters:
	Projection: 	UTM
	Datum:	NAD27
	Units:	Meters
	Zone:	10

All X, Y coordinate data shall be in the above described UTM projection.

1) LiDAR data in one ASCII file containing the following information:

-	Return beam intensity
-	Return beam identifier (1-4 with ground return always designated as “4”)
-	Forward scan angle
-	Side scan angle

2) Orthorectified Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in Arc/INFO grid format with cell size equal to the resolution of the coarser multispectral data set (0.8 – 1.0 meter), generated by processing LiDAR ground returns, and using value cells only for the portion of the area where such returns are available.
3) Orthorectified Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in Arc/INFO grid format with cell size equal to the resolution of the coarser multispectral data set (0.8 – 1.0 meter) resulting from processing Deliverable #2 to obtain interpolated values for cells without ground LIDAR returns.
4) Orthorectified Vegetation surface model (VSM) (similar to a DEM except the surface is the vegetation canopy, not the earth’s surface), of equal cell size to Deliverable #2 and #3 above, and co-registered with the DEMs generated in Deliverable #2 and #3 above resulting from processing the LiDAR first returns.  (NOTE: This will allow the FS to create a vegetation height data layer for the study area by subtracting the values in Deliverable #3 from Deliverable #4)
5) Arc/INFO coverage containing the flight lines used to obtain the LiDAR data.

<DESC>This amendment to SIR HSTS03-06-R-CAO054 provides the results of the Industry Day held at TSA HQ on 5/23/06.  Below you will find a list of all questions asked and their answers.  Additionally, if you would like a copy of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) used with this procurement, you may contact Mark Urciuolo at mark.urciuolo@associates.dhs.gov or Marvin Grubbs at marvin.grubbs@dhs.gov.  You will receive a copy of the TSA non-disclosure agreeement (NDA).  Complete and sign the NDA and return it to Mark Urciuolo or Marvin Grubbs and you may receive a copy of the SOPs.  

The following are the questions and answers from Industry Day.  

1.  What is the total number of personnel expected to be trained under this contract?
	-This is on an as needed basis.  Some airports may only need 5 people trained while others may need more.  It is based on the needs as they arise for that particular contract year.  Contractor needs to be flexible to present training for small or large groups.

2.  What percentage of the contract will be training?
	-A small percentage.  Training is based on the need for either those that have not been trained or a new requirement.  The training can be specific training or general.  Larger classes can be around 25 people while small is about 5-10 people.  There are times when a class is one-on-one, depending on the need.  There was about $80,000 put on the existing contract for training.

3.  Was training funded on a separate CLIN?
	-yes, $80,000 was funded under the training CLIN on the existing contract.   As with travel, training will be funded on as needed basis and a modification to add funding will be issued.  The Contractor should propose a ceiling value for training in each year.

4.  When will the questions be posted on FedBizOpps?
	-Tentatively on June 15th but this might change depending on the number of questions and how much research needs to be done.  Please submit questions as soon as they arise.

5.  Is there a preference to sending all of the questions at once or one at a time?
	-Either way will be accepted.  Sending a question when it is brought to your attention is accepted.  We will possibly need time to research the question so you are encouraged to send them as soon as you think of them.  All will be posted at once.  

6.  Can the font size deviate from the 12pt. in regard to the header and footer?
	-no, can not deviate from the 12pt. limitation.  Every aspect of the proposal must follow this font size, including the header and footer.

7.  If contractors use teaming or subcontracting, should the proposal include a minimum of three past performance references – 3 per company or 3 per team?
	-There should be a minimum of 3 past performance references in the technical proposal for each prime offeror.  It is incumbent on the offeror to ensure that past performance references are representative of its abilities.  You are welcome to submit more if necessary.

8  The SIR specifies spills, are these referring to VAP specific spills?
	-Yes, any reference to spills, indicate VAP specific spills – directly related to TSA or the contractor’s personnel dealing with a spill after TSA has taken possession of the material in question and extends through the time of disposal.

9.  There are no specific CLINs that address the different classes or types of abandoned property.  Are these to be priced out differently?
	-The SIR does differentiate the different Special Hazardous Materials classes of VAP but does not separate them into different CLINs.  It was not separated out into different CLINs as it would be on a needed basis.  It is not expected that these pick-ups will occur more than 10 times over the contract year.  Everything being pick-up should be priced under CLIN 3.

10.  Can you identify what airports have the mail-back program?
	-Yes, we have a list of these airports.  It is available upon request from Mark Urciuolo.  

11.  Is the Field Environmental Support contract at all a part of this contract?
	-No, this contract is totally separate.

12.  What kind of interaction will there be with the existing Environmental Support contract?
	-The environmental support contract services the field in any environmental support needed.  The field might have a specific question that may be directed toward this contractor, but may have to be answered by you and therefore you would be the contact.  We will need the contractor to be able to give correct and timely responses to the field.  

13.  Please further define the CLINs and verbiage such as CONUS, 
	-CONUS = Continental United States.  OCONUS = Outside Continental United States.  AK = Alaska.  HI = Hawaii.  PR = Puerto Rico.  SP = South Pacific.  USVI = United States Virgin Islands.  These refer to the regions of the U.S. and all locations contain TSA federal airports that will potentially need service under this contract.

14.  Will the list of CLINs be changed, adding disposal of materials at other locations?
	-We will clarify the definitions and the list of airport categories.  All additional definitions needed were included in the Statement of Work

15.  Regarding the disposal CLIN, 3ae.  This needs to be one price regardless of what is going into the container?
	-We are looking for one fixed-price per container.  A fixed-price pick-up fee regardless of what you are picking –up.  These prices may differ between regions, but we are looking for one price.

16.  Where would the requirements for audits and research fall?
	-Audits will be performed on facilities, that is TSDFs.  TSDF audits fall under this category.  You will be expected to make sure TSA is following requirements and protocol.  The audits would fall under CLIN 00002 in the base year and the “0001” series of CLINs for the option years.  

17.  What vehicle was used for the existing contract?
	-This was a fixed-price Task Order awarded under GSA Schedule 899.  The current requirements are being competed as full-and open.

18.  What percentage of small business use is expected?
	-We do not require small business use, but this is an evaluation factor and therefore a strength detailed in Section M.  No use of small business will be a deficiency.

19.  Would suggestions to TSA be placed in the Technical Proposal?
	-Any suggestions would be part of your technical proposal, but you will need to clarify why these suggestions would be in the best interest of TSA.

20.  In today’s discussion, you had made reference to a new environmental information system being established by the TSA Hazmat Mgmt Program.  How would that impact the Hazmat Management Contractor. Specifically:
-	Does the automated reporting system need to interface with this new environmental information system? If so, is it possible to obtain some basic information about this system?
-	Who is the current contractor serving in the role of Environmental Management Support Contractor (i.e., who is establishing this new system with which the automated reporting system may need to connect into)? Is the Environmental Management Support Contractor eligible to bid on the Hazardous Materials Management contract? 

We made reference to a new Environmental Management System (EMS) being implemented by TSA and our Environmental Support Services contractor. This EMS is similar to the EMS as described by the ISO 14000 requirements.  The Hazmat Management Contractor will be responsible for the technical and logistical hazardous materials management support services such as providing containers, ensuring proper container identification, marking, labeling, packaging, shipping, and final treatment of the collected materials.  The EMS is TSA's management tool. We do not foresee the web based automated reporting and tracking system, called for in this procurement, receiving or processing data or information from the EMS.  Rather, reports from the web based automated reporting and tracking system may be fed to the EMS.

<DESC>Leaf-off LiDAR Data Acquisition and Processing- provide aircraft services to collect data with a LiDAR Instrument(Optech 3100) 
There are two bid items for this project.  

BID ITEM 1
The spatial extent of the study area will be all land contained within a 200 meter outside perimeter buffer in the study area.  This study area includes the watersheds of: Johnson Creek; Big Elk Creek, Middle Big Elk Creek; Feagles Creek; Rail Creek; Cougar Creek; Beaver Dam Creek; Baker Creek; and Sugarbowl Creek of the Coastal Range of Oregon.

All remotely–sensed data shall be acquired between October 15th and November 20th, 2005. The exact data acquisition dates within the specified period will be agreed upon, prior to the data acquisition mission, by the Forest Service (FS) and the contractor, based on forest senescence seasonality and weather.

The Contractor will: 
	Obtain LiDAR data for the study area using an Optech 3100 instrument

Specifications of LiDAR data:
	Return Density:	Minimum of 4 per square meter
	Mean beam spacing:	Maximum of 0.50 meters both along and cross track
	Beam divergence:	0.3mRad 
	Flight swath sidelap:	50%

Deliverables:
All final products shall be delivered on portable hard drive(s) with USB-2 connectivity.  All digital data and the portable hard drives will become property of the FS.  All digital data shall be in ASCII or Arc/INFO grid or coverage format in the projection parameters stated below.  All coordinate, LiDAR return intensity, and DEM values shall have a minimum of two-digit precision.

All spatial data shall be in Arc/INFO coverage or GRID format with the following projection parameters:
	Projection: 	UTM
	Datum:	NAD27
	Units:	Meters
	Zone:	10

All X, Y coordinate data shall be in the above described UTM projection.

1) LiDAR data in one ASCII file containing the following information:
-	Unique ID identifier
-	X, Y, and Z coordinates (in UTM zone 10 projection parameters)
-	Return beam intensity
-	Return beam identifier (1-4 with ground return always designated as “4”)
-	Forward scan angle
-	Side scan angle

2) Orthorectified Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in Arc/INFO grid format with cell size equal to the resolution of the coarser multispectral data set (0.8 – 1.0 meter), generated by processing LiDAR ground returns, and using value cells only for the portion of the area where such returns are available.
3) Orthorectified Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in Arc/INFO grid format with cell size equal to the resolution of the coarser multispectral data set (0.8 – 1.0 meter) resulting from processing Deliverable #2 to obtain interpolated values for cells without ground LIDAR returns.
4) Orthorectified Vegetation surface model (VSM) (similar to a DEM except the surface is the vegetation canopy, not the earth’s surface), of equal cell size to Deliverable #2 and #3 above, and co-registered with the DEMs generated in Deliverable #2 and #3 above resulting from processing the LiDAR first returns.  (NOTE: This will allow the FS to create a vegetation height data layer for the study area by subtracting the values in Deliverable #3 from Deliverable #4)
5) Arc/INFO coverage containing the flight lines used to obtain the LiDAR data.


 ITEM 2 
Overview: 
Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquisition is proposed for a ~42,591 acre area of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest near Ashland, OR. The objective of the project is to map forest and vegetation stand structure in the forest and to provide an accurate ground model.  To be compatible with previous data collected, the contractor is required to use the Optech 3100 LiDAR system, which is capable of high laser pulse repetition rates (33 to 100k Hz), resulting in sub-meter ground spot spacing. Dense spot spacing provides better penetration of vegetation and detailed mapping of terrain topography. In addition, the system records four range measurements per pulse (first, second, third, and last), allowing for the differentiation of forest canopy from the bare ground, understory and vegetation density derivation. The LiDAR system is integrated with a high resolution Applanix DSS digital camera that can be filtered for either true color or near infrared images. Details of the instrumentation are included in Attachment A. 
Data Collection: 
Flight plans are optimized to cover the entire project area. In forestry applications, the goal is to maintain a scan angle of no more than 15o from nadir. The narrow scan angle minimizes laser shadowing from vegetation and increases the probability of ground returns. 
Figure 1 illustrates the target LiDAR area with proposed flight lines for average ground spot spacing of 74 cm. The system has both wide (0.3 mR) and narrow (0.7 mR) beam divergences settings. The narrow beam divergence is recommended in mountainous terrain with heavy canopy. Cost estimates are provided for different point densities in the table below. 
Schedule: 
The flight will take place during leaf-on conditions. If photos are requested, the optimum flight window is mid-June to late July, 2006 due to higher sun angles.  
_____________________________________________________________________________________ 
Specifications for Deliverables: 
Sensor: LiDAR - Optech 3100 
Standard Deliverables: One-meter digital elevation model (DEM). 
Geocorrected data for all un-gridded return signals. 
Surface intensity image. 
Survey report that includes all LiDAR mission parameters 
Specifications: Beam Divergence = 0.3 mR (Narrow) or 0.7 mR (Wide) 
Scan Angle less than ±15o off nadir 
Side Overlap: ~50% 
Average Point Density: 3.2 points/meter squared 
Sensor: Digital True Color or Near Infrared Digital Photos (Optional) 
Standard Deliverables: GIS compatible Orthorectified digital air-photos. 
Specifications: Spatial resolution: <= 30 cm. 
Spectral: True Color: (blue, green, red) OR 
Color IR: (green, red, near infrared) 
Side Overlap: ~50% 
Accuracy: <= 2meter RMSE.  
Notes: 
• The average point density considers the side overlap between flight lines. 
• Experience has shown that using 50% overlap between flight lines significantly reduces laser shadowing in forested environments. 
 
________________________________________________________________________
Attachment A - INSTRUMENTATION 
The Optech 3100 LiDAR system is comprised of a sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). LiDAR data can be collected with a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of up to 100kHz (i.e., 100,000 laser pulses per second), with lower PRF settings spanning 33-71kHz. The inertial measurement unit includes a GPS receiver that streams data from the IMU, stored independently during the flight (and differentially corrected and integrated with LiDAR pulse data during post processing). The data collection system can record all returns at the highest PRF(s) with no truncation errors (i.e. full throughput). The LIDAR system is mounted in the belly of the airplane and calibrated per manufacturer’s specification, and is also independently tested by the Contractor for internal consistency. 
The system records four range measurements per pulse (first, second, third, and last), allowing for differentiation of forest canopy from the bare ground, understory and vegetation density derivation. Return intensities are also recorded, which allows for the creation of a surface intensity image (also known as a combined elevation model ~ CEM). The intensity image provides a measurement of the surface reflectivity. In forestry applications, return intensities are often used to differentiate between hardwoods, conifers, snags, diseased/dying trees, etc. 

Figure A-1 – Raw LiDAR Return Points. 
During the flight, the pilots use a heads-up navigation display to accurately track and maintain each flight line. The sensor operator monitors the data collection on a graphical display that ‘paints’ the ground with real-time swath (coverage) and range (altitude above ground) as the LiDAR points are acquired. The instrumentation and in-flight procedures ensure that the study area is covered with no discontinuities or gaps.  
_______________________________________________________________________
The LiDAR system is fully integrated with an Applanix DSS Model 301 digital multi-spectral camera with a 16 mega-pixel detector array. The camera is housed in the aircraft sensor bay on a stabilized mount that is designed to hold geometric accuracy in operational environments to within one pixel. The integration of the two sensors with the same GPS/IMU is specifically designed for seamless image registration to the LiDAR data. The camera has a field of view of 37o and has a single Bayer detector array, so band registration errors are not applicable. 
The camera stores imagery in three bands that can be filtered to present either color (visible band) or near infrared (color infrared) imagery (Figure A-2). Band centers for the color infrared images are 555nm (green), 660nm (red), and 820 nm (near infrared). The images are stored in a native 12-bit format and the full radiometric resolution can be maintained through the ortho-rectification process. 
Figure A-2 – Example Images from the Applanix Digital Camera 

Ground Support/Quality Control 
During acquisition, a minimum of two dual frequency DGPS base stations recording at 1–second epochs will be utilized. These stations will be established on control points surveyed to CORS96 or HARN datum within or near the project area. Maximum baseline lengths between control points and airborne GPS will not exceed 30 kilometers (18 miles). 
Quality control data will be collected within the project area using a ground-based real-time kinematic survey, also linked to the DGPS base stations and collected with rovers. The rover units receive real-time position corrections from the base stations and can efficiently collect any number of ground control points within the project area (300 or more points surveyed across multiple flight lines). Quality control data are then compared to the processed LiDAR data to ensure minimum accuracies across the project area during post processing, and will be reported with metadata. An absolute RMSE will be calculated for the entire study.  

Interested parties should respond to this notice with the following prices indicated: 
1. Bid Item 1 requirements              1 lump sum  $__________
2. Bid Item 2 requirements      	1 lump sum  $__________
3. Option Item to Bid Item 2- Digital Photos 1 lump sum	                                            $__________

Items 2 and 3 will be awarded together.  Item 1 may be awarded separately from items 2 and 3.

In addition to prices, contractors must also state what LiDAR Instrument they plan to use and the availability and type of aircraft available for this solicitation.  After receipt of quotes, the Government may also request and evaluation past performance information and perform a best value analysis.
