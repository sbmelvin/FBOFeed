<DESC><p>Synopsis<br />Purchase, 7 BLU-109/B Warhead Case Test Assets &amp; Test Hardware</p>
<p>The Air Armament Center, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron is contemplating the sole source award of a purchase order to <br />Rand Machine Products, Inc., 2072 Allen Street Extension, Falconer, NY, 14733. It is intended that the award be made to support the on-going test and qualification of Insensitive Munitions (IM) and design enhancements to accommodate AFX-757 explosive fill in the BLU-109 penetrator warhead. A November/December 2009 award is anticipated for the procurement of test hardware and seven (7) altered BLU-109/B warhead cases:<br />Four (4) BLU-109 Warhead Cases are to be configured as BLU-109C/B Case Assemblies, Empty (200827956-010).<br />One (1) BLU-109 Warhead Case is to be configured as a BLU-109Y/B 6-Hole Nose Vent, Case Assembly, Empty (X68509003-010).<br />One (1) BLU-109 Warhead Case is to be configured as a BLU-109Z/B Nose Hole Vent, Case Assembly, Empty (X68509004-010).<br />One (1) BLU-109 Warhead Case is to be configured as a BLU-109Z/B Nose Hole Vent, Case Assembly, Modified, Empty (X68509004-030).<br />BLU-109Y/B and BLU-109Z/B cases will be used for testing conceptual IM improvements in accordance with MIL-STD-2105and MIL-STD-810. The BLU-109C/B case will be used to back fill test hardware inventory. The BLU-109C/B configurations are based on the preexisting BLU-109/B case configuration with the incorporation of the following improved components: Aft Fuzeliner, Aft Fuzeliner Retainer, Charging Tube Fitting, Charging Tube Nut, Charging Tube, 9-Hole Vented Aft Closure, and Aft Closure Retaining Ring Assembly. The BLU-109 Y/B and Z/B are base on modified BLU-109/B case configurations with the incorporation of the aforementioned improved components. The procurement of 7 empty BLU-109 warhead cases can only be met by Rand Machine Products because of their experience/qualification in the manufacturing of penetrator internal parts in support of Ellwood National Forge and their exclusive expertise in the manufacturing of the Eutectic Closure Retainer Ring Assembly. Additionally Rand's tooling, fixtures, inspection, and machine programming further enhances it's justification as sole source for the test assets and test hardware. The aforementioned capabilities will allow deliveries in time to meet our testing schedule. Without Rand's support in this effort the Penetrator and IM program efforts would have to stop testing until a new contract is competed and a new vendor is qualified. The Government estimates that this can take one year and would adversely impact the testing schedule and overall Program Plan by an additional one year. Rand's previous manufacturing support of 685 ARSS IM/BLU-121 test asset procurements and BLU-117, BLU-109, and BLU-122 production contracts has consistently proven to be technically sound, cost effective, and timely. Test hardware component parts will be used in support of IM test efforts on as needed basis. Eutectic, DELRIN, &amp; UHMWP/TIVAR nuts will be evaluated by the contractor to ascertain threat strength at elevated temperatures. BLU-109 Salt Fog Test Fixture and remaining test hardware to be used in Government IM testing on as needed basis.</p>
<p>Hardware shall be manufactured in accordance with (IAW) drawings. The contractor shall remove the hardware corresponding to those items listed above (Test Hardware Component Parts) from the eight (8) Government provided BLU-109/B warhead cases and install the improved hardware components IAW Empty Case Assemblies, Empty, BLU-109C/B, Y/B, Z/B, and Salt Fog Test Fixture. The contractor shall perform periodic inspections of the assemblies and the hardware it is manufacturing to ensure compliance with associated drawing(s). Inspection data shall be available for review upon request. A firm fixed price type purchase order is contemplated. It is estimated that the purchase order will have a period of performance of 12 months. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

<DESC>The Electronic Systems Center (ESC), OL-AA 950th ELSG, Network Warfare Systems Program Office, is conducting market research and as such is requesting information from Industry about standards, design, and implementation approaches to assist in establishing the necessary information to construct a contract for Digital Audio Analysis.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  It is not a request for Proposal, A Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bid, a solicitation, or an indication the US Air Force or ESC will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  ESC will not pay respondents for information provided in response to the RFI.  The RFI is being conducted to determine potential approaches to satisfy a requirement to develop an automated way to differentiate and categorize telephony call progression audio recordings that are based on the recommendations produced by the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Bureau of ITU (ITU-T).   The system ! envisioned must have the ability to discreetly identify the differences between each type of call progress tone (i.e. busy signal or phone ringing). Further, the system should quickly identify and categorize a specific type of progress tone (i.e. a busy signal) based on the pattern of the signal, even though there are potentially parametric variations (frequency, duration, signal strength) of the signal type.  The system is envisioned to evolve from pattern recognition and be extensible to other pattern matching problems such as bit streams and other digital signals.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the availability of contractor's with the technical level of expertise, administrative and management capability to perform the effort described below.  This capability statement will be used to determine the overall procurement strategy.
The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region has a requirement for vegetation maintenance services to control the growth of nonnative plant species on approximately 253-266 acres of shallow water areas, transition zones and upland zones at Hart Mine Marsh (HMM), located at the southern end of Cibola National Wildlife Refuge in Arizona.  Maintenance on this area will be required for a 2 year term.  The Government is including 3 Option Provisions in this acquisition, each with a 12 month performance period.   The Options may or may not be invoked depending on need and on available funding.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is: 561730 - Landscaping Services.   The small business size standard for NAICS Code 561730 is $7 million. 
The successful awardee will be required starting in the spring of 2010 to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supervision needed to maintain Hart Mine Marsh's construction foot print.   When the formal solicitation issue, it will require all offerors to submit a Marsh Vegetation Maintenance plan that clearly demonstrates previous experience doing this type of work in the Lower Colorado Region and display knowledge of herbicides, salt tolerant native species and other plant species in this area.

<DESC>The US Forest Service is preparing a solicitation to conduct a butterfly autecology study.  

Project Area
The Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (SMNRA). The area is a total of 316,000 acres and is located 30 miles northwest of Las Vegas, NV.

Project Summary and Goals
The U.S. Forest Service (FS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) work cooperatively under a Conservation Agreement (CA) to protect sensitive species on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area.  Species managed under the conservation agreement include 8 butterflies endemic to the Spring Mountains.  Four of these species have been identified as priorities for conservation:  the Mt. Charleston blue butterfly (Icaricia shasta charlestonensis), Morands checkerspot (Euphydryas anicia morandi), Spring Mountains acastus checkerspot (Chlosyne acastus robusta), and Spring Mountains dark blue butterfly (Euphilotes enoptes purpura).  Autecology studies to understand the life histories of these species and habitat requirements need to be completed to assist in conservation of the species.  Understanding the basic biology of these butterfly species is imperative for sound management decision making on the SMNRA.  

Goals of the project 

The butterfly management areas described below would be used to develop a comprehensive plan to better understand the ecological relationships of these sensitive species.  The first deliverable for this project would be the completion of  a work plan which would provide guidance throughout the project in order to implement the work listed below successfully. 


	Define and describe habitat and life stages for each butterfly species, i.e., what plant species are used as larval and nectar host plants, what densities of host plants are needed to support each butterfly species, and how the different life cycles (egg, larva, pupa, and adult forms) of the butterflies interact with the host plants and other habitat parameters.
	Determine what portions of plant populations butterflies are using and why.  Provide answers to what characteristics are present in those preferred areas.
	Demonstrate how habitat can be restored to yield these characteristics and preferred habitats.
	Understanding butterfly population structure is an integral part of species management.  The FS and FWS need to understand the metapopulation dynamics of priority butterfly species, i.e., including how many butterflies compose a healthy population, what subpopulations are the most important  core colonies that must be preserved and how quickly butterfly species disperse through the landscape to maintain the population.  
	The FS and FWS need to understand potential ecosystem threats to these species (for example non-native species invasions, shading of host plants through succession, altered fire regimes) and potential prescriptions that forest managers can implement to better manage habitat.

Imagery acquired in the immediate aftermath of an emergency provides situational awareness for emergency managers and a detailed record of damage for use in response, recovery and mitigation efforts. It is critical that imagery and derived products such as, damage polygons, surge lines, inundation, etc. are made available to emergency management officials in the shortest possible amount of time after a declared emergency or disaster. <br />The ability to easily and rapidly integrate imagery products with other geospatial data within a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment is also critical to effective response, recovery and post disaster mitigation missions. Therefore these imagery products must be digital, rectified to the earth's surface using conventional coordinate systems and projections, and be accompanied by complete metadata. Examples of mission support use of post-disaster imagery integrated with other spatial data within a GIS environment include: damage assessments, search and rescue, debris estimation, flooding extents and hazardous materials release.</p>
<p>The paramount concern is providing timely, accurate and sufficiently detailed information with the ability to interface with GIS to key emergency management officials.</p>
<p>1.2 PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain industry feedback on current practices and anticipated new concepts with respect to post disaster remote sensing services, imagery collection, derived products and the ability to rapidly store, orthorectify and disseminate collected information.</p>
<p>To achieve this purpose, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is evaluating the need to establish an internal capability to issue contracts for remote sensing services during emergency events and Stafford Act Declarations to support FEMA responsibilities under Emergency Support Function (ESF) 5 of the National Response Framework to provide geographic information, imagery, and analyses to all Federal agencies, ESF partners, and states. DHS seeks input from industry regarding its capabilities and solutions to provide airborne imagery and derived products quickly and in a GIS-ready form that can be used by emergency managers to make critical decisions.</p>
<p>DHS is also considering multiple Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts to meet these anticipated requirements. These contracts would be used to support "no-notice" type events characterized by little to no advanced warning, such as flash floods, tornados, and earthquakes and events for which there is the opportunity to prepare and mobilize, particularly hurricanes.</p>
<p>In addition, DHS is evaluating the need for "readiness" or "preparedness" tasks within the scope of the anticipated IDIQ contracts. Such tasks might require periodic meeting with key emergency management officials to plan and coordinate for post disaster imagery collection activities, table top and field preparedness exercises that would include tests of imagery collection capabilities, and developing capabilities that would allow DHS to have continuous awareness of aircraft, crew and sensor availability to support mission needs.</p>
<p>1.3 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>FEMA is the designated lead agency to coordinate the federal response to and support for state governments during the response and recovery from disasters declared under the Robert T. Stafford Act. Remotely sensed imagery may be required to provide situational awareness during response or to document post-event conditions to guide recovery and mitigation efforts. In either case, imagery and derived products must be acquired, analyzed and disseminated rapidly to a broad community of agencies and organizations who support response and recovery operations.</p>
<p>1.4 CURRENT STATE OF OPERATIONS</p>
<p>To meet post disaster event imagery needs, FEMA issues Mission Assignments to a federal agency that holds IDIQ contracts for surveying and mapping services. FEMA must first prepare a set of requirements (action requests) which are forwarded to the agency that is acting as FEMA's executive agent. The supporting agency prepares a scope of services and provides FEMA with a cost estimate. FEMA then prepares a Mission Assignment to the supporting agency. At this point, the supporting agency issues a contract for services.</p>
<p>The contractor obtains imagery of the Area-of-Interest (AOI) and ships the information back to its production facility for processing. Once the imagery is processed to orthophotography, the contractor makes multiple copies of the data on portable hard drives and sends the media via overnight express to numerous organizations that exploit the imagery to produce cartographic and GIS products. Overnight shipments continue until the AOI is captured and the imagery is fully processed. Development of derived products proceeds as imagery is delivered in increments until imagery from the entire AOI is collected and processed. Multiple copies of the processed imagery are copied to portable disks for distribution to agencies with top priority requirements. The data is then published via the USGS Hazards Data Distribution System (HDDS) which provides access to the imagery via web mapping services, FTP and clip-and-ship to produce additional copies on hard copy media.</p>
<p>1.5 FUTURE STATE OF OPERATIONS</p>
<p>DHS seeks to implement a streamlined post event imagery collection operation that is flexible in meeting the specialized needs of disaster response and recovery. Paramount is the need for speed in the delivery of products to decision makers and the ability to provide wide dissemination of products in an effective manner. To meet these objectives, DHS is considering multiple IDIQ contracts as the appropriate contract vehicle to support response and recovery missions. However, as this is an RFI, and not a Request for Proposals, the specific number of contracts to be awarded and the requirements for those contracts are still to be determined.</p>
<p>The anticipated functional requirement for post event imagery collection will be for digital orthophotography at resolutions between 6 inches and 2-feet using digital camera systems that deliver processed imagery in 4 co-registered bands (red, green, blue, and near infrared). In additional DHS may have requirements for the acquisition of oblique imagery of populated areas at a 1-foot resolution in natural color.</p>
<p>As further guidance to respondents of this RFI, DHS anticipates that the acquisition and processing of post event imagery will be based on the following concepts:</p>
<p>1. Acquisition will be prioritized based on the level of damage <br />It is expected that damage priorities will be divided into 3 or 4 categories. This may necessitate contractors to design separate acquisition plans for each area of damage priority because the areas will be irregularly shaped and may require acquisition using flight lines that are not oriented north-to-south or east-to-west.</p>
<p>2. Rapid Delivery of Post-Event Imagery is Critical.<br />As the contractor obtains and processes the imagery (vertical and/or oblique, and possibly videography), the Contractor will support emergency managers by publishing an uninspected version of the imagery using a temporary Web-Mapping Service at the contractor's site until processed imagery can be sent to a Government site for hosting and dissemination to the broad range of responding agencies. It is expected that the initial versions of the imagery will contain tonal mismatches and other possible artifacts. The Contractor may also be required to distribute limited copies of the processed imagery via electronic transfer. Once the acquisition is completed and the imagery has been inspected by the Government, the Contractor will produce a final tone-corrected version of the imagery. This final version will disseminated as the authoritative version of the imagery.</p>
<p>3. Innovative Technology Solutions for Rapid Processing and Dissemination <br />Contractors may also have the ability to produce an initial version of the imagery using field-deployed equipment and personnel and to disseminate data electronically from the field.</p>
<p>4. The Support System Should be Regularly Tested<br />It is anticipated that DHS will conduct an annual exercise in order to test operational plans, procedures and technologies. Contractors will receive a task order to cover the costs incurred through participation in the exercise. The exercise will require collection, processing and dissemination of imagery for a pre-selected area. Performance metrics will be collected for all activities including those for the Contractors but also for those related to government activities for acquisition, data publication and dissemination. This exercise will also be an opportunity for IDIQ holders to demonstrate and to test new applications, technologies and procedures.</p>
<p>5. Performance Must be Objectively Measured<br />DHS anticipates that advances in technology and program management will continue to reduce the time necessary to acquire, process and deliver imagery and derived products to emergency managers and planners. Further, DHS anticipates that processes for issuing and managing task orders will be refined and that efficiency will also continue to improve. DHS will develop objective measurable criteria and will report on improvement in response times to produce imagery and data products after an event.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is an update to the synopsis previously posted under M6700409R0011.  There is currently an approved acquisition strategy for this requirement, however we are still awaiting approval of the determination to award a single IDIQ contract (Section 843 D&F).  We anticipate releasing the solicitation 15 days after receiving this approval under this solicitation number (M6700410R0002).  I will post an update here when we receive the approval, so the solicitation timeline is now sliding day for day (i.e. today you can anticipate a solicitation around 18 Nov, tomorrow you should anticipate 19 Nov, etc. until I post the update stating that a single award is approved and start the 15 day clock).We will not hold an industry day, and instead will allow a period for written questions after the solicitation is released.  We anticipate the solicitation remaining open for approximately 90 days, and do not intend to entertain requests for additional extensions of the solicitation period.  The source selection will be based on best-value trade-offs.  The task-order contract, consisting of a total of five years of ordering period (including base and all options) will contain fixed-unit prices for the standard level of work (remanufacture, overhaul or repair) specified for each item, with an Over & Above CLIN for O&A work.  Unit prices will be redeterminable prior to each option period based on the applicable contract language, and/or Service Contract Act redeterminations.  The Government will not require the use of the Government-owned Commercial Asset Visibility II (CAVII) information system and instead will allow contractors to propose their own method of providing the required asset visibility.  The Service Contract Act will apply, but as we cannot anticipate where all subcontractors will be located the solicitation will not contain the applicable wage determinations.  Wage determinations will be added via solicitation amendment based on proposed subcontractor locations, however we expect that offerors will use www.wdol.gov to locate the wage determinations that are likely to be included and price accordingly in advance of the subject amendment.Please see the attachment for draft language regarding price redetermination and asset visibility requirements.  Feel free to submit questions or comments regarding this draft language, as any improvements we make now can still be incorporated into the initial solicitation.
This Synopsis is not a request for competitive price proposals. Offerors are responsible for checking the FedBizOpps website for any update(s) to this Notice. The Government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offerors inability to access the document(s) posted at the referenced website. To obtain automatic notifications of updates to this solicitation, you must log into FedBizOpps.gov and add the solicitation to your Watch List. If you would like to list your firm so others can see you are an interested vendor, you must click the "Add Me to Interested Vendors" button in the listing for this solicitation on FedBizOpps.gov. In order for Contractors to conduct business with the Marine Corps, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Wide Area Workflow Receipt-Acceptance prior to receiving an award. Registration instructions may be obtained, and online registration accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov and http://www.wawf.eb.mil

<CONTACT>Matthew D. Olson, Contracting Officer, Phone 208-387-5835, Fax 208-387-5384, Email mdolson@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an obligation by the Government to acquire any products or services.

BACKGROUND
The National Interagency Incident Communications Division (NIICD) manages a national resource of deployable Land Mobile Radio (LMR) equipment used in response to major incidents.  NIICD has approximately 250 transportable repeater assets which include VHF and UHF repeaters, linked repeaters, and cross band repeaters, to provide wide area push to talk radio coverage over an incident.  The equipment is self powered with solar or disposable batteries and generally deployed on remote mountain tops with limited accessibility in order to optimize radio coverage.  Technicians assigned to each incident deploy and maintain the equipment.  A Communications Duty Officer (CDO) located in Boise manages equipment resources and frequency allocations across all incidents.  By tracking the location and operating frequency of every repeater the CDO is able to determine areas for frequency reuse and minimize interference which greatly increases the efficient utilization of limited frequency resources.

One challenge with deployable systems is the need for ongoing maintenance of the repeaters which are battery or solar operated.  Typical battery life is from five to seven days depending on usage and most incidents have multiple repeaters deployed in locations that are difficult and time consuming to access.  Even when powered with solar panels, technicians must periodically monitor battery levels to insure solar panels are charging effectively under adverse conditions such as during periods of inversions or overcast skies.  Currently there is no way to remotely monitor battery levels so technicians must periodically travel to each repeater location to check battery voltages and establish a battery replacement schedule based on the observed rate of discharge of the batteries.          

Location information of deployed repeaters are recorded by the incident technician using a handheld GPS and relayed to the CDO (by email, fax or telephone).  The CDO manually enters this location information into mapping software and the data is used by the CDO to track repeater locations, mitigate interference issues and plan for special frequency requests to deal with congestion from multiple incidents in the same area.  Over the course of the fire season many changes are implemented and it can be challenging to maintain accurate location information as equipment is redeployed and personnel are rotated in and out.  Occasionally the CDO must be able to exchange location information with regional communication coordinators who maintain their own databases.  Updates must be manually propagated between the databases and it can be difficult to insure data is consistent and everyone is working with the latest information.  
 
The NIICD is issuing this request for information to seek comments from industry on how NIRSC should proceed to implement an automated location based tracking system for transportable repeaters.  The system should also incorporate telemetry capabilities to provide the servicing technician the ability to remotely query parameters such as battery voltage and temperature to reduce the number of trips to the repeater.  An integrated system is preferred but solutions that can provide only one or the other of these core capabilities will be considered.  

Functional requirements: 
1). Automated location tracking
2). Capability to remotely query telemetry information
3). Average current draw (<100 mA)
4). Operate in temperatures -30 to 60 deg C. 
5). Ability to integrate into existing enclosure (not larger than 2 depth x 10 x 10).
6). Ability to interface to other map software.

Respondents are requested to provide information on products that address the above requirements.  Include the following information in your responses:
1). White papers or product literature describing proposed solution.
2). Technical / performance specifications.
3). References and contact information of customers that currently utilize the technology.
5). If modifications are necessary to existing equipment/programs, describe the level of modifications necessary.

Responses will be used to determine if the Forest Service will proceed with a Request for Proposal.

Only written responses will be evaluated. Any questions must be submitted in writing or via e-mail. Voicemails and telephone calls will not be permitted and may not be answered.

The Government is seeking to lease approximately 4,500 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3,800 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (ABOAF).  The lease term requirement is for ten (10) years.  The space must be available for occupancy by January 15, 2010.  The delineated area is New London, CT.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this combined Sources Sought/Requirement Notification is to 1) identify potential vendors to meet an immediate need of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for a handheld lightweight marker (HLM) and 2) notify industry that USSOCOM may purchase up to 2000 units of these items.
<p>This acquisition is for a product that has improved size and weight over current marker systems for handoff for aircraft designation and as an objective terminal guidance. The HLM will operate in a shorter range mission set that does not require terminal guidance, thereby reducing the need to carry current markers into all battlefields.</p>
<p>The proposed HLM should meet the requirements spelled out in the attached requirement document (attachment 1) or explain how the firm intends to meet the specified requirements.</p>
<p>Interested vendors should respond to the Contracting Officer identified below with a summary of their firm's capabilities to include:</p>
<p>1. An executive summary of the firm's capability and experience in Laser Marking and Designation technology. Additional information in the executive summary should include a discussion of the proposed solution to USSOCOM's requirements to include; proposed product maturity*, current status of proposed product (concept, brass board, engineering model, in production)*, any test results if applicable, pictures if applicable, and product literature. <br />2. A requirements traceability matrix mapping the firm's product to the USG requirements <br />3. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) pricing for units to include applicable quantity breaks up to 2000.</p>
<p>*Note: It is USSOCOM's intention to rapidly review the information received under this sources sought notification and proceed to a Formal RFP and source selection to meet this urgent need. It is USSOCOM's intention to request and test product samples in conjunction with the evaluation stage of any resultant RFP; therefore it is extremely important for potential offeror's to identify the level of maturity of their proposed solution.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to request additional backup data, test results, and/or a product sample for testing and verification of company performance claims in the notification and traceability matrix.</p>
<p>Responses are due to the Contracting Officer by Noon (12:00PM) Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 17 November 2009 and should not exceed 15 pages in length (double spaced, 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font). All response should be emailed to the contracting officer and include the following administrative information in addition to the technical detail requested above.</p>
<p>1. Name of Firm (include applicable division)<br />2. CAGE code<br />3. Address<br />4. Business Size Standard<br />5. A single company point of contact (POC) to include name, title, phone/fax number, and email address.</p>
<p>This notification does not constitute an invitation to bid nor a formal request for proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Failure to respond to this sources sought notification may lead to exclusion from any resultant RFP solicitation should one be issued. Should any RFP solicitation be issued for this requirement it may be "pending the availability of FY 10 funding."</p>
<p>The NAICs code for this effort is 334290 and the small business size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer for this effort is Mr. Marc L. Huizinga (marc.huizinga@socom.mil), 813-826-6526.</p>

<DESC>Subj:  Obtaining lockdown capabilities during a security situation

Discussion: One of the buildings at the Coast Guard Academy is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historical Buildings.  The building construction consists mostly of brick exterior with lathe and plaster interior.  There are 32 exterior doors providing entrance to the building.  These doors include: 19 double Total Doors, 5 double steel doors, 4 double wood doors, 3 single steel doors and 1 store front glass door.  In a security situation all doors currently require manual locking to accomplish secure lockdown of the building.  Manually locking each door is undesirable and will require a significant amount of time and unnecessary exposure to security personnel. 

The Coast Guard Academy is seeking sources that can provide the design and installation of security controlled systems that can meet the following minimum requirements:

	Ensure the exterior doors meet minimum physical security factors; ie. security glass, or no glass penetrations, battery back-up for power failures, mechanical locking capabilities if auto-lock feature fails, etc.
	Provide exterior controls which would allow access through proximity/swipe card.  Emphasis will be placed on using smart card technology/Military CAC card.
	Ensure there is a sufficient power and network connection available to connect each door to the security system. 
	Provide software control system that will allow the monitoring and scheduling of access as well as provide instant lock down command to all exterior doors.

Consideration should be given to the glass inserts in many of the doors, which may need to be removed to mitigate a security breach.

The consultant will assist in developing and delivering a benefits administration training program to the Field Benefit Administration (FBA) and Post Valuation Administration (PVA) staff.<br />This is not a Request for Quote (RFQ) but a Notice of Intent. No, RFQ will be issued. Interested parties may however, request further information (no later than 12:00 PM eastern time, November 5,2009) by email to Contract Specialist (James Payton at Payton.James@pbgc.gov.<br /><br /><br /><br />=<br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN <br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p><br />(1) IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.</p>
<p>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Procurement Department, 1200 K Street<br />NW, Suite 1090, Washington, DC 20005-4026.</p>
<p><br />(2) NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.</p>
<p>This action being approved is to provide a Sole Source contract to Ellan Spring to perform consulting services needed to support BAPD in some key initiatives. Ms. Spring currently has a Purchase Order (PO - 08-0222), which expired on October 10, 2009. This request is being made to enter into a contract with Ms. Spring for a six month period, from November 2009 through April 2010.</p>
<p><br />(3) A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF ACTION).</p>
<p>This consulting contract is needed so that Ms. Spring can support the BAPD and the Operations Policy and Support Staff (OPSS) in developing and delivering a benefits administration training program to the FBA and PVA staff in response to the award of FBA and PVA contracts to new vendors at the majority of the field offices.</p>
<p>1. Participate in the development of training that addresses previously identified FBA and PVA training needs, as well as training specifically geared towards the successful on-going performance of field offices now under the management of new vendors.</p>
<p>2. Facilitate and support technical briefings for FBA and PVA staff on areas such as Title IV of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, PBGC regulations, policies and procedures relating to BAPD case processing activities and benefits administration.</p>
<p>3. Assist OPSS in developing training to implement new and revised regulations, policies, and procedures.</p>
<p>4. May be called upon to participate in other areas of policy development and training on an as-needed basis, as resources require.</p>
<p>Ms. Spring is a former PBGC/BAPD employee with a vast amount of experience and knowledge of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, defined benefit pension plans, PBGC regulations, policies and procedures. The time sought under this contract will be used in support of training staff in field offices in the wake of the new contract awards. As the successful undertaking of this initiative is dependent on the transfer of knowledge between Ms. Spring and BAPD/FBA staff, entering in to a contract with a new vendor will not support the effort that is needed by this request.</p>
<p>Solicitation PBGC01-PO-08-0222 was issued competitively, with a contract award date of September 11, 2008. The existing purchase order was extended through October 10, 2009.</p>
<p>The initial Purchase Order was awarded as a result of a competitive solicitation.</p>
<p>(4) AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER<br />THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for these services is 41 U.S.C. 253&copy;(2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency.</p>
<p>(5) A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED.</p>
<p>Ms. Spring possesses significant knowledge and experience of BAPD case processing activities, Title IV of ERISA, PBGC guaranteed limits, policies and regulations. The continuation of Mr. Spring's services for the next six months to administer training to the field offices will contribute significantly to successful performance by these offices during and after the transition to new vendors. The time sought under this contract will be mainly in support of the knowledge transfer that will need to take place between Mr. Spring and the field offices and BAPD staff respectively. As such, entering into a contract with a new vendor will not support the effort that is needed by this request. It is intended that at the end of this contract, the services provided will be done by BAPD federal employees.</p>
<p>No other firm can step in without a transition period and perform at the level necessary without a significant and time-consuming learning curve.</p>
<p><br />(6) A DESCRIPTION OF THE EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE.</p>
<p>A synopsis will be placed in www.FedBizOpps.gov indicating PBGC's intent to enter into a Sole Source contract for these services.</p>
<p><br /><br />(7) A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will perform a price and/or cost analysis to determine if the proposed rates are fair and reasonable. The Contracting Officer may also solicit the Contracts Control and Review Department (CCRD) for assistance in this determination.</p>
<p><br />(8) A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED.</p>
<p>No market research was conducted for this solicitation</p>
<p><br />(9) ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p><br />(10) A LISTING OF THE SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED IN WRITING, AN <br />INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION.</p>
<p>None</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Austin Finance Center, Austin, Texas intends to award a sole source contract to Visionshare to receive data from Trailblazer Health Enterprises, the fiscal intermediary for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), in order to process claims accurately for veterans that are eligible for both VA and Medicare benefits.  Market research revealed that only two vendors, VisionShare, Inc., and IVANS, are authorized by CMS for Internet-based connectivity with the Medicare fiscal intermediary, Trailblazer Health Enterprises.The VA's Information Technology infrastructure and associated disaster recovery policies discourage leased lines/frame relay connections with external data trading partners.  A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is the VA's preferred method for obtaining external data.  Furthermore, the VA's information security policy discourages installing commercial software on VA systems, if possible, in order to limit vulnerabilities and additional time and money required for system certification and accreditation.  Thus, the VA needs the vendor to host the data transfer services at the vendor site.Additional market research revealed that VisionShare is the only authorized CMS vendor that can transmit the data from Trailblazer to VA via a VPN.  IVANS does not offer data exchange services that can transmit the data from TrailBlazer to VA via VPN.  IVANS is also unable to host the data transfer services and would require the VA to install its software on VA systems.  As a result, the VA determined that IVANS cannot satisfy VA requirements, necessitating a negotiated sole source contract with Visionshare.All responses from responsible sources will be considered.  Responses must include sufficient documentation to allow this office to evaluate the possibility of your firm to submit a valid quotation.  Sufficient documentation shall include but not limited to a Trailblazer agreement to offer or propose those services in their behalf.  The determination to open competition based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If a solicitation is issued, no additional synopsis will be published.  All responses must be submitted in writing within 5 calendar days of publication of this notice.  Written responses can also be faxed to 512/460-5285 to the attention of the contracting officer on this notice.

<DESC><p>The Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) program office has an approved Justification and Approval document to award a sole source study contract to Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems located at 2000 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245 with an estimated 90 days period of performance. The contemplated contract type will be firm fixed price.</p>
<p>The study will analyze the feasibility of building an Infrared (IR) sensor payload using existing hardware held in storage at Raytheon facilities and will analyze the pedigree of the residual sensor hardware for potential use as a missile warning system. The scope of this proposed effort will be as follows: The Raytheon Space Company will inventory and confirm the availability of payload components and inspect them to ascertain their quality and status, assess the space qualified viability of the payload components and their associated documentation, and determine the degree of refurbishment, modification, or redesign required to bring them to flight quality. Using the data collected, the Raytheon Space team will formulate a plan for use of the components in an IR sensor payload. The plan will include an estimate of resources and time needed to assemble an IR sensor payload and an estimate of the cost to provide a re-procurement data package. The Raytheon Space team shall supply the assessment of the infrared capability and plan to SMC ISSW within three months after authority to proceed in order for SMC to assess the project viability. <br />The original contracts have been closed out and the technical data package is unavailable. Raytheon is the only contractor who has the test equipment and procedures available to conduct this study and evaluate the hardware. Another contractor would not have access to the existing Raytheon owned test procedures or test equipment that is critical to providing a complete and thorough analysis to determine if the sensor hardware can be used. <br />This notice of intent is for information purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. Any interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information which shall be considered by the agency. The Small Business Size Standard is 1,000 employees and responses from small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Capabilities information may be emailed to Tamara Holman at Tamara.Holman@losangeles.af.mil and Michael Russo at Michael.Russo@losangeles.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
<p>The Biospecimen Research Network seeks proposals that will significantly advance the field of biospecimen science. This RFP is designed to solicit a broad and diverse range of projects that can:</p>
<p>* Provide data to support development of reference markers for biospecimen integrity.</p>
<p>* Illustrate quality assessment measures for biospecimens used in cancer research and in the development of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>
<p>* Establish biospecimen monitoring procedures and/or tools to bolster biospecimen quality assurance for cancer research.</p>
<p>* Demonstrate how specific pre-analytical variables affect biospecimen integrity and/or the ability to yield reproducible , high-quality cancer research data .</p>
<p>* Address how emerging clinical technologies affect the integrity of biospecimens.</p>
<p>SAIC-Frederick is issuing this RFP as a demonstration of its commitment to excellence in the area of biospecimen science. With this RFP, the research community is invited to submit proposals spanning a broad range of biospecimen issues that will help define and solve the most important biospecimen challenges.</p>
<p>RFP OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act the BRN seeks to support one or more subcontracts advancing the field of biospecimen science. Projects awarded ARRA funds must be completed within a 2 year period and are subject to additional reporting requirements as described below in Section 6 - Reporting Requirements.</p>
<p>A primary goal of this RFP is to support the development and broad dissemination of biospecimen integrity assessment tools, protocols, and QA/QC measures needed to yield reproducible, high-quality data from research and development efforts that utilize biospecimens.</p>
<p>Specifically, it is anticipated that research supported by this RFP will:</p>
<p>* Enable greater reproducibility and higher quality data from biospecimens and advance the state of cancer research.</p>
<p>* Lead to the development and adoption of scientific evidence-based, standardized biospecimen handling procedures and tools for use in research and clinical procedures.</p>
<p>Appropriate proposals may demonstrate how to assess the integrity and quality of biospecimens for particular scientific analysis. In addition, appropriate proposals may determine how particular emerging clinical technologies affect biospecimen handling, quality and integrity for downstream research analyses. Subcontracts awarded as a result of this RFP will be selected based on sound scientific, clinical, biomedical, and engineering principles, but priority will be given to approaches likely to yield significant and reproducible improvements over the current state of the art. Proposals must contain a section that addresses both the level of reproducibility and technical risk associated with the proposed research, any related ongoing research by the offeror or others in the scientific community, and an explanation detailing why the proposed research might lead to significant improvements over alternative approaches and current state of the art approaches. Note: The "offeror" is the single business or academic unit submitting the proposal.</p>
<p>The following are examples of appropriate proposal topics. This is NOT an all-inclusive list and well-crafted proposals outside of the framework of these examples are invited:</p>
<p>* Development of quantitative measures to determine biospecimen quality and integrity in any and/or all phases of biospecimen processing, from procurement to analysis;</p>
<p>* Late-stage development of automated tools and/or devices to monitor biospecimen quality, collection, processing, storage and/or analytical variables;</p>
<p>* Creation of a reference set of markers that may be used to assess biospecimen integrity for specific molecular or proteomic analyses;</p>
<p>* Studies of specific plasma and serum processing and storage variables and their effects on downstream proteomic analysis;</p>
<p>* Studies of specific biospecimen processing variables (e.g., freezing, fixation, embedding, etc.), storage variables and their effects on downstream genomic analysis;</p>
<p>* Experimental comparison of prostate and/or colon cancer biospecimen quality and integrity procured through robotic versus manual surgery;</p>
<p>* Experimental comparison of relative biospecimen molecular integrity of the same anatomic tissues procured through different means, for example surgically excised tissues vs. autopsy tissues from normal donors.</p>
<p>The following areas are specifically EXCLUDED from this RFP:</p>
<p>* Development, validation and/or establishment of methods or tools in non-human systems;</p>
<p>* Proposals that are not experimentally-based, e.g. proposals to implement new management structures for clinical and/or research laboratories;</p>
<p>* Establishment and/or validation of surgical procedures;</p>
<p>* Identification and validation of new disease biomarkers.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington D.C. 20593-0001<br />Telephone 202-372-3695<br />Fax: 202-475-3904</p>

Type of Contract <br /></strong><br />The Government anticipates award of up to four (4) IDIQ prime contracts to the highest qualified firms to perform required services. Prime contracts will contain Firm-Fixed-Price, Time-and-Material, Labor-Hour, and Cost-Reimbursable Contract Line Items (CLINs). TO contract type is negotiable; however, it is anticipated most TOs will have firm-fixed-priced labor with cost-reimbursable line items, as required. Travel expenses will be pre-approved by the Government and cost-reimbursable. <br /><br /><strong>d. Cost Range, Limitations, and General Information<br /></strong><br />(1) Maximum contract guarantee for each IDIQ contract is $50K. <br /><br />(2) Cumulative ceiling price for all IDIQ contracts shall not exceed $25M. Ceiling price includes all TOs awarded against all IDIQ contracts.</p>
<p>(3) Anticipated minimum TO awards is $25K.</p>
<p>(4) Anticipated maximum TO awards are as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Environmental Planning - $1.5M</p>
<p>(b) Programming - $1.5M</p>
<p>(c) A-E Services - $1M <br /><br />(5) Maximum Fully Burdened Labor Rates (FBLRs) for each labor category shall be negotiated and fixed for the 5-year contract period. Travel shall be pre-approved by the Government and a cost-reimbursable expense. Other general cost information:<br /><br />(a) The highest ranked firms will receive a Request for Proposal (RFP). The RFP will require firms to complete a cost proposal workbook prepared by the Government in Microsoft EXCEL. The cost workbook identifies required labor categories and requires input of "base rates" for each labor category and "indirect rates" used to calculate maximum FBLRs. <br /><br />(b) The Government will evaluate each maximum "base rate" and "indirect rates" applied to the "base rates" to calculate the "maximum" FBLR for each labor category for years 1 thru 5. "Base rates" and "indirect rates" will be determined fair and reasonable, or negotiated to a fair and reasonable price, prior to contract award. <br /><br />(c) Profit is negotiable; however, profit proposed in excess of 5% is consider reasonable for "high risk" requirements, and services required for this acquisition are not considered "high risk."</p>
<p>(d) Requirement for payment of "maximum" FBLRs - The Government will pay "maximum" FBLRs only when contractor employees are paid the "maximum" base rate used to calculate the "maximum" FBLR. Reduced base rates paid to employees mandate reduced FBLRs proposed/billed to the Government. This requirement is mandated because "base rates" vary among employees performing the same services; therefore, FBLRs will vary commensurate with "base rates" paid to employees. Maximum FBLRs protect the contractor, and reduced FBLRs when applicable protect the Government from <em>overpayment</em> of profit. Example of FBLR maximum &amp; reduced calculations:</p>

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W31P4Q-10-R-0023.<br><br>The purpose of this modification is to address the following questions with answers for better understanding from potential contractors.<BR><BR>1.  Do you need the receive sensitivy of 3 uV plus or minus 1% if there is no requirement for field strength?<BR>	If this is only used for field strength, then no; however, I'm not entirely sure if that is the case.  I am looking into it with the help of the Combat Developer.<BR><BR>2.  Can the dimensions be adjusted so long as the volume is not exceeded?<BR>	These requirements were handed down to us from the Combat Developer.  This will be addressed by us at a later date.<BR><BR>3.  Could you clarify what you mean by unbreakable.<BR>	We would like a flexible antenna.<BR><BR>4.  What is the power rating of the 50 ohm load?<BR>	I am looking into it with the help of the Combat Developer.  The frequency range and power requirement might have changed the curent model of the 50 ohm load.<BR><BR>5.  Are you looking to judge the proposals on lowest cost or best value?<BR>	We use a two step process.  The bid samples are tested and evaluated in step 1.  If your product passes step 1, then an invitation for bid is issued, step 2.  The lowest cost bid wins.<BR>

<DESC><br />NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT/ REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br /><br />This is a Sources Sought announcement only. Solicitations are not available at this time. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government.&nbsp; Other North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes applicable to this request for information include 541611, 621999, 623311, and 623990.<br /><br />The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification as well as to provide a preliminary concept of operations for industry comment. Responses to this synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. The United States Congress established the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) as a separate Federal Agency in 1991 when it enacted the Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 101-510. AFRH provides residents with daily living needs, to include medical services, at campuses in Washington, DC, and Gulfport, MS. The Gulfport campus (AFRH-G) is scheduled to reopen in October 2010 following reconstruction of facilities severely damaged by hurricane Katrina. This modern retirement community will offer residential living, assisted living, memory support, and long-term care to our nation's veterans. The on-campus Community Wellness Center will encompass a Wellness Center, a Dental Clinic and will offer convenient access to expert health care. The Wellness Center will provide primary and specialty medical services in consultation with neighboring hospitals. The following services will be offered: geriatric medicine, gastroenterology, dermatology, geriatric optometry and audiology, psychiatry, orthopedics, urology, pain management, internal medicine, social service, nutrition counseling, podiatry, laboratory services, dental services, rehabilitation services and radiology services. There is a satellite pharmacy onsite along with a well-equipped rehabilitative service department. AFRH Gulfport anticipates that contractor (Service Provider) support will be required to provide all primary care (preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services), specialized care, and related medical and social support services as part of the new campus Wellness Center. AFRH-G residents will number approximately 600 when the facility is fully operational. The Service Provider will be required to schedule and provide transportation to off-campus medical service providers for specialty care not provided at the Wellness Clinic. The Service Provider will maintain all resident medical records using a Government-supplied information management system. The Service Provider will prepare and submit billing for all services performed to the appropriate resident insurance providers (e.g. Medicare Parts A, B and D; TRICARE; Blue Cross, or Other Health Insurance (OHI) provider). The Government does not intend to offer a fee-for service or capitation payment contract, but anticipates that the insurance reimbursements received by the Service Provider will constitute payment. There may be exceptions to this approach that result in the Government covering some additional costs. The Government intends to provide a near- turnkey facility that will include office and treatment room furnishings, rehabilitation facilities and equipment, medical equipment, utilities, facility maintenance, communications and information technology equipment and services. The Service Provider will procure all required medical supplies for the Wellness Center. Some specialty equipment, such as radiology equipment will be provided by the Service Provider, either on-site or via transportation to nearby (Service Provider subcontractor) facilities. The intended contract period will be for a base year and four option years. Services must be available as residents return to the AFRH-G campus starting in October 2010. The Government intends to post a consolidated response to vendor questions via FedBizOpps at a later date. AFRH-G also anticipates that an Industry Day event will be scheduled in the January 2010 time frame so that interested vendors can meet one-on-one with AFRH officials. All future information about this possible acquisition including solicitations and amendments will be distributed solely through FedBizOpps. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most current information. <br /><br />If your firm has interest in this opportunity, and you are capable of providing the required services, please provide the requested information below. <br />&bull; Company name, address, point of contact, web site link, business size<br />&bull; Company capabilities statement and recent past performance on similar-size contracts, to include references<br />&bull; If your firm is certified in one of the following small business programs, please indicate this in your response. <br />o 8(a) Program, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman Owned Small Business, HUB Zone <br />&bull; Provide any questions and/or comments regarding the AFRH-G requirements in a separate MS-Word file<br />&bull; Responders must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Registration can be made at http://www.ccr.gov<br />&bull; Please provide your response by 5 PM, November 20, 2009. Email responses are preferred.
<p>&nbsp;All responses should be sent (via email) to:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:psb1@bpd.treas.gov">psb1@bpd.treas.gov</a>to the attention of K. Hedrick, or via mail to: K. Hedrick, Contracting Officer, Bureau of Public Deb, 200 Third Street, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328, or fax #304-480-7203.</p>

<DESC>The Spring Mountains National Recreation Area has three upcoming construction projects.  At this time, there are no solicitations, plans or specifications available.  We expect each of these projects to have their own solicitations in the upcoming next couple of months.  Because it is expected that the solicitations will be coming out during the winter, the weather will make it impossible to conduct site visits during the time period for the solicitations, wo we are having a combined site visit of the three areas now before the snow sets in.  The "Show-me trips" are for 

Cathedral Rock Picnic Area Reconstruction, Desert View Overlook Reconstruction, and Lee Meadows Rehab projects planned for advertising in 2010.

Please meet the contracting officer and his representative at Lower Cathedral Rock Trailhead parking area on November 9, 2009 at 9:00 AM.

We will look at the sites, and take questions from the attendees, which will be helpful in preparing the requests for proposals, as well as helping us identify potential contractors.

Brief description of projects: 

Cathedral Rock Picnic Area:  Project is located on Nevada highway 157 at milepost 0.1.  Work includes but is not limited to demolition of existing trailhead parking area; reconstruction of picnic area roads, buildings, picnic sites and paths, water and waste water systems; and installing electrical lines for buildings and host sites.

Desert View Overlook:  Project is located on highway 158 at milepost 7.3.  Work includes but is not limited to reconstruction of existing parking area, overlook and access trail; construction of new overlook and access trail; and roadside slope work.

Lee Meadows Rehab:  Project is located on highway 156 at milepost 1.1.  Work includes but is not limited to construction of trail bridges crossing the channel near the Lee Meadows parking area and construction of erosion control structures within the drainages entering Lee Meadows.  

We would appreciate if interested companies RSVP during the week to give us an idea of attendance.  You may send an e-mail regarding your interest to Steve Roehr at sroehr@fs.fed.us.

If there are any technical questions regarding the likely work to be performed, please e-mail to Alvin Yoshida at ayoshida@fs.fed.us.

Thank you for your interest in contracting with the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area.

This is NOT a pre-solicitation notice, and there is no promise of a solicitation implied.  It is our hope and intent only.  Set-aside and sourcing decisions have not yet been made.  All interested companies are invited to view these sites.

Your reponse to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquistion method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) supports basic, translational, and clinical research to understand immunological responses and to apply these research findings to the development of effective vaccine, prevention, and therapeutic strategies for infectious and immune-mediated diseases, which includes immune-meditated rejection of transplanted organs and tissues. Translational studies using non-human primate models of pancreatic islet and solid organ transplantation are a key component of the Institute's efforts to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br /><br />In 1999, NIAID with cosponsorship by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) established the Non-human Primate Transplantation Tolerance Cooperative Study Group (NHPCSG), a multi-center consortium whose goals are to develop novel immune tolerance induction regimens and evaluate the preclinical efficacy and identify the underlying mechanisms of the induction, maintenance or loss of tolerance in pancreatic islet, kidney, heart and lung transplantation models. <br /><br />In 2000 the NIAID began establishment of macaque breeding colonies to derive SPF macaques to support the research efforts of the NHPCSG. The objective of this competitive renewal is to continue support of the maintenance and care of the Government-owned macaque breeding colonies consisting of approximately 1400 Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fasicularis) and Indian Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and to provide up to approximately 300-research aged SPF animals a year to the NHPCSG investigators.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br /><br />Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements:</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance and care of the breeding colonies, assume a colony strength of up to approximately 800 Rhesus macaques (no known non-SPF) and 600 Cynomolgus macaques (less than 10% non-SPF);<br />&bull; Establishment of directed-breeding harems;<br />&bull; Establishment of fully SPF colonies;<br />&bull; Provision of up to 300 research-aged SPF animals a year. (For purposes of this contract research-age is at least two (2) years and three (3) years for Rhesus and Cynomolgus macaques, respectively.); <br />&bull; Provision of appropriate housing. Estimated housing requirements for Cynomolgus macaques: corrals, field cages or similar enclosures to house approximately 10 social groups of between 25 and 50 animals each and approximately 15 social groups of between 10 and 20 animals each. All caging/housing must have individual attached containment areas with temperature-controlled heating. Estimated housing requirements for the Indian Rhesus macaques: corrals, field cages, or similar enclosures to house approximately 25 groups of between 20 and 40 animals each and approximately 15 groups of less than 20 animals each;<br />&bull; Provision of genetic diversity assessment and planning; <br />&bull; Provision of MHC and/or MHC microsatellite typing in consultation with the Project Officer; <br />&bull; Provision of pedigree analysis; <br />&bull; Maintenance of a comprehensive animal and colony records database that shall be downloaded on a regular basis to the NIAID Bioinformatics Integration Support Contract (BISC) ImmPort database;<br />&bull; Maintenance of continuous full AAALAC accreditation and;<br />&bull; Provision for immediate culling of all confirmed newly converting, SPF-target virus positive animals from the colonies and any remaining non-SPF breeder animals in the colony when they are no longer required.

<CONTACT>Marc L. Huizinga, Phone 8138266526, Email marc.huizinga@socom.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this combined Sources Sought/Requirement Notification is to 1) identify potential vendors to meet an immediate need of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for a handheld laser marker (HLM) and 2) notify industry that USSOCOM may purchase up to 2000 units of these items.
<p>This acquisition is for a product that has improved size and weight over current marker systems for handoff for aircraft designation and as an objective terminal guidance. The HLM will operate in a shorter range mission set that does not require terminal guidance, thereby reducing the need to carry current markers into all battlefields.</p>
<p>The proposed HLM should meet the requirements spelled out in the attached requirement document (attachment 1) or explain how the firm intends to meet the specified requirements.</p>
<p>Interested vendors should respond to the Contracting Officer identified below with a summary of their firm's capabilities to include:</p>
<p>1. An executive summary of the firm's capability and experience in Laser Marking and Designation technology. Additional information in the executive summary should include a discussion of the proposed solution to USSOCOM's requirements to include; proposed product maturity*, current status of proposed product (concept, brass board, engineering model, in production)*, any test results if applicable, pictures if applicable, and product literature. <br />2. A requirements traceability matrix mapping the firm's product to the USG requirements <br />3. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) pricing for units to include applicable quantity breaks up to 2000.</p>
<p>*Note: It is USSOCOM's intention to rapidly review the information received under this sources sought notification and proceed to a Formal RFP and source selection to meet this urgent need. It is USSOCOM's intention to request and test product samples in conjunction with the evaluation stage of any resultant RFP; therefore it is extremely important for potential offeror's to identify the level of maturity of their proposed solution.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to request additional backup data, test results, and/or a product sample for testing and verification of company performance claims in the notification and traceability matrix.</p>
<p>Responses are due to the Contracting Officer by Noon (12:00PM) Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 17 November 2009 and should not exceed 15 pages in length (double spaced, 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font). All response should be emailed to the contracting officer and include the following administrative information in addition to the technical detail requested above.</p>
<p>1. Name of Firm (include applicable division)<br />2. CAGE code<br />3. Address<br />4. Business Size Standard<br />5. A single company point of contact (POC) to include name, title, phone/fax number, and email address.</p>
<p>This notification does not constitute an invitation to bid nor a formal request for proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Failure to respond to this sources sought notification may lead to exclusion from any resultant RFP solicitation should one be issued. Should any RFP solicitation be issued for this requirement it may be "pending the availability of FY 10 funding."</p>
<p>The NAICs code for this effort is 334290 and the small business size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer for this effort is Mr. Marc L. Huizinga (marc.huizinga@socom.mil), 813-826-6526.</p>

This existing Bioastronautics contractwith Wyle is the most appropriate contractual vehicle for the work required.  Thismodification was issued using the same cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract arrangementthat was established from the original contract award. A CPAF arrangement is appropriatedue to uncertainties involved in performance of this effort that do not permit costs tobe estimated with sufficient accuracy for the use of a fixed-price contractual vehicle.
