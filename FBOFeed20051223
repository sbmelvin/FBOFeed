<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to recompete a requirement currently being performed by Case Western Reserve University under Contract Number N01-AI-95383.     This solicitation is being issued under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.   It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about March 1, 2007, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 29 FTEs.  The DMID, NIAID, NIH, supports research to understand, and ultimately prevent and/or treat, infectious and immune-mediated diseases that continue to threaten millions of lives each year.   The Respiratory Diseases Branch (RDB), DMID, NIAID, has a requirement for a multi-disciplinary clinical research contract in tuberculosis to integrate, basic and human clinical research to help answer outstanding critical questions in human tuberculosis and is seeking a contractor that will support an established consortium of investigators and institutions with expertise in the areas of epidemiology, microbiology, and immunity to conduct multi-disciplinary, multi-national research of host-pathogen interactions in tuberculosis (TB). The overall goal of the clinical studies to be carried out by the contract is to fill critical gaps in translational TB research and to provide tools needed to advance new health care interventions. The Contractor will conduct and direct specific studies that are expected to provide answers to long-standing questions about the interaction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) with its human host and to contribute to the successful development of new health care interventions. These questions include: (1) Why does Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) protect some individuals from TB disease and not others and what are the kinetics of the immune response after vaccination with BCG versus after infection with Mtb? Answers to this question are expected to facilitate the selection of boosting strategies for vaccine studies of the human immune response to BCG in target populations, such as children, and to better define clinical endpoints and expected outcomes for new vaccines; (2) Why do most individuals successfully control Mtb infection while others progress to active disease? The answers to this question are expected to facilitate characterization of infected persons and those at highest risk of progression to active disease for entry into clinical studies and facilitate the development of diagnostics; (3) What immune responses or other biological markers that predict relevant clinical outcomes can be measured in response to drug therapy and vaccines? The answers to these questions are expected to define early surrogate markers of efficacy and possible approaches for combining drug therapy with vaccination strategies. Clinical studies to be carried out under this contract will be conducted in TB endemic countries (see Dye et al.- http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/282/7/677) with substantial contributions by local investigators and, where possible, will include the creation of data that will be relevant to TB care and research in the host countries. The collaboration must include at least one country outside of the United States in which TB is endemic and which offers an established infrastructure capable of carrying out the clinical studies, including local investigators experienced in the conduct of multi-disciplinary human clinical research in TB, laboratory facilities and personnel to perform protocol-specific tests, and access to appropriate patient populations.  The contract shall also include a Data Management Center for the receipt, storage, quality control and evaluation of all data derived from this contract, and a Specimen Repository for the storage and inventory of mycobacterial strains and human-derived materials.  Supporting non-clinical studies, as well as administrative management may be conducted in the U.S. or non-U.S. countries.  Information submitted in your proposal shall be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration in each of the following qualifications:   (1) Expertise in the design and conduct of high quality clinical studies in TB endemic countries (see Dye et al.- http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/282/7/677) in accordance with all requirements listed in 45 CFR 46, or equivalent international guidelines, for the conduct of ethical and safe human subjects research; (2) Expertise in managing complex, multi-disciplinary studies in human TB; (3) Expertise with ethics committees and human subjects review boards in TB endemic countries; (4) Expertise in TB research and thorough knowledge of the status of clinical TB research, as well as applied knowledge in related fundamental and translational research areas such as human immunology; (5) Availability of/access to collaborators and clinical research infrastructure in TB endemic countries with the expertise to conduct human clinical studies in TB; (6) Laboratory infrastructure in TB endemic countries and/or in the U.S. or other non U.S. countries to provide, where applicable, immunology, microbiology, and biochemistry support; (7) Access to relevant volunteer and patient populations needed to conduct clinical studies in TB endemic countries; (8) Personnel in the U.S. and/or non U.S. countries and in TB endemic countries who are experienced in conducting human clinical studies and laboratory studies needed for the development of tools and assays for human clinical studies; (9) Expertise in developing and operating specimen repositories, and in developing and maintaining databases to support specimen and clinical data; and (10) Expertise in the development and operation of database systems for the receipt, storage and quality control of clinical and non clinical study data.  The NIAID recognizes that a single organization or institution may not have all the expertise and facilities necessary to carry out this requirement. Consequently, a contractor would be expected to include collaborations and subcontracts with qualified U.S. and/or non-U.S. institutions to provide the scientific and technical expertise and resources needed for human clinical studies in TB. The contractor shall utilize already established and well experienced clinical collaborations and infrastructure in TB endemic countries to conduct research, as well as an established clinical data management infrastructure to conduct this work.  It should be noted that this contract will NOT support the establishment and development of new clinical trial infrastructure and capacity at TB endemic sites or the evaluation of new diagnostics, drug and vaccine candidates that are submitted by the research community for clinical testing.  However, the contract may integrate experimental and/or approved drugs, vaccines and/or diagnostics into its clinical studies to define and validate markers that will provide improved information for future human clinical studies for TB interventions.  This RFP will be available electronically on or about January 6, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.    All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.     No collect calls will be accepted.    No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The requirement is set-aside for small businesses.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 334513.  The specifications for the Stainless Steel Lysimeters are as follows: Stainless Steel Lysimeters Purchase Order Duration:  One year after award of the order Data regarding  the industrial liquid addition to solid waste landfill is needed.  This statement of work outlines the EPA's need for three lysimeters in order to conduct laboratory scale solid waste research.  The lysimeters envisioned are freestanding sealed vessel that may be filled with simulated waste  material, various industrial liquids and water, with recirculation of leachate.  The design includes stainless steel construction, to reduce corrosion by the acidic leachate.  A portable press applies pressure to compact the waste media to simulate burial under a layer of overburden.  A heating  system maintains a constant temperature.  Ports are provided for extracting gas, liquid, and solid samples for analysis in the laboratory.  A computer-based data acquisition system provides near-real-time display and logging of the instrumentation.  The lysimeter system as a whole shall be air  tight.  Meaning air intrusion into the leachate collection container, and gas flow outlets shall be addressed. Lysimeters Three lysimeter vessels are required, for controlled experimentation.  The vessels shall be modular, and allow for different configurations as presented in Figure 1.  Each  lysimeter shall to be 2 feet in diameter and 14 feet high.  Each lysimeter shall be air and water tight.  The lysimeter shall be strong enough to be completely filled with water. Compactor A portable press is designed to be moved into place over each lysimeter stack as it is being filled to  compact the contents to 44lb/ft3.   Heating System A hydronic heating system (circulating warm water in tubes) wrapped around the modular rings keeps them at the desired temperature set point within the range 35?C to 55?C.   Each of the three pairs of lysimeter stacks shall have a separate  temperature control unit.   Instrumentation Temperature and moisture content shall be electronically monitored at the end of each stack using the access ports in the short sections. The instrumentation is organized into an enclosure dedicated to each lysimeter stack.  Each of these three  enclosures has front panel mounted transmitters that display pH, ORP, D.O., and Conductivity.  The output of the transmitters is sent to data acquisition system modules in the enclosure.  The modules connect to a remote computer using RS-485 protocol and a USB interface.  The computer shall be  located in an office area, and shall run a software package called WinWedgePro? that logs and displays the data directly in an Excel? spreadsheet. An additional enclosure houses the moisture content measuring system, which shall have up to 16 channels for 3 or more lysimeter stacks.  It  communicates using RS-232 protocol with a computer running the WinTrase? software package. The moisture content within each lysimeter shall be measured using a Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) system.  The Trase? system made by Soilmoisture Equipment Corp. sends an electromagnetic pulse from a  waveguide mounted in the lysimeter to measure the volumetric water content.  Each waveguide is 15 cm. long, made from 3/16" diameter 316 SS rod.  Up to four waveguides may be placed at intervals in the lysimeter stack, in the short segments. Each lysimeter shall be connected to a sump constructed  from 11 gage stainless steel measures 16" x 8" x 8" deep, with an acrylic plastic cover.  The sensors for pH, ORP, D.O., and Conductivity are mounted on the cover of the sump.  An air-driven diaphragm pump moves the accumulated leachate from the sump to the top of the lysimeter stack, where it is  sprayed through a set of two nozzles, at a rate of about 3L/min.  A controller monitors the level of leachate in the sump and activates the pump as needed.  A drawdown of 2" in the level in the sump produces about 4 L. Thermocouples are used to measure the temperature at four intervals on the  lysimeter stack, using ports on the short segments.  The type-T thermocouples are sheathed in 316 SS and mounted in a fitting that allows insertion at up to 12" depth. The conductivity of the leachate is measured using an electrodeless toroidal sensor.  This type of sensor avoids problems of  fouling, and is encapsulated with inert PFA Teflon?. The pH electrodes are glass double junction type, with temperature compensation.  The ORP electrodes are glass with platinum bands. The Dissolved Oxygen sensor is a Clark Cell type polarigraphic probe, with three electrodes.  The wetted  materials are silver, gold, 316SS, Teflon?, and Noryl?. Gas generated from each lysimeter shall be vented in a safe method.  The gas flow generated by each lysimeter shall be monitored and analyzed for Methane, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Oxygen and Hydrogen sulfide.  Ports on the outlet gas  line shall allow for gas samples to be collected and analyzed. Tasks and QA: Specifically, the contractor shall perform the tasks indicated in Table 1 below.  The design shall include a detailed break down of the parts to be used for the lysimeter assembly.  The contractor shall prepare and  adhere to attachment #1 concerning a quality assurance project plan (QAPP) as it applied to the analysis of secondary data.  The contractor shall prepare all outputs, including technical reports and peer-review articles.   PAST PERFORMANCE  Contractors shall provide demonstrated performance on  contracts/subcontracts/orders completed during the past three years and contracts/subcontracts/orders currently in process, which are similar in nature to this requirement.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The opportunity to register for this sources sought synopsis is CLOSED. Communication Security Support This is a sources sought synopsis.  The Air Force Security  Assistance Center (AFSAC), Wright Patterson AFB, OH is  seeking qualified, interested sources to provide  Communication Security (COMSEC) support for the several  Middle Eastern countries.   These are potentially separate  contracts for each individual country.  THERE IS NO PROMISE  OF A CONTRACT.    All work will be performed near a major  city within each country.   The support shall consist of  two (2) custodian managers to administer and maintain the  secure communication equipment in country.  The  individuals’ chosen will serve for a period not-to-exceed 2  years and will hold the positions of primary and alternate  COMSEC managers to the country.  The COMSEC managers must  have a secret clearance prior to proposing on this sources  sought with the US government.  This clearance will allow  the custodians to access and handle classified  information/data.  The managers will be responsible for the  receipt, custody, issue safeguarding, and when necessary  destruction of COMSEC material.  The COMSEC managers are  further responsible for the maintenance of up-to-date  records and the submission of all required accounting  reports.   Security for Commercial Contractor A.	Commercial firms with contracts to provide services  to overseas countries may register their personnel with the  Embassy.  Posts should provide security awareness  information to the employees of commercial firms similar to  that received by USG employees.  However, anti-terrorism  and security training protection is the responsibility of  the commercial firm, and this allocation and responsibility  should be written into any contract.   B.	Commercial firms may also receive security-related  information through an affiliation with the State  Department’s overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) in  Washington.  Americans incorporated or affiliated with  commercial contracting firms can join OSAC by applying via  the OSAC website (http://www.ds-osac.org).  OSAC has also  formed individual OSAC Country Councils to enable resident  US private sector organizations to exchange security  related information.  Commercial Contractors should check  to see if their post has formed an OSAC Country Council and  if so, encourage all US private sector organizations to  join.   The incumbent COMSEC managers must be familiar with the C3I  and/or C4I systems, as well as the following regulations  and/or manuals: -	Air Force Communications Security Operations AFKAG-1 -	Air Force Communications Security Operations AFKAG-2 -	Air Force COMSEC Accounting Manual -	Air Force Inspection 33-201 -	Air Force Systems Security Instructions  (AFSSI) -	Central Office Record (COR) If these potential contracts were awarded, the incumbents  would be responsible for all material in his or her  possession.  Procedures would be established to insure the  safety and integrity of the material in their control. The following would probably NOT be supplied to the  incumbent upon receipt of the a potential contract: -	Housing -	Furniture Pool -	Cell Phone services -	International Cooperative Administrative Support -	Transportation to and from work site -	Medical Evacuation Costs -	Postal services -	Commissary Issues that will need to be addressed by the each  individual country: -	Basic package (medical, security, compensation, etc) -	Information Management -	Travel Services -	Financial Management -	Building operating expense -	Workplace Security -	Personnel Services -	Workplace support (office space, equipment, office  furniture (desk, chair, light fixtures, etc), Computer) -	Personnel Security and Safety -	Administrative Support -	Shipping Costs -	Office Supplies -	Maintenance Repair -	Rest and Relaxation  -	National Command Authority Declared Crisis (State  of Emergency) -	Translation Assistance Note: -	Residential Utilities deposits will probably be  required.

A SABER contract is generally a fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract and may include a wide variety of individual construction tasks as identified in a Prepriced Database that encompass most types of real property maintenance, repair, and construction work.  During the contract period, the Government team will identify various construction objectives required to complete each specific project.  Individual projects may be negotiated or competed among the selected SABER contractors.  Individual construction task orders may be issued to the selected contractor to complete those jobs.  The contractor will be required to manage and successfully accomplish each awarded project and may be required to maintain a management office on Nellis AFB NV.  Construction will be performed in Nevada for areas serviced by the Nellis Air Force Base (AFB) Contracting Office and may include Nellis AFB, Creech AFB, and Tonopah Test Range, all in Nevada.  Individual tasks will vary in size and complexity and may require availability of a strong multi-discipline team.  The guaranteed contract minimum is $100,000 (basic year only) per contract and the maximum potential contract value is $30,000,000 over the term of the contract.  A base year plus four one-year option periods is the contemplated contract term.  The average value of SABER construction task orders issued under the current SABER contract is $220,254, ranging from $2,000 to $750,000.

<DESC>100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics, and Prevention Research (DESPR) at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIHCD) conducts epidemiologic, behavioral and biometric studies relating to reproductive, maternal, and child health.  The Division consists of the Biometry and Mathematical Statistics Branch, the Epidemiology Branch, and the Prevention Research Branch.  Studies focus on reproductive processes, pregnancy, infant mortality and morbidity, child growth and development, clinical trials, vaccinology, and community-based interventions designed to promote healthy behaviors.  These studies make use of a variety of research strategies including surveys, observational designs, randomized trials, and demonstration/education projects.  

In the past half century, labor and delivery practice has been guided by the Friedman curve. However, labor management has changed substantially during that period.   Several findings strongly indicate that new, evidence-based definitions of labor protraction and arrest are needed.   In order to establish new definitions, two important issues must be addressed.  First, what is the average range of labor progression in current population?  Second, although we can increase the time limits for the definition of labor protraction and arrest and allow labor to go longer before intervention, is it safe for the mother and the fetus?  The NICHD intends to conduct a retrospective observational study using data already collected in many hospitals and healthcare organizations in the United States to: (1) to describe contemporary labor progression in the U.S. population; and (2) to determine the appropriate time to perform a Cesarean delivery for women with labor protraction and arrest. The answers to these questions will have profound impacts on obstetric practice.

The NICHD is soliciting proposals from qualified Small Business Concerns to serve as a Data Coordinating Center for the observational study.  Specifically, the successful Contractor shall seek collaboration from institutions that have a comprehensive obstetric database and electronically stored, detailed labor information.  The institutions will also have a neonatal database on every newborn that records severe neonatal complications, and linkable to the obstetric and newborn databases.  The purpose of the resultant contract will be to compile and deliver a substantial database with approximately 200,000 deliveries from up to 20 hospitals for research and to form a NICHD Consortium on Safe Labor.

This procurement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Therefore, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this procurement is 500 employees or less.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/  for information on what is a Small Business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates number of employees.  All responsible sources that meet the applicable Small Business Size Standard may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NICHD.  

The NICHD anticipates issuing one award for a 30-month completion-type contract, with three separate Phases, for this procurement.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about January 10, 2006 through the FedBizOpps website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  

All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, NICHD R&D Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).  The reference number to be used for this announcement is: RFP-NIH-NICHD-2006-03. All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided. Questions may be directed by telephone to Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, at (301) 435-6960.

The Government does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP.  The Government also reserves the right to cancel this procurement at any time prior to contract award.  This announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

NUMBERED NOTES 1 and 26 APPLY.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Idaho, Dept. of Geography, 875 Perimeter Dr., Moscow, ID 83844-3021 to lease a Polar-adapted, low maintenance, Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (P-AERI) to be deployed in Eureka, Canada for the period February 1, 2006 through May 1, 2007. Collaborators from the Canadian Network for Detection of Atmospheric Change (CANDAC) Program are planning to commission an AERI-ER system from the University of Wisconsin for long term deployment in Eureka, Canada but the CANDAC system is not expected to be operational until early 2007 at the earliest. An AERI-ER system is needed to monitor crucial atmosphere/climate parameters until the CANDAC system is available and tested in Eureka. The Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) is an important instrument for Arctic research and monitoring that measure downwelling spectral infrared radiance from approximately 3 - 20 microns. AERI spectra provide information on key Arctic parameters such as cloudy conditions, fractional cloud cover, and infrared cloud radiative forcing. Furthermore, AERI spectra provide information on total column abundances of some atmospheric trace gases including H2O, CO2, O3, CH4, and HNO3, which play significant roles in climatically important processes such as the carbon and ozone cycles. The extended range AERI (AERI-ER) is particularly well suited for many of these observations because it provides both high accuracy and precision and can operate in the polar darkness when solar transmission instruments are not useful.  

The system is required to have a 1/cm resolution, a spectral range of at least 3-20 microns, a robust and documented calibration, shall operate autonomously, and be specifically adapted to operate in Polar environments. Prior successful operation in Polar conditions must be demonstrated. In addition, quality controlled data sets, containing calibrated spectral radiance measurements at the specified resolution and spectral range, must be provided to NOAA within three months of observation time.

This announcement is being issued under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13 (under $100,000). Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any responses shall be received in writing no later than January 9, 2006. Anticipated Award date is January 10, 2006.

<DESC>This is a Request For Information for the purposes of conducting market research.  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) plans to issue one or more solicitation(s) to create an enterprise wide system that traverses on the existing and future TSA network infrastructure designed to communicate security equipment text and data between various TSA sites, at both local and national level.  This RFI does not constitute a future contract and vendors shall not be compensated for providing information.  There is no solicitation available at this time, TSA is currently performing a market survey to determine if vendors exist that can meet the following concept. The concept that is being investigated will be to develop a gateway between all existing and future airport security equipment across 450 airports nationwide and a centralized data collection/distribution management center. The goal will to be to provide TSA with a dynamic and completely configurable system that supports near real time information about existing and future deployed airport security equipment. The types of airport security equipment being considered as part of this RFI includes Threat Image Projection (TIP) Ready X-rays, Explosive Trace Detectors, Explosive Detection Systems, and Walk Through Metal Detectors.  The concept will provide for administrative and technical communications such as remote maintenance monitoring (RMM), property management, configuration management, resource management and collection/distribution of equipment and screener performance information. Specifically, TSA seeks to obtain (1) information about solutions based on vendor experience in environments similar to TSA, (2) information about products and services offered by industry that provides a turn key solution that meets the above concept, and (3) suggestions on alternative approaches to minimize total life cycle cost.  

Background:  TSA is responsible for “protecting the Nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.”  The proposed concept is an initiative being investigated by TSA that incorporates enterprise management of assets, training efficiencies, data collection, trend analysis and remote maintenance monitoring from a local and national level as a business process improvement solution.  

There are over 12,000 pieces of airport security equipment installed nationwide including Explosive Detection Systems TIP Ready X-ray, Explosive Trace Detectors and Electronic Metal Detectors. These machines contain performance information that is collected through manually intensive processes. Thus, TSA is seeking an automated cost-effective solution to transmit specific data from the airport security equipment located within an airport to centralized data management center.  The concept that is being investigated includes the following properties: 
• Provide near-real time remote maintenance monitoring of security assets.  The RMM will support an improved maintenance strategy and concept. 
• Provide near-real time monitoring of screener and equipment performance;
• Provide security equipment inventory management and movement tracking;
• Provide a COTS solution that adheres to Industry standards including open systems architecture.

<SUBJECT>L--Adaptive Logistics in Support of Sense and Respond Logistics (S&RL)
<SOLNBR>W74V8H-06-T-0024
<RESPDATE>010906
<ARCHDATE>03102006
<CONTACT>Peggy Pennie, 703-697-0801
<DESC>1.    Background Sense and Respond Logistics (S&RL) is a principal tenet of the Focused Logistics Joint Functional Concept and is a critical enabler to transformation.  The concept of S&RL relies upon highly adaptive, self-synchronizing, and dynamic physical and functional  processes, employing and enhancing operational decision support.   The S&RL concept predicts, anticipates and coordinates actions that provide warfighting advantages spanning the full range of military operations across the strategic, operational and tactical levels of war.  It requires a network-centric enterprise and di sciplined collaboration within and across Communities of Interest (COI) from the tactical point of effect through the strategic base.   Synchronizing the logisticians decision cycle to that of the warfighter enables a logistics system that is focused on the effect a given action in the logistics domain will have on the warfighters planned or executing intent.  The end state is for logist icians to operate within the construct of a global, end-to-end distribution based enterprise that synchronizes and integrates all elements of the logistics system to ensure consistent, reliable, and predictable support to the Joint Force Commanders concep t of operations.   As a means of moving towards this end state, the Army Center for Logistics Innovation (CLI) is currently building an Adaptive Logistics Command and Control (C2) capability to be achieved through spiral development.  The objectives of this capability are to : a.	Achieve asset and event visibility throughout the enterprise from the strategic base to the point of the effect b.	Ensure communication capability to achieve Adaptive Logistics C2 c.	Achieve data standardization through Common Logistics Operating Environment (CLOE) standards d.	Employ Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or high technology developmental products to achieve Joint Collaboration and Command and Control The approach to achieving these objectives is to build a series of tools that can be transitioned to a Leave-Behind Capability that that can be expanded and utilized within   the Armys current Command and Control infrastructure. 2.    Request This request seeks information from vendors and developers of COTS products and applications that further objective d., above.  It supports a market survey of capabilities that support manage by wire (see paragraph 3 below) in an Adaptive Logistics envir onment.  Selected vendors will be invited to present information concerning their products at an Industry Day to be held on 17-19 January 2006 in the National Capital Region.  CLI will be assisted in this selection by support contractor personnel who hav e signed Non-Disclosure Agreements.  Information provided pursuant to this request will not be shared with any of the other respondents or with personnel who are not directly involved in the evaluation of the responses. Please be advised that this request does not constitute any commitment on the part of the Government and does not guarantee that a formal request for proposal or delivery order will be issued. 3.    Manage by Wire and Sense and Respond Logistics (S&RL) This paragraph is a brief synopsis of the terms manage by wire in the context of S&RL and Logistics Command and Control.  A fuller treatment is available in the Army S&RL Vision Document (Reference 6.a.), which is available from CLI upon request.  That d ocument also contains full definitions of the terms that are used. The term Manage by Wire is a central tenet of the S&RL concept.  Originally, this term was coined to characterize the piloting of modern high-performance aircraft, where the speed and complexity of the task is beyond the capabilities of a pilot.  The integ rated man-machine system must observe (sense environmental signals), orient (interpret the signals), decide (select from a number of possible responses), and act (execute the response) under time-critical co nditions.   Manage by Wire was adapted by Stephan H. Haeckel to describe an adaptive, or SIDA (Sense, Interpret, Decide, and Act) process that handles complex events within modern logistics organizations, where large volumes of data must be rapidly processed, inte rpreted, evaluated and acted upon.  Unlike its aircraft analogy, manage by wire in the context of Joint logistics requires the capability to design dynamic organization structures as a role and accountability system by clearly articulating purpose, bound aries, relationships, and performance metrics based on the Commanders Intent.  It requires dispatching capabilities from the customer request back through demand satisfaction networks that are self-synchronized and dynamically reconfigured in response to each customers request.  Finally, it requires coordinating these ad-hoc, adaptive roles (Communities of Interest) and tracking the dynamically changing status of who owes what to whom?  It should be noted that the SIDA loop is a closed feedback system  that constantly monitors execution of the actions taken in terms of speed and quality of effects.  The Armys Sense and Respond Logistics Vision requires that we: "	Move from stove-piped processes and information systems to a collaborative enterprise "	Deliver improved context that is shared by warfighters, forward deployed logisticians, materiel and logistics force providers, program managers, and commercial partners  "	Deliver live correlated information and real-time situational awareness to those whose actions can affect the battle (present and future) "	Deliver a dynamic common operating picture to logistics commanders and operational staffs "	Deliver multiple data feeds in a tailored view that can be pushed out to logisticians across the continuum "	Move from tool-centric to service-centric architecture. In the context of Logistics Command and Control, manage by wire implies the leveraging of people, process, and technology to provide: Capability	Key Element(s)	SIDA Component "	Fine-grained visibility	Actionable Information/Autonomics	Sense "	Knowledge of the state of the world	Business Intelligence	Sense "	Effective execution monitoring	Business Intelligence/Intelligent Agents	Sense "	Situational understanding	Actionable Information	Interpret "	Event impact analysis	Event Management	Interpret "	Real-time collaboration	Communities of Interest	Decide "	Dynamic, adaptive plans	Advance Planning and Optimization	Decide "	Informed decisions	Actionable Information	Decide "	Logistics integration with Operations and Intelligence	Customer Relationship Management	Act "	Effect timely change	Adaptive Logistics	SIDA 4.    Scope of Request The U.S. Army CLI has identified the following key technologies for bringing about an Adaptive Logistics capability.  This request focuses on, but is not limited to these products/capabilities. "	Cognitive decision support agents for intelligent planning and reasoning, rapidly predicting logistics requirements and establishing priorities based on the Commanders intent and Commanders Critical Information Requirements. "	Data fusion agents for gathering, translating, fusing and presenting data from disparate sources, as well as discerning patterns from multiple, disparate data sets, including sensory networks. "	Collaboration tools and agents that define Communities of Interest for managing events, sharing information, evaluating courses of action, and monitoring mission execution.  "	Situation manager agents that enhance the commanders confidence in the system through automated sentinels, analysis and alerts that provide continuous, relevant feedback without burdensome and complex queries. "	Products and technologies that facilitate data exchange in austere communications environments. "	COTS tools for Business Intelligence, Advance Planning and Optimization, Event Management, Customer Relationship Management, and data management th at can be readily bolted-on to Global Combat Support System-Army (SAP-based) and Theater-level Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3) within the Standard Army Logistics Environment (SALE) architecture.  (These systems, the SALE architecture, an d the Common Logistics Operating Environment (CLOE) are described in references 6b through 6d, which are also available from CLI.) 5.    Requested Information Respondents are requested to provide the following information about their COTS or developmental products. a.	Product Name and acronym (if appropriate). b.	Executive Summary describing the product, its history, objectives, technology, and market space. c.	Product literature or Web site links that describe the product, technology, capabilities, and specifications. d.

<SUBJECT>65 -- NOTICE OF INTENT - SOLE SOURCE
<DESC>Notice of Intent – Sole Source

The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a sole source commercial purchase order in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This notice documents and incorporates provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-06, 30 Sep 05.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 339113 and the size standard is 500 employees.

The government has determined that Arthrocare Corporation is the only source that can satisfy this agencies requirement.  The requirement is to purchase electrosurgical supplies (Turbo Vac Arthrowand and Ultra Vac Wands) plus option quantities.  Arthrocare products are the only products compatible with existing Bovie generator equipment.  Test use of other vendor-stated “compatible wands” rendered the equipment inoperable (the generator unit is far more expensive than these disposable wands).  The Arthrocare wand is identified by our surgeons as the only wand for their trained orthopedic specialist and provides optimum cutting and cauterization technique employed.  Non-Arthrocare products would increase operating case times, establishment to open cavity surgical procedures, increase post operative pain to patients and changes to surgical procedures throughout the entire Operating Room. Arthrocare is the only brand name/sole source that can satisfy the government’s requirements.  


All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  

Any company that feels they have items that meet the needs of the Government must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>V -- Proteus Target Board Flight Hours Support
<DESC>Notice of Contract Action for a Sole Source Procurement

SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR the purchase of Flight Hours and Flight Hours support services required to fly the Proteus Target Board System (PTBS) aboard the Proteus Aircraft. 

DESC: INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT WITH Scaled Composites, LLC.  The Air Force, Edwards Air Force Base, CA intends to award a Sole Source Cost-Plus Fixed-Fee contract to Scaled Composites, LLC, 1624 Flight Line, Mojave, CA 93501-1663.  The Sole Source purchase will be for the following non-commercial services.

Scaled Composites will provide flight hours and flight services to fly the PTBS.  The Proteus aircraft will carry the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Lab (MIT/LL) PTBS with associated subsystems, which will be used to collect Airborne Laser (ABL) target data.  

Scaled Composites will perform the following actions as part of the flight hours and associated flight service support tasks required for this effort.

·	Provide the Proteus aircraft and all flight and maintenance crews.

·	Perform ferry operations to support target board transportation to and from locations supporting flight tests and target board maintenance.

·	Functionally check and calibrate the applicable instrumentation prior to commencing flights.

·	Provide ground support for pre-flight checkout of the aircraft, target board and associated systems at the Scaled Composites facility and deployed locations.

The ABL test program requires access to various test targets to characterize, verify, or demonstrate inherent weapon system capabilities such as target acquisition, tracking and pointing.  These tests will be accomplished, over the course of the next four years at various test ranges.  These include: Edwards AFB, Hanscom AFB, Vandenberg AFB, White Sands Missile Range, Holloman AFB, Ft Biggs, and Scaled Composites in Mojave, CA.  During this time period, it is not anticipated that another vehicle capable of carrying the test bed will be developed and built.

The Proteus aircraft is a manned twin turbofan high altitude multi-mission aircraft powered by Williams International FJ44-2E engines leased and operated by Scaled Composites, LLC, Mojave, CA.  The aircraft is designed to support long duration high altitude operations carrying a variety of “customer specific” payloads.  Specifically, it is designed to carry payloads in the 2000-pound class to altitudes above 60,000 feet and remain on station up to 14 hours.  The ABL program office has selected the Proteus aircraft to carry the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)/Lincoln Lab (LL) target board in support of the ABL test program requirements.  The Proteus aircraft is the only aircraft capable of carrying the target board.  It was specifically designed and built to carry the target board.  This J&A addresses the Proteus flying and engineering hours in direct support of ABL test program requirements.  

It is important to note that the specific ABL payload, the PTBS, which will be carried by Proteus, is the responsibility of the MIT/LL.  MIT/LL is responsible for the target board design, fabrication, integration, and characterization as required to support ABL program requirements.  

Scaled Composites is currently contracted by MIT/LL.  Since the ABL program office has selected the Proteus aircraft, which has been specifically leased to Scaled Composites, to carry the MIT/LL target board, the proposed contractor is the only contractor that is authorized to supply and support the Proteus aircraft.

To immediately support testing, Scaled Composites has personnel that meet or exceed the qualifications needed to support testing, as well as unique detailed knowledge of the PTBS.  Scaled Composite has locally operated offices with the required expertise readily available to the AFFTC, and supporting bases, and personnel with a demonstrated background in the following areas:

·	Personnel proficient in the technical theory and testing of the PTBS and Proteus aircraft.

·	Personnel proficient with the operation and maintenance of general and special test equipment and their application. 

·	Personnel familiar with the operation, resources, equipment, proper handling, care, loading and unloading of the PTBS. 

·	Personnel with a demonstrated understanding of the operations, characteristics, limitations and capabilities of the Proteus aircraft and PTBS.
Scaled Composites also meets the requirements to store and secure the target board.  They have a secured area able to accommodate the storage and special handling of the target board due to its unique environmental requirements.
Scaled Composites will continue to provide to MIT/LL the design, engineering, and development support for the PTBS and provide flight services for the Proteus to fly the target body.

Scaled Composites, LLC is the only known source that can satisfy the requirements of the Government at this time.

Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the Flight Hours and Flight Hours support services.  Responses may be sent via e-mail to philip.cheng@edwards.af.mil or mailed to 412 TW/PKDB, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Philip Cheng.  Fax Number: 661-275-7827.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  If the office has not received any affirmative written responses by Close of Business (COB), 23 Jan 06, a Sole Source contract award will be pursued with Scaled Composites, LLC, 1624 Flight Line, Mojave, CA 93501-1663.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES

The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

Performance Work Statement (PWS):
Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)
Electronic Document Workflow (EDW) Web-based Training (WBT) 

1. Purpose of this PWS: 
The objective and scope of this effort is to provide a Web-based Training (WBT) package for the Electronic Document Workflow (EDW) 4.0 application for DCMA users.  DCMA users will take this training to become familiar with the changes provided by the new version of EDW.
2.  Background Information About DCMA:
DCMA is the Department of Defense agency responsible for working with the Defense industry to help ensure that systems, supplies, and services are delivered on time, at projected costs, and meet performance requirements.  This involves managing 320,000 prime contracts with current work valued at $850 billion.  
DCMA is headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia (with a mailing address of Alexandria, VA), and employs over 11,000 civilian and military professionals worldwide.   The agency is organized into three Districts: East, headquartered in Boston, MA; West, headquartered in Carson, CA; and International, which is co-located with the agency headquarters.  The districts are further subdivided into 60 Contract Management Offices (CMOs) that work with Defense industry SPs at over 900 locations worldwide.
3. EDW v4.0 Web-based Training (WBT)
The Service Provider (SP) shall provide software training on EDW v 4.0 to familiarize DCMA users with this version. The development of the WBT shall have four phases, outlined this section:
1.	Discovery
2.	Design
3.	Development
4.	Implementation/Revision
3.1 Discovery Phase
During a preliminary discovery phase, the SP shall recommend an overall training strategy. The SP will include the selection and organization of lesson topics, learning objectives, look and feel, and functionality, such as navigation.  All course content will be considered with and approved by DCMA prior to design.
The SP shall:
•	Meet with DCMA to formulate the training design concept and content for the project.  
•	Conduct analysis on the target audience, learning objectives, and required course content.  
•	Produce a Design Guide that will describe the WBT appearance, navigation method, course theme, and multimedia treatment.  
3.2 Design Phase
The SP shall develop storyboards from the design documentation in MS PowerPoint or MS Word format sufficient that users will be familiarized with EDW v 4.0.  

3.3 Development Phase
The SP shall develop and test the EDW v4.0 WBT product. The SP shall also develop an electronic set of quick reference procedures, called “Just-in-Time” training (JIT). The JIT shall be located within the EDW application. The SP shall design the JIT for users who have already completed the WBT, but need a topic refresher.
3.4 Implementation/Revision
The SP shall:
•	Deploy EDW v 4.0 training to DCMA users. 
•	Refine the web-based training course as required, based on official direction from this project’s COTR

•	Provide all deliverables by the agreed upon delivery date.
•	90% of survey takers respond with a “Neutral, Satisfied, or Very Satisfied when asked “Did this course meet your expectations?” on an end of training survey.  Responses include: Very Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied, or Very Satisfied.
6. Periodic Adjustments of Performance Standards:
In its experience with other performance-based instruments, DCMA has found it not only advisable but necessary to adjust performance standards periodically.  That is because particular written expressions of performance standards sometime inadvertently motivate services provider behaviors that act against achievement of the desired performance objectives.  Having learned that lesson, DCMA intends to apply it to this PWS.  Accordingly, DCMA reserves the right to adjust any or all performance standards in this PWS, up to and including the addition of entirely new performance standards and complete substitutions of new performance standards for those already existing in this PWS or as may have been included by subsequent modifications of this document, at any time at the DCMA Information Technology Customer Service Organization’s (ITCSO’s) discretion—subject, of course, to the stipulations in the “Changes” clause of any resulting contract.  DCMA, however, does not plan to make any such adjustments more often than once each calendar quarter and in fact would prefer not to make them any more frequently than once each calendar year.       
7.  Period of Performance:
Both Phase I and Phase II are to be completed within 13 weeks after the contract award date.
8.  Security:  
SP personnel assigned to this effort will perform in an ADP III designated sensitive position due to the nature of the work performed.
Access to DCMA Information Technology (IT) unclassified systems/network is authorized.  In accordance with the DoD5200.2R, Personnel Security Program Regulation, contractor personnel performing services in Automated Data Processing (ADP) positions equivalent to the duties of duties equivalent to ADP-II or ADP-III positions shall be the subjects of a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check; however, for ADP II positions a NAC must be completed prior to performance on this contract. DCMA security personnel will validate proof of existing favorably adjudicated investigations. DCMA Security Office at 6350 Walker Lane, Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22310 will process new investigative requests.
When in DCMA-owned or controlled buildings or other facilities, SP personnel shall display DCMA-issued identification badges in accordance with the directions provided by this contract’s COTR.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NOTICE: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 182P0600171 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 01-27. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 323119 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit a quote. The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on Thursday, January 5, 2006 at 17:00:00 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com. FOB Destination shall be Alexandria, VA 22314 <BR><BR>The US Patent & Trademark Office requires the following items, MEET OR EXCEED, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, Review the Fallowing Vendor Q&A -------------Q1.) Is the 2005 PAR (on which this Highlights book is to be based) completed?  Answer: Yes Q2.)Is it accessible online? Answer: Yes, http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/annual/2005/2005annualreport.pdf Q3.)Regarding the scenarios: in scenario one, is it expected that 500 printed copies must be available by January 31, or is it sufficient that the design work be completed and sent to press? Answer: forget scenario one.  Now just the layout/management/design plus, about 20 finished copies.  The January deadline is no longer pressing.  We would, however like this work completed soon.  February seems reasonable but I will defer to your insight on this matter. Q4.)Is the contractor expected to provide the CD-ROM with the PAR, or will the Government provide the CDs?   Answer: Since there are so few copies to be produced we can provide the finished CDs.  We will, however, need the contractor to insert the CD in the plastic pouch and affix the pouch to the inside back cover. Q5.)Design Questions: A.)Will client provide all written content? Answer: There will be no new content; all will come from the full PAR.  We expect the contractor to help us select the content to be included in the Highlights.  Q6.)Will client be providing any or all artwork? Answer:  All artwork will come from the full PAR.  It may need to be resized to fit the smaller pages of the Highlights but there will be no new artwork. Q7.)In reference to &quot;Meeting with USPTO management and staff&quot;, will teleconference suffice or will the project require meeting in person? Answer: In person meetings are preferred. Printing/Production Questions: Q8.) How would the client like the booklet bound? Answer: We would prefer the final product to be flat, without a spiral.  Other agency's Highlights we've seen are stapled like a magazine.  We are open to your proposals for binding. Q9.)In the following statement of the bid does this mean there will be no printing on the inside of the front and back cover?  Answer: We expect there to be full color printing on the inside and outside of the cover.  The cover should be of heavier stock to both protect the pages and give support to the CD affixed to it. Q10.) There are many different options for the CD holder.  An economically  preferred option would be to include a plastic sleeve held into a spiral bound booklet.  A much lass economical option would be a die cut cover that would create a pocket that is actually part of the inside cover.  I only ask because there is significant difference in cost.  Which would  the client prefer? Answer: we would prefer the plastic sleeve.    Q11.) What are the exact dimensions of the &quot;soft envelope like cover&quot; that  will fit into the pocket?  Will the &quot;soft envelope like cover&quot; be provided by the client or should it be included in the quote?   Answer: This was referring to the plastic sleeve to hold the CD.  We will not be providing it; it should be included in the quote.   Q12.) Will the client be inserting the CDs into the booklet or should our quote include assembly?  Answer:  This should be included in the quote. ------------------------------ SEE ATTACHED SOW - FY2005 United States Patent and Trademark Office Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) HIGHLIGHTS, 1, EA; <BR><BR>For this solicitation, US Patent & Trademark Office intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc.

The average flight lasts for duration of five hours resulting in the low engine cycles.  The engine has been on the Trend Group/Dallas Airmotive, Turbine Engine Monitoring Program (TEMP) since November 1990.  Oil samples were taken every 100 hours up until December 2001 when the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) elected to take samples on condition.  The engines will be delivered to the overhaul facility in serviceable condition, or as removed from an airworthy aircraft.  This work must be scheduled for the January/February 2006 timeframe.  

The following is data applicable to the engine as it is estimated to be upon delivery to the Contractor’s overhaul facility.
