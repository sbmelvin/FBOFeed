<SOLNBR>CC-VOYA003-05
<RESPDATE>031105
<ARCHDATE>01062006
<CONTACT>James Hummel Chief Ranger 21828391076156 ;
<DESC>The National Park Service intends to issue a concession prospectus on January 10 for the continuation of Scheduled Interpretive Sightseeing Tourboat Services at Voyageurs National Park.  This business opportunity is a summer operation of Scheduled Sightseeing Tourboat Services within Kabetogama, Namakan, Sand Point, and Crane Lakes, with interpretation services.  The concessioner may provide shuttle service to transport customers between landing locations in between stops on a regularly scheduled tour.  Merchandise sales may also be provided upon the Sightseeing Tourboat vessel.  Tourboat services depart from Voyageur's Kabetogama Visitor Center.  The tourboat operating season is mid-June through the fourth Saturday in September.  Voyageurs National Park is located on the northern edge of Minnesota's border with 55 miles of the park meandering along the Canadian border.  Water dominates the landscape of Voyageurs, including four large lakes - Rainy, Kabetogama, Namakan, and Sand Point, which cover approximately 40-percent of the 218,054 acres of Voyageurs.  Voyageurs is unique because it is a water-based national park, with approximately 8 miles of road.  Voyageurs is located off of U.S. Highway 53.  Voyageurs is located near the communities of Kabetogama, Ash River, Crane Lake and International Falls, Minnesota, and is 300 miles north of Minneapolis-St. Paul.  Additional information about the park can be viewed at the following web site: http://nps.gov/voya/.  The average annual visitation to the park is approximately 242,000 visitors annually.  The new concession contract will be for 10 years.  Further details are available in the Prospectus.  The National Park Service has determined, in accordance with 36 CFR Part 51, Subpart F, that the new concession contract is a qualified concession contract as the anticipated annual gross receipts are not expected to exceed $500,000.  However, notification has been received from the current concessioner that they will not be submitting a proposal for this operation.  Therefore, if the current concessioner submits a proposal they will have a right of preference.  Any offer must be received in the Concession Management Office of the National Park Service in Omaha, Nebraska, Midwest Regional Office, 601 Riverfront Drive, Omaha, NE  68102 no later than 4:00 p.m. on the response date shown above, in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract to provide visitor services in Voyageurs National Park.  The cost for purchasing a prospectus is $15 by mail or $10 if picked up in person at the address below.  Parties interested in obtaining a prospectus should mail or bring a check or money order in person (NO CASH SALES) made payable to "National Park Service".  A Tax Identification Number (TIN) or Social Security Number (SSN) must be provided on all checks.  Prospectus copies can be obtained at the following address for in person pick-up or federal express: National Park Service, Voyageurs National Park, 3131 Highway 53, International Falls, Minnesota, 56649-8904.  If purchased by mail, the front of the envelope should be marked "ATTENTION: CHIEF RANGER- MAILROOM DO NOT OPEN".  You must include in your request for the prospectus a delivery address that will accept a Federal Express package.  Inquiries on purchasing a prospectus may be directed to Mr. Jim Hummel, Chief Ranger at (218)283-9107 extension 6156.  An electronic copy of the prospectus is not available.  The prospectus, when issued, will contain information on the business opportunity, the new concession contract, the proposal package and terms and conditions under which the National Park Service will award the new concession contract.

<ARCHDATE>07062005
<CONTACT>POC: Roy Higgins, 781-377-5657, roy.higgins@hanscom.af.mil. Contracting Officer: Capt Aaron Boyd, 781-377-2267
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to change the Solicitation No. for the PERSONAL INDENTIFICATION CREDENTIAL SYSTEM (PICS), as published on 8 Oct 2004 in FedBizOpps, From: 'FA8728-04-R-9001' ... To: 'FA8728-05-R-0002' .. therefore, any further information which may be posted with regard to 'PICS' will have revised Solicitation No. FA8728-05-R-0002 associated with it.<br><br> Original synopsis (released 8 Oct 2004): Research and Development Sources Sought for a Personal Identification Credential System (PICS). PICS is a Government effort to produce a system that will allow rapid and secure entry control to Government installations through the use of an identification device activated by a biometric signature. The Government is looking for a close to credit card-size device, including a fingerprint sensor, to be issued to each user. Fingerprints are to be used for the biometric identification due to the high maturity of the technology. Notional components of a PICS system include (but are not limited to) the hand-held personal devices issued to users, a reader to interface the hand-held at the entry point to a local database, an enrollment station to register the hand-held to the individual user, and any supporting hardware and software needed to integrate the system into an entry point to Hanscom AFB, MA. The following are the basic requirements that the Government expects of the PICS. 1. PICS should provide positive identification and verification of all registered users. 2. It should be able to be operated from inside a vehicle with the windows closed. 3. The verification process time should at least support the current throughput of 6 vehicles per minute. 4. PICS should operate in all weather conditions. 5. The size and weight of the PICS hand-held unit should allow it to be stored in a standard shirt or pants pocket. A size close to that of a credit card is desired. The following is the envisioned operational concept for the PICS. The PICS enrollment station will be used to encode the fingerprints of the individual onto the PICS hand-held unit. Once enrolled, the user will then utilize the PICS hand-held unit to authenticate their identity against a central database of authorized personnel at entry points where the PICS reader is installed. It is the intent of the Government to conduct a full and open competition for a development effort to produce PICS for the lowest possible production cost for the system. The production cost of the PICS hand-held unit should not exceed $50 per unit threshold ($40 objective) for an annual production increment of 100,000 units. Specifically for this effort, the Government is looking for a minimum of 200 pre-production prototype hand-held PICS units, two PICS readers and two PICS enrollment stations. The contractor will install and support a three-month throughput test of the PICS at Hanscom AFB, MA. Units proposed should be of a design ready for immediate mass production. Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. The PICS Request For Proposal (RFP) is tentatively scheduled to be released within 60 days of this notice. Offerors will be provided 30 days to respond to the RFP upon issuance. Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted. RFP requests will be accepted through the Contract Specialist via e-mail only. Respondents must specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Interested Contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System (CCR). Interested contractors should ensure any potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest have been, or are in the process of being, mitigated to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. This Notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, (SPAWARSYSCEN) San Diego, in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) and DoD, is seeking proposals (technical and cost) for research and development in the following areas: (1) microelectronics, (2) micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and/or (3) photonics technology. Proposals for research and development that will support the mission of MTO to develop, demonstrate and transition the key solid state technologies that enable dominant system concepts and capabilities for the Department of Defense are specifically included.  Within its mission are presently four major thrust areas: Pushing the limits of scaling and integration, spectral exploitation and sensor dominance, systems that intelligently interact with the environment, and tools that enable scaleable and affordable access to leading edge components. Examples of areas that fall within the MTO mission might include heterogeneous integration across the three areas above to achieve complex multifunctional systems capabilities in chip-scale packages.  Sensors/emitters, processors, power sources, clocks, etc., including those that might be designed to operate under difficult conditions are all possible areas of interest.  Chips that dynamically adapt to their environment, intelligent chips that filter sensor input from the outside world, or network centric enabling components are also representative of these areas of interest.  All of the above examples are expected to further MTO's goal of developing important enabling technologies for the DoD.  Proposed efforts should offer the potential for a significant impact on the current technology and have bearing on issues confronting our Defense and National Security.  New technologies and approaches to these issues are particularly encouraged.  Additional information on the programs and interests within MTO is available within the DARPA MTO web site (http://www.darpa.mil/mto).  This announcement will be open through 06 January 2006.   Awards may be made at any time throughout this period.  Such awards will depend upon evaluations described below and availability of funds.  The Government further reserves the right to issue contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions. Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a peer and/or scientific review. The full set of evaluation criteria (listed in order of importance) are as follows: (1) Overall scientific or technical merits of the proposal; (2) potential transition to Department of Defense systems; (3) availability of funds; (4) the Offeror's capabilities, past performance, plan of execution, and facilities; (5) realism of the proposed cost. Proposers are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis/white paper, up to seven pages, inclusive of cover page, as the initial submission. A cover sheet is to be included as the front page with the following information included (1) BAA number; (2) Identify which primary technical area(s) (microelectronics, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and/or photonics technology) this submission is related to, (3) Lead Organization Submitting Proposal; (4) Type of business, selected among the following categories: "LARGE BUSINESS," "SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS," "OTHER SMALL BUSINESS," HBCU," "MI," OTHER EDUCATIONAL," or "OTHER NONPROFIT" (5) Contractor's reference number (if any); (6) Other team members (if applicable) and type of business for each; (7) Proposal title; (8) Technical point of contact to include salutation, last name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available,), electronic mail (if available); (9) Administrative point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), electronic mail (if available), total funds requested, and the amount of cost-share (if any); and Date proposal was prepared. The body of the synopsis should include a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. The initial submission (white paper or full proposal) will be evaluated using a reduced set of evaluation criteria from the full set of evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific or technical merits of the proposal; (2) potential transition to Department of Defense systems; (3) availability of funds.  The white paper is to be submitted electronically. The URL for the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central is https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. (Note that this does not include a "www" prefix).

Consequently, the Offeror will be notified as to possible interest by the government.  Upon notification, the proposer will be requested to submit a full proposal.   Likewise the proposer will be notified if there is no interest in the proposed ideas represented in the white paper at that time. A debrief will not be available for white papers.  If requested to submit a full proposal, this also will be submitted electronically. For the full proposal, the technical volume of the proposal is limited to 50 pages (Eight and one-half by eleven inches), excluding resumes, and management/facilities information. This volume should also include a separate section of specific task/subtask statements of the proposed work so that these could be incorporated into a Government Statement of Work (SOW). It shall also provide a motivation of value and purpose (i.e. if this is successful what impact it would have to the commercial and/or military world?), a concise technical scope and or goal, a contractor statement of work, complete technical details, a schedule of anticipated milestones or checkpoints, discussions of risks, and discussion of related work so as to put this proposed work into context. The schedule should include the milestones and deliverables, both reports and hardware. This volume should also clearly illustrate any technical data or computer software, which will be supplied to the government with other than unlimited rights and should identify other funding agencies for which the proposal has been submitted. The cost volume should: 1) be a separate document which clearly shows the costs of each proposed task separately, by month; and 2) provide Contract Pricing proposal Cover Sheet IAW FAR Table 15-2 (located after FAR 15.408), supported by adequate breakout of cost elements and rates by month for the purpose of cost/price analysis.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for renewal of MAXIMO software license and technical support. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from MRO Software as the only known source that can meet Agency requirements.  The annual software license support and upgrades items allow the users to obtain help from MRO Software whenever needed.  Also, code upgrades (new features, improvements, corrections, etc.) are provided to the user periodically.  If this maintenance agreement was not renewed, MRO Software’s technical and maintenance support and feature enhancements would be discontinued.  Project personnel would then not have the latest software tools they need to perform their work.  MRO Software is the only known source for support for continuation of maintenance support and upgrades for the Maximo Software.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Govenrment which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 11, 2005.

<DESC>The mission of the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, is to help ensure an end to the HIV/AID epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  The purpose of the planned acquisition is to establish a Data Analysis and Coordinating Center (DACC) for the Tri-Service AIDS Clinical Consortium (TACC), hereinafter referred to as the TACC DACC.  The TACC is a multi-site, natural history study of HIV infection affecting primarily active duty U.S. military personnel and beneficiaries.  The specific objective and scope of the TACC are to address the critical research questions on the natural and treated histories of HIV infection to minimize the adverse effects of HIV on the U.S. military community.  The TACC collects medical, laboratory, and epidemiological data from the cohort to facilitate investigations of the biology and epidemiology of HIV transmission and factors affecting disease progression, the effectiveness of therapy, and HIV treatment outcomes.  The services of a DACC are being sought to enhance the conduct of the TACC by providing expertise in epidemiology and biostatistical methods that optimize analyses of longitudinal HIV cohort data and fully utilize the network of TACC clinical sites, laboratories and specimen repositories.  A sound methodological approach to the measurement of disease incidence, prevalence, and progression, based on currently used or new surrogate markers, shall be necessary in several TACC studies where key events, such as time of HIV seroconversion, are unknown.  Additionally, the DACC will provide technical expertise in data collection, data management and quality assurance to produce a valid and reliable database for analyses.  The DACC will participate in TACC conference calls, assist in reviews of proposed concepts, and will be expected to play a dynamic role in interacting with the TACC sites to guide the science of HIV research, and in helping to establish priorities and reasonable timelines for study activities, data analyses, and publications.  Specifically, the Contractor shall carry out the following functions: 1) Establish and maintain collaborative relationships with the TACC study sites and the TACC Coordinating Team (CT); 2) Provide data cleaning, validation, and quality assurance for existing data and ongoing data collection activities; 3) Establish and maintain data security; 4) Support, train study staff, and facilitate management of cohort study operations; 5) Provide consultation in scientific study design and analytic strategies; 6) Initiate and conduct extensive cutting-edge data analyses for all retrospective, prospective, and collaborative research; 7) Consult in the design and analyses of data from clinical trials conducted within the cohort; 8) Provide data summaries for required scientific reports and presentations; 9) Document all data interactions, cleaning procedures, and analytic programs; and 10) Provide a transition of all data and documentation at the conclusion of the contract.  The TACC DACC shall establish and administer efficient, reliable and responsive system for electronic communication among TACC clinical sites, NIAID Project Officer, and the TACC CT and for the collection, management, integration, quality assurance and reporting of study data.  Offerors should demonstrate expertise in HIV longitudinal cohort study design, in the implementation and monitoring of longitudinal data collection, in statistical analyses of longitudinal data, in managerial ability to achieve delivery or performance requirements, and in the successful development and implementation of computerized databases and laboratory data management systems.  It is anticipated that a single cost-reimbursement contract will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about November 15, 2005.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about January 21, 2005, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement, which is solely at the discretion of the OCC.  Any written response should include full costing information, as well as descriptive literature containing sufficient technical documentation to establish a bonafide capacity to meet the requirement.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for professional economic services to assist it in representing the “consumer interests” of Federal Executive Agencies (FEAs) at telecommunications proceedings conducted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), State Public Utility Commissions (PUCs) (the term PUC also refers to organizations conducting state government’s telecommunications proceedings under a different name such as State Corporation Commission, Public Service Commission, etc.), and other judicial and administrative forums.  In addition to this, professional economic services are needed to assist FEAs in matters that require expert knowledge of the telecommunications industry and in matters that require expert knowledge of the FCC’s and the State PUCs’ regulation of the telecommunications industry.  This telecommunications assistance for the FCC and State PUCs will include, but will not be limited to: (i) research and analysis of tariff filings, investigations and proceedings affecting telecommunication rates, (ii) development and presentation of telecommunication material to judicial and administrative forums, (iii) evaluation of telecommunication proceedings, and (iv) investigation and study of the prices for telecommunication services.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about January 25, 2005.  The Government anticipates receipt of offeror proposals approximately thirty days (30) calendar days after issuance of the Request for Proposals.  The solicitation (Request for Proposal TQD-RH-05-0001) will be posted on the GSA Fedbizopps World Wide Web (www) at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about January 25, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) intends to issue a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) not to exceed $75,000 for Information Technology (IT) on site training as described below.  Proposals are being requested by January 10.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

Orders will be placed against this BPA via the U.S. Department of Labor Training Authorization and Evaluation Form DL 1-101.  The vendor will provide the BLS with the following training as required:  

    Introduction to Programming Concepts Using SAS Software:  
This two-day beginner’s course teaches you how to plan and write simple SAS programs to solve common data analysis problems.  Workshops are included to provide practice in running and debugging those programs in an interactive SAS session.  The course highlights reading input data, creating simple list reports, creating simple summary reports, defining new data columns, and executing code conditionally.  

    SAS Programming I: Essentials:  
This is a three-day foundation course that teaches you how to write SAS programs to accomplish typical data-processing tasks. It focuses on the following key areas: reading raw data files and SAS data sets and writing the results to SAS data sets; subsetting data; combining multiple SAS files; creating SAS variables and recoding data values; and creating listing, HTML, and summary reports. This course builds on the concepts and skills presented in the Introduction to Programming Concepts Using SAS Software course. However, students who have some programming experience may choose this course as a starting point.  

    SAS Programming II: Manipulating Data With the Data Step:  
This three-day course focuses on how to manage SAS data set input and output, work with different data types, and manipulate data.  This course builds on the concepts presented in the SAS Programming I: Essentials course and is not recommended for beginning SAS software users.  This course focuses on using the DATA step to control SAS data set input and output, combine SAS data sets, summarize data, process data iteratively with DO loops and arrays, and perform data manipulations and transformations.  

    SQL Processing with the SAS System:  
This two-day course focuses on using SQL as a data query and manipulation tool.  You learn to use the SQL procedure as a data retrieval tool within SAS programs.  Specifically, you learn how to perform queries on data; retrieve data from multiple tables; create views, indexes, and tables; and update or delete values in existing tables and views.  Using features of the SQL procedure to debug, test, and optimize the performance of SQL queries is also discussed.  

  SAS MACRO Language:  
This two-day course focuses on the components of the SAS macro facility and how to design, write, and debug macro systems.  Emphasis is placed on understanding how programs with and without macro code are processed.  

    Processing Database and Spreadsheet Data with SAS/ACCESS Software:  
This one-day course teaches you how to read and update data in databases and spreadsheets using Version 8 SAS/ACCESS software and how to create new database tables and spreadsheets. You also learn efficiency techniques for optimizing data access performance.  

   SAS Report Writing: A Programming Approach:  
This two-day course concentrates on the REPORT procedure and also provides information on producing reports using the FORMAT, TABULATE, and MEANS procedures.  Information on producing reports with the macro facility and the DATA step is also included in this course.  You learn to create detail and summary reports, tabular reports, and use the Output Delivery System (ODS) to create HTML output.  

The BLS has three training rooms in the Postal Square Building (PSB), each of which is equipped with Dell Pentium desktop computers for up to eighteen students.  Classes will have a minimum of 8 students and the training will be conducted on-site in the PSB.  The vendor will provide all services associated with delivering quality training for system developers, analysts, computer specialists, end-users, managers, and project leaders who require a comprehensive understanding of the subject material.  The training is to provide participants with new capabilities to significantly improve the way complex systems are analyzed, designed, developed, and implemented.  Offerors must be able to document instructor qualifications and experience in presenting the training described in this announcement.  

Any questions concerning the training in this announcement must be received by 3:00 p.m. on January 4.  Proposals complete with pricing must be received by 3:00 p.m. on January 10.

Proposals are being requested by January 10.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

Orders will be placed against this BPA via the U.S. Department of Labor Training Authorization and Evaluation Form DL 1-101.  The vendor will provide the BLS with the following training as required:  

  <>  Beginning Java Objects:  
This course represents an important first step for anyone who wishes to become proficient with an object-oriented programming language in general and the Java language in particular.  The goals of this course are to:  
  - Make students comfortable with fundamental object-oriented (OO) terminology and concepts.
  - To serve as the proper grounding for learning an object-oriented programming language (OOPL) such as Java.
  - Provide an introduction to core Java language syntax.
  - Enable students to read and understand simple Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams.
  - Illustrate the basics of how such a UML class diagram is translated into a working software application – a Java application, to be specific.

  <>  Deploying Java Objects:  
This course, intended as a sequel to the Beginning Java Objects course, builds upon the concepts taught in the Beginning Java Objects to illustrate how a command line driven application (such as the banking application built by students through lab exercise in the first course) can be rounded out into an “industrial strength” application employing a graphical user interface (GUI) front end and a means of persisting data.  Upon completion of this course the participant will be able to accomplish the following:  
  - With respect to data persistence, students will learn how to store and retrieve data from text files, and are introduced conceptually to the use of the JDBC API for accessing relational databases.
  - With respect to GUI technology, the course teaches students how to develop:  a stand-alone Java application using the Swing API and a Web deployed application consisting of a Java servlet back-end generating an HTML front end.
  - Students are also introduced conceptually to the use of applets, Java Server Pages (JSPs), and Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) in deploying web based, Java enabled application.

The BLS has three training rooms in the Postal Square Building (PSB), each of which is equipped with Dell Pentium desktop computers for up to eighteen students.

TO:		Prospective Proposers

RE:	Lithuania: Klaipeda Port Security Technical Assistance
		Reference No. 0470048A

SUBJECT:	Amendment to the Request for Proposals

DATE:	Thursday, January 6, 2005

This announcement serves to inform prospective proposers on the above-referenced project about amendments to the subject Request for Proposals (RFP).

Amendment No. 2:  The deadline for the submissions of proposals has been extended.  Proposals should be submitted in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. Local Time– (GMT+2), January 31, 2005.
 
Amendment No. 3:  The following supplemental background information is provided for clarification of Annex 5 Terms of Reference in the RFP.   

The following question has arisen during the RFP process, which requires clarification.   Are the port security documents available in English?

Answer: All port security documents are in the Lithuanian language only.

Further clarification:  There will be little need to translate the security response plan documents for the Port of Klaipeda.  Most security response procedures are classified and will not be released to the selected Contractor to perform this study.  However, please note that Task 1 is a review of the PHYSICAL security systems.  The procedures for security (checking passes, who is allowed to enter, etc.) should be everyday instructions that the personnel could explain with perhaps selective translations, as required.

This task does not require a rewrite of the security risk assessment, but a review of what should be adequate under ISPS.  The terms of reference does not include developing security response plans.  If the selected Contractor finds additional security measures are warranted and installed, then the terminals and/or the Port will have to revise their security response plans.

Task 2 is to work along with the Port in developing security equipment and measures for the Malku Bay container terminals.  This information is in flux and is still being developed by the Port.  Any outlines currently available can be provided or described to the selected Contractor with minimal translation required. 

Please be aware of the additional information provided in Amendment No. 2 and 3.

<CONTACT>Hamilton Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7043, Fax (301) 827-7101, Email hbrown@oc.fda.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) to award a contract on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) to the Drug Information Lab at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). 

CVM intends to contract with Virginia Tech to develop a standard dictionary of terms for use in drug labeling for species, claims, dosage, warnings, cautions, Adverse Drug Reactions, etc. This dictionary will help the Center to use consistent terminology for all aspects of the animal drug regulatory process.   This will become even more important in the future when CVM begins to implement Structured Product Labeling (SPL).  One premise of SPL is that all terms are drawn from a common dictionary so computers can communicate medical information without a need for human interpretation of the meaning of the text.

Virginia Tech will establish informatically-useful standardized veterinary dictionary of terms to be used by CVM for: Submission Tracking and Reporting System (STARS), Greenbook, FOI Summaries/FR Approvals of NADAs, Drug Listing, Developing/Standardizing a List of Product Label Indications/Claims, Developing/Standardizing ADEs (clinical terms and adverse event reporting), Developing/Standardizing a List of Animal Production Classes, Developing/Standardizing a List of Species, Developing/Standardizing a List of Warnings, Cautions, Contraindications Statements, Developing/Standardizing a List of Dosage Forms, Developing/Standardizing a List of others lists.

Tasks might include the following: Determine how much of the list of terms that appears in the STARS database, Drug Listing, CVM Adverse Event Reporting Dictionaries, the Greenbook, etc. is not currently available in the existing dictionaries (VEDRA and SNOMED) and work with CVM to better define these lists of terms. 
Suggest options that could provide future NADA applicants electronic access to a list that includes all of the terms from all of these sources.  Work with HL7 or other bodies in accrediting these lists for use in SPL.  This list (or group of lists), including definitions, would comprise the universe of terms acceptable for specific sections of drug labeling when CVM initiates SPL.  The list would include species, animal production classes, indications/claims, dosage, warnings, cautions, ADEs, et cetera. Determine the ideal way of creating a list of terms that would efficiently allow search capabilities to select all sources with different terminology but the same concept, e.g., weight gain, rate of weight gain, gain are different terminologies for the concept weight gain.

CVM has an existing contract with Dr. Jeff Wilcke, a professor of veterinary medical informatics and clinical pharmacology in the Drug Information Lab at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University to work on the Green Book. Virginia Tech is uniquely qualified to perform this work because they have developed and maintain the animal drug database of CVM-approved drugs and are familiar with the terminology used by FDA in the areas identified and the inconsistencies that exist.  The FDA is unaware of any other institution of similar academic or scientific stature being able to meet the requirements of the work described above.  Virginia Tech has already compared CVM¡¦s Adverse Drug Experience dictionary with VEDRA and so have the background no other institution would have in accomplishing this project.  The new project is an expansion of this work to cover terminology used in other CVM regulatory functions.  In addition, Dr. Wilcke is one of the pioneers of veterinary informatics.  He has the unique expertise to tell FDA what standardized dictionaries are available and advise us whether they might have relevant use for regulatory purposes.  Dr. Wilcke developed an internet browser for SNOMED, the Systemized Nomenclature of Human and Veterinary Medicine.  He is the AVMA liaison to the SNOMED editorial board, and currently is the administrator for the SNOMED Veterinary Forum.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Virginia Tech as the only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ). Sources interested in this requirement must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received at hbrown@oc.fda.gov within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information.  All responses received in a timely manner will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division,  Lakehurst NJ is evaluating potential lightweight aircraft tiedown devices. Aircraft tiedowns are used to secure parked aircraft to the decks of ships while holding loads derived from the inertial forces caused by ship’s motion and wind forces on the aircraft.  The existing tiedown is a self-contained hand operated device consisting of a length of chain a tensioning device, and hook ends weighing 12 pounds. The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is evaluating potential alternative tiedown devices that weigh less and may be constructed of synthetic materials.  The Government is requesting information on the availability of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) tiedown devices. The tiedowns should conform to the following salient features: (1) The tiedown shall have a working load of 10,000 lbs and be capable of withstanding an ultimate load of 14,100 lbs without failure.  (2) The assembly should be not less than 108 inches long and not weigh more than 6 lbs.  (3) The assembly should consist of synthetic rope, webbing, or chain terminated with hook ends.  (4) A tensioning mechanism shall be provided to take up slack left during initial installation and to provide pre-tension. The tensioning assembly shall be capable of being attached at any point on the assembly providing incremental length adjustment within overall tiedown length. (5) The tiedown shall be constructed so that the assembly can be manually released and automatically separated from the tensioning assembly when installed under load.   Please provide commercial pamphlets, drawings, and tiedown samples that meet the requirements listed above.  It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 31 January 2005 to Mr. Jack Murtagh, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25221B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, or by electronic mail at:  john.murtagh@navy.mil who may be reached at 732-323-2901 or fax 732-323-2359, or to Ms. Lori Bishop, by electronic mail at:  lori.bishop@navy.mil who may be reached at 732-323-4771.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure.

DESC:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR subpart 12. Solicitation number is OPM-RFQ-05-00003AMC and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation incorporates Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15. Incorporated by reference are FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.2l2-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.  Additional FAR clauses apply. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541618, Other Management Consulting Services, with a small business size standard of $6 Million. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. 

SCOPE OF PERFORMANCE:  The Center for Retirement and Insurance Service (CRIS) is a large-scale financial organization within the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Human Resources Products and Services, which administers the Civil Service and Federal Employees Retirement Systems (CSRS and FERS) programs, as well as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance Program, Long Term Care and Flexible Spending Accounts.  

Annually, OPM contracts to have a comprehensive audit to examine the agency’s financial, accounting and fiduciary activities and present its opinion on the degree to which the agency’s systems, procedures and internal controls are in place and effective. In support of the annual audit of the agency’s financial statements, the goal of this solicitation is to ascertain, through statistical sampling and cohort analysis, the degree to which errors have been made in computation of entitlement payments for the 2.4 million retirees and survivors under the CSRS and FERS. The primary objective of these studies is to present to the auditor of record a set of calculations which enable OPM to objectively support its assertion that there is no material misstatement of annuitant payments. In addition, we seek to assure the auditor of record and most importantly those receiving benefits that the long term liability for future retiree and beneficiary payments is fairly stated; further, the Trust Fund liability is not understated, enabling us to continue uninterrupted payments into the future.  Finally, OPM must report an annual estimate of Overpayments, Underpayments and Total/Improper Payments in dollars and as a proportion of annual disbursements, in the agency’s Performance and Accountability Report (PAR).

EVALUATION OF OFFERS 

We will evaluate your proposal on the basis of your response to the technical factors listed below and your pricing.

This is a Best Value solicitation.  Technical merit is significantly more important than price.  We reserve the right to award a contract to a technically superior contractor who is higher in price.  When Technical Proposals are evaluated as essentially equal, price may become the deciding factor.  

Technical factors – These are the technical factors we will evaluate.  They are in descending order of importance.  The subfactors within Items A and B are also of equal importance. 

A.	Technical Approach: We will evaluate proposals based on the degree to which the offeror demonstrates an ability to provide the statistical support needed to meet the scope and objectives of the RFQ and an overall understanding of CSRS / FERS retirement benefits administration within the stated constraints.  This factor includes the offeror’s understanding of the RFQ as well as the suitability of the offeror’s approach to meeting our objectives.  We will evaluate proposals based on the subfactors below.  

	Product or Service Quality-availability to comply with the requirements stated this RFQ, the quality of those features, and degree to which the offeror’s auditing service capabilities meet our needs as specified in this Request for Quotation (RFQ).

	Qualifications/Staffing- the technical strength and expertise of the resources presented by the offeror and the offeror’s ability to deliver quality staff (if needed) over the life of the Blanket Purchase Agreement.  

B.	Past Performance – We will evaluate past performance of the offeror to provide insight into each offeror’s ability to meet our objectives base on actual experience providing similar, related services.  Past performance providing defined retirement benefits services of similar scope (to our needs) will be a major component of past performance.  

	Product or Service Quality:  compliance with contract requirements- technical excellence.
	
	Timeliness of Performance:  meet interim milestones, where applicable – completed on time – reliable- responsive to technical direction, flexible to accelerated reporting requirements in future cycles.
	
	Cost Control:  within budget – current and accurate billing- relation of actual to estimated cost.
	
	Customer Satisfaction: Satisfaction of end users with the vendor’s service. CRIS’ QAG is the primary customer.
	
	
C.	Price Evaluation Factors
We will evaluate your pricing proposal, not only to determine whether the price is reasonable, but also to determine your understanding of the scope of work and your ability to meet the objectives and scope of this RFQ.  The Price Proposal will be evaluated for the base year and all option years. We will evaluate your pricing proposal (for all pricing scenarios) for the base period and all option years to determine completeness (acceptability and validity of the pricing).  To assist in determining reasonableness, evaluation of an offeror's proposal may include verification of the rates proposed.

CENTRIFUGAL CHILLER
PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM


BACKGROUND

A.	The Ecosystems Research Division is located in a three story building with a gross square footage of approximately 57,000 square feet.  This building includes administrative, laboratories and offices in the first, second and basement floors.  Air conditioning is provided by means of two centrifugal McQuay chillers with a capacity of 150 tons each.

B.	The McQuay Model PEH Centrifugal Water Chillers are complete, self-contained, automatically controlled water chilling units.  Each unit contains one compressor connected to a condenser and an evaporator.  The standard chillers use refrigerant 134a, to reduce the size and weight of the package and since they operate at a positive pressure over the entire operation range, no purge system is required.

C.	The purpose of this agreement is to establish a Centrifugal Chiller Preventive Maintenance Program, covering both predictive maintenance and air conditioning, which will provide the required service to assure the continued and satisfactory operation of the chillers.

GENERAL

A.

<DESC>The referenced combined synopsis/solicitation (OPM-RFQ-05-00003AMC)is hereby amended to address questions and answers, and to incorporate the following sections:  Place of Performance, Government-Furnished Facilities and Equipment, Travel, Security, and Section 508 Compliance.  

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q:	No contractor employees shall solicit new business at OPM or its facilities while performing work under this contract.” Can you clarify this statement further?
A:	While working on a contract at OPM or its facilities, neither the contractor nor its employees can solicit or market for any new business.  However, they are welcome to respond to any OPM solicitation.

Q:	 For example, we currently have contracts with OPM both as a prime contractor and as a subcontractor. Would this disqualify us from bidding on this solicitation? What is the rationale for the requirement? Could certain restrictions be put in place to allow current OPM contractors to bid on this?
A:	No, a contractor can have one or more contracts for OPM as long as it doesn’t create an organizational conflict of interest. (OCI) (FAR 9.5).

Q:	Another statement in the solicitation is: “While not required, it is preferable that the contractor have a basic familiarity of federal retirement benefits administration, processes, and systems used to calculate retirement and survivor annuities.”  Why is knowledge of the federal retirement program not required? It would seem that in order to examine the accuracy of retirement annuity payments, knowledge of federal retirement should be a requirement, not just preferred.
A:	We do not feel detailed knowledge of the Retirement Benefits Administration is a prerequisite to successfully provide the services solicited.

Q:	Is the referenced solicitation a small business set-aside?
A:	Yes

Q: 	Is the $6 million annual sales the upper limit for such “small business”?
A:	The $6 million annual sales upper limit is the total dollar amount of sales over three fiscal year period (FAR 19.101 (v) (1)). 

Q:	Is there an incumbent currently performing the work? 
A:	Yes, This proposal was announced due to the expiration of an existing Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  Dr Francis Ponti held the existing BPA (BPA030200004).

Q:	 If an incumbent does exist, what has been the level of effort expended, and what was the overall cost to the government for the work? 
A:	CRIS was billed approx 20 hrs in each of the last two years for statistical services.

Q:	The draft solicitation indicates that the hours are not to exceed 60 in the base or option years.  Has this work been performed expending 60 hours or less in the past? 
A:	Yes – see response to #2.

Q:	Given the broad scope of the SOW and open ended nature of many of the tasks listed, would OPM be open to proposals that exceeded 60 hours? 
A:	We believe our need for the services listed in the RFP can be met within the 60hr guideline noted within the RFP.

Q:	Does a database already exist from which the sample will be drawn?  If so, what form is it in (e.g., flat files, MS Excel, MS Access, SAS, etc.)? 
A:	The database is a ‘snapshot’ of the annuity roll, which our Benefits Systems Group manages.  Once provided with pertinent parameters they provide CRIS/QAG will us with the sample in MS Excel format.

Q:	How much data preparation does OPM expect will be necessary for completion of the tasks listed?  In other words, can the contractor expect to work from well structured data to perform the analysis, or should they expect a significant amount of effort to be expended on data extracts and transformations in order to perform the sampling and analysis listed in the required tasks? 
A:	CRIS has historical records, spreadsheets and analyses providing a structured foundation for future years’ activity.  We are open to, and may request variances in, the approach previously used, to improve the process—or as requirements change.

Q:	What limits will be placed on the “Ad Hoc analyses and requests from CRIS management”?
A:	CRIS expects the resource requirements for “Ad Hoc analyses and requests from CRIS management” to be within the NTE 60 hr guideline noted within the RFP.

6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

USTDA intends to commission a DM consultant to travel to Russia and Ukraine to examine projects relating to coal bed methane (CBM) and coalmine methane (CMM).  

Russia and Ukraine are among the world’s top coal producers, with Russia possessing the world’s largest coal reserves.  Kuzbass, Russia’s largest and most important coal-producing region, has coal reserves estimated to be on the order of 14.5 billion tons.  Kuzbass also has some of the world’s largest reserves of CBM/CMM, most of which is currently vented directly into the atmosphere.  Coalmines in Russia's smaller Pechora Basin have been successfully recovering and using CMM for many years in boilers at the mines.  With adequate capital investment, CBM/CMM projects in Kuzbass could be highly successful, given the size of the methane resource and the market for clean energy.  The same can be said for Ukraine; according to a recent study, 95% of the methane produced from Ukrainian coalmines is vented into the atmosphere directly, rather than used as an energy source.

In either country, venting this clean and burnable gas into the atmosphere results in economic loss, a tremendous waste of energy and harm to the environment, as methane is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Historically, methane was vented into the atmosphere to reduce the risk of explosions and to increase mine productivity.  As methane extraction and utilization technologies became more advanced, companies began to recognize that the methane produced represented a new revenue source for the mine.  According to the EPA, the utilization of methane produced from degasification systems increased over 300% in the ten-year period from 1990-2000.  The ability to utilize methane produced from degasification systems has continued to grow due to advances in gas processing and power generation technologies.  Furthermore, reduced methane/GHG emissions can be sold as carbon credits to Kyoto Protocol participants.  

In addition to the numerous commercial incentives, there are serious environmental and mine safety benefits to be had by Russia and Ukraine in promoting CBM/CMM recovery programs.  Methane is a potent GHG and is one of the key gases targeted for reduction under the Kyoto Protocol.  As a recent signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, Russia will face more pressure to lower GHG levels throughout the country.  In terms of safety, Ukraine has the world’s highest coal industry death rate, more than 100 times that of U.S. coalmines.  Each year, hundreds of coal miners are killed in Ukrainian mines, mostly due to methane-related explosions and fires.

The selected DM consultant will be expected to travel to Kyiv and the Donbass region in Ukraine, as well as Moscow and the Kuzbass region in Russia to meet with relevant project contacts, government officials, U.S. companies and U.S. Embassy officials.  The consultant will review existing proposals, evaluate the investment climate in these methane-rich regions of Russia and Ukraine, and scope out other potential projects eligible for USTDA funding.
