<DESC>The ITEC4 anticipates the issuance of a draft Request for Proposals (RFP) W91QUZ-09-R-0003 for commercially produced Automatic Identification Technology - IV (AIT-IV) to support the DoD, the Coast Guard, contractor purchases in support of DoD, foreign military sales and other Federal Agencies.  The objectives of AIT-IV are to provide a state-of-the-art, common, integrated structure for logistics tracking, locating, and monitoring of assets and processes.  In addition, data collection, storage information, information processing, and transmission of AIT data will greatly enhance systems within Department of Defense (DoD), United States Coast Guard, and other Federal Agencies.  AIT technologies will provide standardization and interoperability among Government users of AIT components purchased from this contract. for state-of-the-art, commercial items needed for automatic identification, data collection, keyless data entry, data processing, data storage, data retrieval, data transmission, and the tracking of assets, including the use of Radio Frequency (RF) technology for users throughout Department of Defense (DoD), Coast Guard (CG), contractor purchases in support of DoD, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and other Federal Agencies.  The Government requires software for development (libraries, device drivers, application programming interfaces, and software development tool kits), equipment operating systems, radio frequency transaction management (RF engines), bar code label and form generation, application generation software, application software development kits, and communications.  Associated technical engineering services (and turn-key integration services, systems integration, software development, surveys and installations), instruction and training, warranty, maintenance, documentation, and program management are required. The technologies required by the Government encompass bar code symbologies, contact or touch memory, direct thermal and thermal transfer printing, radio frequency data communications, and future technologies as they are developed.  These future technologies include, but are not limited to, biometrics, systems using satellite communications to relay data and provide position information, cellular telephony, voice recognition, smart labels (combined bar code label and RF transponder), IUID marking equipment, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies.  The Government requires equipment with these technologies to support both current and future requirements.  The requirements are for both civilian and military operations worldwide.  The Government requires equipment compliant with open systems standards as described in the Defense Information Standards Registry (DISR). The Government is contemplating multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed price contracts in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government anticipates that the acquisition will result in up to three awards.  The Government anticipates the release date of the draft RFP to the Army Single Face to Industry site https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ on or about 13 November 2008 with questions/comments regarding the solicitation due approximately on/about 28 November 2008 after issuance.

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska, intends to negotiate directly on a sole-source basis with State of Alaska, Alaska Department of Fish and Game for a project related to collection of Sitka Black Tail harvest information and reporting.  The details of the project scope and deliverables are as follows:
Title:  Results of Sitka black-tailed deer hunter harvest in Game Management Unit 8 for the 2008-09 regulatory year.
Background: Deer are widely sought by subsistence and sport hunters in Game Management Unit (GMU) 8, distribution of which encompasses the Kodiak Archipelago, including Kodiak Refuge.  This species is the primary source of game meat to archipelago residents and deer hunting has been the primary public use of the Refuge during late fall-early winter for the past 25 years.  Within the Refuge, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service share responsibilities for management of deer hunting.  Whereas the Department is responsible for management of recreational sport hunting under state regulations, the Service is responsible for management of subsistence hunting under federal subsistence regulations.
Since 1980, the Department has systematically surveyed deer hunters to determine status and trend in harvest composition (age/sex ratios), hunter effort, and hunter residency associated with the annual GMU 8 sport and subsistence deer hunting.  The survey process has consisted of following steps.  After the hunting season ends, the Department mails a standard survey form to a randomized sample of hunters who purchased deer harvest tickets for GMU 8 in the previous regulatory year.  Hunters selected for survey are requested to address a series of general and specific questions including level of effort, month of hunt, number of harvest area, days hunted, age and sex of deer harvested, and method of transportation.  Completed forms returned by hunters are entered into a database, data is subject to standard analyses, results are interpreted, and findings are issued in meetings and reports.  
Survey results have been the primary tool used to manage deer populations and deer hunting activity on and off Kodiak Refuge.  Up until 2003, all survey costs, including those associated with survey of the January segment of the federal subsistence harvest, were paid for by the Department.  Due to budget cutbacks, the Department decided to discontinue the survey in regulatory year 2004-05.  Absent a survey, the Refuge and Department's management of deer would suffer and public credibility of agencies would diminish.  
Given the need of both agencies to maintain the harvest survey, the Refuge proposed to share survey costs with the Department.  This contract would provide the Department with funds in partial support of survey completion.  In turn, the Department has agreed to combine Refuge funds with its own to complete the survey.   
Work Description:  The scope of work under this contract is limited to survey of hunters who obtained deer harvest tickets in GMU 8 during the 2008-09 deer hunting season (August 1, 2008 to January 31, 2009).  The Department shall execute the survey using the recently revised (2005) version of the questionnaire form. (Specifically, this revision item distinguishes whether the hunter hunted on, and harvested deer from, federal land.)  To improve accuracy of participant reporting, the Department shall update the map it provides survey participants along with the survey form.  This map update shall more clearly depict the area of federal land within Game Management Unit 8.  Deliverables shall consist of 1) the revised map, and 2) a series of data tables that summarize survey results.  See the "Products" section below for details. 
 Products:  1.  By June 1, 2009, provide the Refuge with a summary of results of the deer harvest survey for the 2008-09 regulatory year.  Summary tables shall include analysis of harvest level, composition, and effort by management unit (federal, non-federal lands) for Game Management Unit 8.  The summary shall be transmitted in electronic format to US Fish and Wildlife Service's Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.  Electronic format shall consist of Adobe 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals to complete this work, and the government does not intend to either accept nor evaluate proposals received in response to this notice.  However, parties claiming their ability to provide the needed services may contact the contracting officer to identify their firms capacity to provide all required work and deliverables. 
Pending successful negotiations and resultant pricing, award is anticipated to be made approximately 15 days follwoing the issuance of this notice, on or about December 1, 2008.  See Numbered Note 22.

**4 Horns are already installed and are functional.
Refer to the table below for the number of each component type needed and for the locations where they are to be installed.
It is highly recommended that contractors arrange for a site survey by calling John Spangler, Facility Manager, between 7am and 3:30pm at 434-352-8987.
The components in 15 of the buildings will report to the Addressable Control Panel with Dialer and Communications Interface that is to be installed in the Visitor Center.  This new Panel will replace the existing panel, will be capable of accepting communications from the 15 out-buildings, and will have the capacity to accommodate signals from 22 intrusion system locations.  The Visitor Center Panel must be compatible with and programmed to dial out to the Appomattox Sheriff's office.   
Contractor's bid shall include all supplies, materials, components as listed in the table below, and labor to install said components.
Most work will be conducted while the park is open and visitors are present.  Installation work will not prevent visitor access and will be done in such a manner as not to endanger visitors or staff and keep interference with normal park operations and visitors to a minimum.  Labor will include the time necessary to clean up debris as each component is installed.  Any damage to park buildings resulting from installation will be repaired such that the damaged area will be in the same condition as prior to the damage.  All of the building are historic; therefore any needed repairs would have to conform with the historic fabric.  Acceptance of repairs will be by the COTR who has historic preservation expertise.
At completion of the installation, the Contractor will provide any and all literature on all the types of components installed.  Contractor will also provide hands on training for the park Maintenance Mechanic, the park Facility Manager and the park Curator.

COORDINATION
The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years and  involve projects at various stages of completion, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State and local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes, policies, and permitting processes. Additionally, the A/E will need to have direct contact with planning and advisory agencies of the federal government such as CFA and NCPC and provide supporting materials and documentation as required to obtain approval from these agencies for the NPS projects under contract.      
SPECIALIZED SERVICES
In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the NPS occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor. Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  All task orders will be issued to the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner.  The NPS does not allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub-consultant's services.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design controlactivity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique designcapability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualifiedsource(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). Theapproved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technicaldata that are not economically available to the Government, and the data orknowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.

If your request for source approval is currently beingevaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter whichforwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail toprovide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previoussubmission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not beconsidered for award under this solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State, Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) Program has a requirement to enhance the capacity of qualified African nations to participate in internationally mandated peace support operations (PSO) and contingency operations in Africa.  This purpose is in accordance with U.S. policy objectives supporting the United Nations, the African Union, African Regional Economic Communities, the African Standby Force concept and individual troop contributing countries.  The ACOTA Program will pursue its purpose of enhancing the PSO and contingency operations capacities of selected African nations in three ways.  First, the ACOTA Program will directly train and equip African peacekeepers, peacekeeping and contingency operations contingents, and associated staffs at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels.  Second, the ACOTA Program will train African PSO trainers so as to enable African partners to indigenously conduct PSO training over the long term with minimal outside assistance.  Third, the ACOTA Program will sustain an effort over the long term to mentor and assist indigenous PSO training, provide updated instructor cadre refreshment training, provide limited equipping for training purposes, and upgrade training facilities. One important feature of the ACOTA Program is that the training and equipping programs for each African partner nation are uniquely tailored to meet that nations special training, equipment and infrastructure needs, peacekeeping deployment plans, mission specificity, and national, regional and African Standby Force (ASF) requirements.  The uniquely tailored training and equipping programs are achieved through close collaboration with the partner nations planners, officials and leadership.  The contractors program manager and one other permanent official assigned to the contractors ACOTA program shall have a current Secret security clearance.  All other contractor personnel performing the specific work described in this statement of work are not required to possess a security clearance.  The contractor shall maintain the capability to purchase, store, pack and transport from CONUS to the training location, all equipment necessary to support each training activity.  The Department of State intends to award three or more IDIQ training contracts by conducting an unrestricted/partial set-aside, full and open competition, with one award set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.  We anticipate a one year contract with four option years.  It is planned that the solicitation will be issued on FedBizOpps not sooner than 15 days after posting of this notice.  Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Government plans to acquire an MRAP All-Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV).  The M-ATV is a lighter, off-road, and more maneuverable vehicle that incorporates current MRAP level protection.  The M-ATV will require effectiveness in an off-road mission profile.  The vehicle will include EFP and RPG protection (integral or removable kit). The M-ATV will maximize both protection levels and off-road mobility & maneuverability attributes, and must balance the effects of size and weight while attempting to achieve the stated requirements.  The M-ATV acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Joint MRAP Vehicle Program.  An NDI solution for the M-ATV is sought; we are responding to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS).<BR><BR>Offerors must be prepared to timely deliver five test vehicles.    The government will purchase (at approximately 90 days after RFP release) the first two of the five representative test vehicles from each offeror that passes the proposal entrance criteria.  Following vehicle test and evaluation, approximately 120 days after RFP release, the government plans to award up to 5 IDIQ contracts. Offerors whose proposals and vehicles pass the entrance criteria will be offered an opportunity to provide a final proposal revision prior to the award. Awardees must deliver the three additional test vehicles within three business days of contract award.  At the completion of testing, the government plans to select from the IDIQ contractors a single M-ATV producer but may, at its discretion, place production orders with multiple IDIQ producers.  <BR><BR>There is a quantity range required from 372 to the most probable M-ATV production quantity of 2,080 up to a maximum of 10,000.  The RFP will also require pricing for a range of monthly delivery rates from 100 to 1,000.  These production quantity estimates are subject to availability of funding.  The resulting IDIQ contract(s) will include associated initial spare parts and ancillary requirements.  As soon as feasible, the government will post a draft acquisition summary with the anticipated schedule, and other documents on the M-ATV web page.  An RFP is planned to be issued before 1 December. URL: http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/mrap/mrap.htm <BR>Potential offerors are encouraged to frequently review the website often for updates. <BR><BR>

<DESC>This requirement was previously synopsized under Solicitation NumberW15QKN-08-R-0353. 
The U.S Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ in support of the Product Manager, Mortar Systems, anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) in December 2008 for the manufacturing and/or delivery of Basic Issue Items, and Direct Support Tools for the M224 60mm Mortar Systems, M252 81mm and M120 120mm Mortar Systems.  The anticipated RFP will be a five (5) year Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) on a Firm Fixed price (FFP) basis.  The initial order will consist of a quantity of approximately 49 each BII and 100 each organizational tool sets for the 60mm mortar systems, 71 each BII and 38 organizational tool sets for the 81mm mortar systems and 97 each BII and 31 each organizational tool sets for the 120mm mortar systems with four options.  This contractual action will rely on a system integrator capable of making or buying the components comprising the sets of mortar support equipment.  This equipment is to be manufactured, inspected, assembled, packaged, and shipped in accordance with Government TDPs and applicable contract requirements. Potential sources should have a Quality System equivalent to ISO 9000:2000, experience in qualifying and managing vendors and prior contract experience with efforts of similar complexity.  This contract will require the delivery of Tritium bearing components.  Producers and handlers for the M67 Sight Units, Tritium Lamps and Range Indicators will require NRC Certification.  Reducing the number of times these tritium bearing devices are handled can reduce certification needs.  The anticipated contract will require the successful completion of first article inspections.  The First Article samples will be required to be submitted to the Government five months after contract award.  The government intends to issue this solicitation as a Small Business Set Aside (SBSA).  A listing of all individual items within the 60mm, 81mm and 120mm Basic Issue Item kits, the corresponding organizational tool kits as well as the 81mm Direct support tool kit is available upon request by emailing edward.gelpke@us.army.mil.

All interested parties will also be required to submit an approved DD Form 2345 Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. The DD Form 2345 can be obtained at:  www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp.  At the top of the website page, open library on the blue bar.  Scroll down to the Other Forms section on the page and double click on DD 2345.  The above referenced TDP will not be released until a signed and approved DD Form 2345 is received along with the Non-Disclosure Form.  To request a Non-Disclosure form please submit request to:  The U.S. Army, JM&L LCMC Acquisition Center, Ray Gelpke, Contract Specialist, edward.gelpke@us.army.mil.

All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes ! and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the offi! cial version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

This area extends from the northern California border down to and including the counties of Monterey, Kings, Tulare and Inyo.  Construction activities may occur in operating mail-handling facilities possibly with 24 hour, seven days a week operations, and in such case, construction activities must not interfere with postal operations.  Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of experience, must have completed a minimum of three comparable projects in the area over the past five years, must hold a current State of California contractors license or have an application for said license on file with the state license board, must meet bonding, computer and other requirements as specified in the prequalification package.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as new construction and repair and alteration projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities and a construction cost of $5,000,000.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  comparable experience (60 points); non-comparable experience (40 points); organization (30 points); safety (20 points).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  background information, eligibility, certification and affirmation, financial capability, bonding information.  Contractors placed on the prequalified list will be requested to submit a management plan and cost proposal that will be project specific.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.

(2) Prequalify additional firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be constructed, expanded, repaired, or altered.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition.  (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  Qualification Statement packages may be obtained through this announcement or by sending an email request to grace.b.zipagan@usps.gov, or nancy.young@usps.gov.

<DESC><p>ASOS All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauges RFI</p>
<p>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) Product Improvement Program intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302 Other Than Full and Open Competition with National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Request for sole source is to support collection and analysis of data in order to develop a transfer algorithm to improve reporting accuracy of the ASOS All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauges (AWPAG) during periods of blowing precipitation. This effort will be conducted for approximately one year.The ASOS AWPAG is designed to accurately measure freezing and frozen precipitation in winter. A continuing concern with AWPAG performance is undercatch in wind driven snow conditions. Because the most common precipitation gauge installation has the gauge orifice elevated above ground level where it is impacted by airflow due to blowing wind. The resulting turbulence deflects falling hydrometeors, with the greatest effect being on low water content snow particles. This issue can be addressed by adding a wind screen of sufficient size to disburse the effects of blowing wind, however there is a practical limit to the size and resulting cost in installing large and expensive wind shields. The size can be a particular problem at airports where most NWS ASOSs are installed. A more practical approach is to develop a mathematical adjustment to the AWPAG report to account for wind effects. The approach to developing such an algorithm is to install a freestanding production AWPAG in close proximity to an AWPAG which is located inside a Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) shield, a large wooden structure that is designed to optimize gauge catch to very close to the true catch. The ratio of AWPAG catch to DFIR catch can be correlated to wind speed and possibly other environmental factors to obtain a transfer function. While NWS has installed DFIRs in its testbed at Sterling, VA and its Winter Test Facility in Johnstown, PA, there is a requirement to collect performance data in a region where dry snows accompanied by strong wind are more common than at these two sites. The vendor must provide a facility having one or more existing DFIRs which meets this climatology requirement, and who has extensive additional precipitation measurement capabilities as well as extensive field test sensor and data acquisition capabilities. This facility must be instrumented such that accurate wind speed and direction, present weather and ambient temperature data is available. The NWS will be given access to all data collected that might be necessary or desirable for use in transfer function development. This may include but is not necessarily limited to:<br />&bull; Facility anemometer wind speed and direction at orifice and other heights <br />&bull; Measurements from other precipitation gauges installed in the testbed<br />&bull; Ambient temperature and dew point temperature valuesThis data would be made available by internet (e.g. ftp) such that NWS could download data daily. The vendor will assist in formulation and verification of the mathematical transfer function resulting from this effort.<br />The goal of this task is to develop an AWPAG transfer function, a mathematical relationship of the catch ratio of the AWPAG with it's ASOS shield configuration to the catch of a precipitation gauge inside a Double Fence Intercomparison Reference as described in the WMO Report No. 67 (WMO/TD - No. 872,1998) WMO SOLID PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENT INTERCOMPARISON FINAL REPORT by B.E. Goodison and P.Y.T. Louie and D. Yang.Offerors who believe they can satisfy the requirement must demonstrate their ability in writing. All written response must include a written narrative statement of capability, facility description, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than ten (10) days after publication to this synopsis to Joyce.Dickerson@noaa.gov or fax 301-713-1024. No telephone requests will be honored. Award will be made under commercial simplified acquisition procedures, FAR Subpart 12.</p>
<p>&nbsp;ASOS All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauges SOW</p>
<p>Statement of Work<br />for installing an Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauge (AWPAG)<br />within a Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) to develop a Transfer AlgorithmBackground:The Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) is the primary observing system for the National Weather Service (NWS). ASOS is configured to provide a complete automated aviation observation in support of flight operations at over 1000 airports throughout the U.S. About 330 of these ASOSs are also NWS first order stations for the additional purpose of providing accurate long term climate records. These stations have been upgraded with enhanced precipitation measurement capability. Specifically the All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauge (AWPAG) is designed to accurately measure freezing and frozen precipitation in winter. It has replaced the heated tipping bucket, which is not designed to measure winter precipitation. One continuing concern with the new AWPAG gauge is the well known problem of undercatch in wind driven snow conditions. Most precipitation gauges suffer from this problem because the orifice must be elevated above ground level with wind being deflected around and over the orifice. Turbulence deflects falling hydrometeors, with the greatest effect being on lighter, slow falling, snow particles. One attempt at solving the undercatch problem is to add shielding to the gauge to reduce the wind speed and turbulence near the gauge orifice and thereby increase the snow that falls into the gauge. While many shields have been developed, there is a practical limit to the size and resulting cost in installing large and expensive wind shields. The size can be a particular problem at airports where most NWS ASOSs are installed. Airports limit the space that is occupied by ASOS and AWPAGs on ASOS are mounted on a rail where the distance between sensors is about ten feet.Over the last three years, the NWS has worked with the AWPAG manufacturer, Ott GMBH, to improve the catch efficiency, by attaching an eight foot diameter Alter style shield to their standard Tretyakov style shield.While this has been proven to significantly improve catch, a longer term objective is to develop a transfer function for the AWPAG with Alter shield. The approach is to install the AWPAG with the new shield near a gauge inside a Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) shield, a large wooden structure that is designed to optimize gauge catch to very close to the true catch. The ratio of AWPAG catch to DFIR catch can be correlated to wind speed and possibly other environmental factors to obtain the so-called transfer function (described below). While NWS has installed DFIRs in its testbed at Sterling, VA and its Winter Test Facility in Johnstown, PA, it also needs to collect transfer function data in a region where dry snows accompanied by strong wind are more common than at Sterling or Johnstown. The Government is seeking a contractor and facility which meets this requirement and currently has a gauge inside a DFIR, who has extensive additional precipitation measurement capabilities as well as extensive field test sensor and data acquisition capabilities.Goal:The long term goal of this task is to develop an AWPAG transfer function, a mathematical relationship of the catch ratio of the AWPAG with it's ASOS shield configuration to the catch of a precipitation gauge inside a Double Fence Intercomparison Reference as described in the WMO Report No. 67 (WMO/TD - No. 872,1998) WMO SOLID PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENT INTERCOMPARISON FINAL REPORT by B.E. Goodison and P.Y.T. Louie and D. Yang.<br />Preliminary transfer function development work has been done leading to an equation for the standard ASOS Tretyakov configuration. This is described in the conference preprint paper Development of a Transfer Function for the ASOS All-Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauge by Jennifer M. Dover presented at 13th Conference on Aviation, Range and Aerospace Meteorology (2008)<br />This equation requires knowledge of the wind speed at orifice height and ambient temperature. The speed can be measured at orifice height, or estimated by an equation that estimates orifice height wind from wind measured at a different height. To adjust gauge measurements for any wind induced bias, wind speed at gauge orifice height during the time of precipitation is required. If the wind is not measured at gauge height, then the station wind speed, which is typically located at 10 m above ground surface, can be used to estimate the wind at gauge orifice height (h) using the following formula:Uh = [log (h/z0) / (log (H/z0))] x UH where:<br />Uh wind speed at the height of the gauge orifice<br />h height (m) of gauge orifice above ground<br />z0 roughness length: 0.01 m for winter and 0.03 m for summer<br />H height (m) of the wind speed measuring instrument above ground, normally 10 m<br />UH wind speed measured at the height H above ground.Then once wind speed at orifice height is measured or estimated, an equation can be used to derive actual precipitation from measured precipitation using the transfer function. As an example, the standard Tretyakov shield transfer function equation for snow is:CR = 103.10 - 8.67 * WS + 0.30 * T Where CR is catch ratio (AWPAG catch/DFIR catch), WS = Wind Speed (m/s) at Gauge Height, and T = Air Temperature (C&ordm;) Since in an automated system there must be a way to determine if the precipitation type is snow, a precipitation identifier such as the one used on ASOS, the Light Emitting Diode Weather Identifier (LEDWI) must be incorporated.Approach:The Government proposes to provide an ASOS AWPAG gauge with the new Tretyakov/ alter shield. This will be installed in the vicinity of the large DFIR. The Government will also provide a LEDWI precipitation identifier. In addition the NWS will provide a standard ASOS anemometer, the Vaisala 425NWS, for installation at 10 meters in the vicinity of the AWPAG gauge. The AWPAG, LEDWI, and 425NWS data will be integrated into the facility's data acquisition system. For the purposes of transfer function development, the contractor will give NWS access to the precipitation measurements from the precipitation gauge that is in the large DFIR. Also NWS will be given access to any data collected that might be necessary or desireable for use in transfer function development. This may include but is not necessarily limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Facility anemometer wind speed and direction at orifice and other heights <br />&bull; Measurements from other precipitation gauges installed in the testbed<br />&bull; Ambient temperature and dew point temperature valuesThis data would be made available by internet (e.g. ftp) so that NWS could download data at least every day. As part of the arrangement, the contractor would have access to NWS AWPAG, LEDWI, and 425NWS data for to their use in any studies that they might wish to conduct. Pre- installation Activities:The Government is pursuing availability of a contractor facility capable of supporting this effort. Contractors who desire to support the task will provide the Government a proposal containing an item by item breakdown of cost to provide the infrastructure and staff to support this effort.NWS would review and determine if funds are available. NWS and the contractor will identify a suitable location for the installation of equipment Installation activities :Install AWPAG, LEDWI, and 425NWS and integrate into facility data acquisition systemContractor provides internet connectivity to permit remote download of data at NWS test facility at Sterling, VA.Post Installation activities:Contractor assist in resolution of problems with gauges such as diagnosis of problems or replacement of failed equipment.At the completion of the evaluation, assist in removal of Government furnished equipment and packing of equipment for return.</p>

<DESC>DescriptionThe U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is conducting a sources sought notice to locate business concerns for conducting safety analyses of prospective changes to air tour operating environments , initially over the Grand Canyon, and subsequently over various other U.S. National Parks for the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
Task 1. Develop Metrics Definition and Data Collection Plan: A Metrics Definition and Data Collection Plan (Plan) will be developed to ensure that there is agreement on the detail and depth of analysis and on the metrics and measurement methodologies to be used.  
Task 2.   Baseline data collection and analysis - Existing Operations This task includes the evaluation of the existing air tour operating environment and developing a reference baseline, which will be used as a basis for comparison of the proposed changes from existing conditions.  The analysis must include both off-season and peak season periods.  This task includes the following sub tasks: 
Data Collection:  The reference baseline will consist of data collected during the fall and the spring/summer periods and in accordance with the approved Data Collection Plan developed in Task 1.  
Airspace Analysis:  Conduct an overview of the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) operations and the adjacent area operational components (below FL180) of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The contractor shall conduct simulation and analyses of sector traffic volumes using TAAM and/or SIMMOD simulation tools, and an interface analysis of all itinerant traffic. Additionally, analysis of traffic, airports, Class D airspace interface, ingress and egress routes and points, and transitional route segments including airspace close to the SFRA boundary will also be conducted, as well as other tasks identified for establishing necessary baseline airspace metrics.  
Evaluation and Analysis of Human Factors:  Conduct an initial scoping evaluation of human factors in SFRA operations, pilot workload analysis, task saturation analysis, route complexity analysis, terrain feature and weather pattern analysis.  Of prime importance will be the integration of the Human Factors and Analysis Classification System (HFACS) tool into the analytical protocol for understanding the potential risks specific to air tour operations. 
Cognitive Analysis: Flight Route Task-Load and Workload:  Conduct a detailed cognitive analysis of the flight route task-load and workload to generate a full cognitive workload description for each task.  The cognitive analysis will then be linked to the airspace simulation model of the aircraft routes to provide a mapping of the cognitive workload.  
Task 3. Analysis of Proposed AlternativeAnalyze the components of the proposed air tour routes and operations, which differ from those in the baseline condition.  To the extent possible, given that no operational data will be available, the same metrics determined in Task 2 will be re-evaluated for the new operational environment  to the extent needed to execute a valid comparative analysis.  The methodology for determining values for metrics for the proposed alternative should include modeling and simulation such as TAAM and/or SIMMOD, or other analytical methods.  Human factors metrics comparable with those developed in Task 2 will also be evaluated.
Task 4.  Comparative Analysis A comparative analysis of the results of Task 2 and Task 3 shall be performed to evaluate current conditions vs. proposed conditions and assembled into a report.  
All capability information shall include: Contract number; Customer (DOD agency, other Government agency, private industry); Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) name, telephone and fax numbers; contract value and type of contract; period of performance; and description of product/services. Information provided should be detailed in the area(s) above so the Government can assess the ability of the company to provide the described services.  All of the information sought should be conveyed in no more than 10 pages.  Page size is set at 8? X 11 and text should be doubled spaced. Each response must reference the sources sought title.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541690 and the small business size standard is $7.0 million.  Interested parties must respond to this announcement in writing within 15 days of publication.  Telephonic requests will not be honored.  All responses must be sent to Elizabeth A. Segal, Contracting Officer, RTV-6D1, United States Department of Transportation, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA  02142.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) Joint Munitions & Lethality LifeCycle Management Command is seeking potential sources who are capable of providing a Bundesanstalt fur Materialprufung (BAM, English translation Committee for Materials Testing) Friction Tester as described by MIL STD 1751A Method 1024, Annex A in STANAG 4487, or AOP-7.  Thisequipment will be used to measure the response of solid energetic materials to a friction stimulus generated between two roughened porcelain surfaces.The results shall be expressed numerically (as a 50% point in newtons (N))which will allow for a relative sensitivity ranking. Although liquids and pastes are not generally tested, interested sources that can provide a friction tester capable of testing liquids, pastes and solid energetic materials are encouraged to provide this information.  The BAM friction tester must be 110/120V and be capable of fitting into a 3ft (length) by 3ft (width) area.  The BAM friction apparatus must consist of a reciprocating sample table which holds a porcelain sample plate.  In addition, the Friction Tester must be equipped with a lever arm to which a porcelain pin is attached.  The porcelain pin shall be 15 mm long and 10 mm in diameter, with rounded ends of approximately 10 mm radius of curvature. The porcelain plates shall be 25-mm square and 5-mm thick. The total (peak-to-peak) displacement of the horizontal motion shall be 10 mm with the full cycle taking about one second tocomplete.  This piece of equipment must be capable of testing weights of varying mass (samples to be placed between the pin and plate) that are attached at different distances on the lever arm which shall adjust the force applied between the porcelain pin and plate. The friction tester shall be driven by an eccentric arm attached to a geared-down electric motor which executes one revolution of the eccentric arm (one full cycle of reciprocating motion in the horizontal direction) when the motor is actuated.  Interested sources shall also be capable of supplying weights with the standard BAM apparatus, which must be capable of providing a force on the pin of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 18 kg when suspended from the position nearest the pin. This can be increased by factors of 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 by suspending the weights from successively more distant positions. Loads varying from 5 to 360 N can thus be realized. In addition to the standard BAM weights, potential sources shall also be able to supply weights with the small BAM apparatus, which must be capable of providing a force on the pin of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45 and 0.5 kg when suspended from the position nearest the pin. This can be increased by factors of 1.5 and 2.0 by suspending the weights fromsuccessively more distant positions. Loads varying from 0.1 to 10 N can thus be realized.  It is requested that interested sources submit sufficient information to demonstrate their ability to meet the above requirement.  It is also requested that submissions be kept to 10 pages or less.  Respondents should submit their capabilities to the following point of contact no later than December 8, 2008:  William Tenz, e-mail: william.d.tenz@us.army.mil.  Interested firms should also provide their address, point-of-contact with telephone number, e-mail address, and size of business (small/large).  This announcement is for informational planning purposes only, and is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Highlighter, Retractable, Biobased and Biodegradable by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2016</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is GSA, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Highlighter, Retractable, Biobased and Biodegradable to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>No similar products.</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Wiper, Laminated to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than COB, Friday, November 28, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0030. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-09-R-625217 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.  This is a small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 336611.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

Amendment 1
11/13/08

Please note the following changes to the Solicitation:

On page 1, Item K. Technical POC phone number should be 760.830.1932 (name is correct: SAL 
MARTINEZ)

On pages 2 through 9, Items 1 through 15 the "EST 1-YR Qty" in all items is the quantity of 
full bottles we sell, not the Unit of Issue we sell. For example on Item #1, Acetylene, the 
EST 1-YR Qty is 30 bottles (i.e. 300 CF), not 30 CF as implied by the way the response table 
is layed out in the RFQ.

On page 6, Item #10 says "MIN 350 psi."  It should read "MIN 3500 psi." The amount of gas in 
a Cubic Foot varies depending on the pressure. These bottles are normally filled to 3500 
psi.  A vendor bidding on a 340 CUFT bottle at 350 psi would be bidding far too low for the 
actual quantity delivered in a 340 CUFT bottle at 3500 psi.

On page 8, Item #14 MAPP GAS, the unit of issue is incorrect. MAPP gas is sold by the pound, 
not by the cubic foot.

On page 9, Item 16 Repair and Maintenance, "One Year of Repair and maintenance for Items 
1-15" cannot be estimated in one line item because hydro-testing is only required every 10 
years. There is no way to estimate how many hydro tests might be required in a given year, 
it could be all of the tanks or none of the tanks. This should be broken out into two lines:

		 Item 16a "One Year of Repair and Maintenance for Items 1-15, (i.e. valves, markings, etc.)"

		 Item 16b "Hydro-test, as required"

There are no other changes.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC><p>The Support Services Management Office (AAC/ENRS), Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB Florida is interested in receiving information relating to a potential Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) program to provide a variety of non-engineering technical and acquisition management disciplines for the Air Armament Center (AAC) at Eglin AFB, AAC organizations at other locations, and other organizations located at Eglin AFB. The program will be the follow-on to the current Technical and Acquisition Management Support (TAMS) 3 program. The AAC develops, tests, acquires and sustains integrated air armament and provides expeditionary combat support needed to defend the United States and its interests. Functional areas are anticipated to include: program management; test and evaluation management; environmental management; budget analysis; cost analysis; program analysis; logistics management; information technology; acquisition security; and administrative support. The TAMS 3 Statement of Work (SOW) and other documentation have previously been posted on FedBizOpps. As a follow-up to discussions at an Industry Meeting on a potential TAMS 4 Program conducted on 28 August 2008, this is a Request for Information (RFI) to identify potential risks to the development, award and management of an efficient and effective TAMS 4 Program. Risks submitted in response to this RFI should be clearly described and defined including information concerning the likelihood of the risk event occurring and potential consequences to the Program. The identified risks and supporting information will be used as a starting point in development of a program risk assessment. The results of the risk assessment will be used to identify aspects of the program acquisition strategy, as well as key discriminators to be used as source selection evaluation criteria. Sources responding to this RFI may be invited to participate directly in the future development of acquisition strategy alternatives, including contract type and special clauses, and eventually the development of a Request for Proposal (RFP). For reference, the TAMS 3 Risk Assessment is archived on FedBizOpps under FA9200-05-R-0002. A Risk Assessment Meeting will be conducted to discuss the identified risks on 11 December 2008 at Eglin AFB, Building 11, Room 105, from 0830 to 1630 (may end earlier). Registration will begin at 0800. Attendees should expect to actively participate in discussions rather than attend to observe. Attendance is limited based on size of facility. Due to the compressed agenda for the day, we are expecting to work through lunch; food will be available for purchase (details to follow). In order to attend the Risk Assessment Meeting, submit a Visit Request (email preferred which references TAMS 4) by close of business 8 December 2008 to Ms Mary Steinmetz, Contract Specialist, AAC/ENRS (PKES), 102 West D Avenue, Suite 160, Bldg 11, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6808, Phone (850) 882-2925, email mary.steinmetz@eglin.af.mil with a copy to Elaine Fryback, email Elaine.fryback@eglin.af.mil . The Visit Request should identify: Company Name, Company Address, Attendee Name, Company Phone, Fax and Email information. A social security number (SSN) is also required to receive a pass through the MAX security system to enter the base. Provide the SSN to Mary Steinmetz by encrypted email (preferred), by FAX to 850-882-3052 (call ahead to 850-882-2925 before faxing) or by telephone to Mary Steinmetz 850-882-2925. Each interested company may have one person attend the Risk Assessment Meeting. The Visit Request and SSN are the only information required prior to the Risk Assessment Meeting. A map is attached. Contractors that are unable to attend the Risk Assessment Meeting will not be excluded from participating in future industry meetings or competition for this effort. Also, Contractors unable to attend may obtain information presented at the Risk Assessment Meeting from Mr Bruce Melusen, AAC/ENRS, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 160, Bldg 11, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6807, Phone (850) 883-3539, bruce.melusen2@eglin.af.mil. The attendee list and the results of the risk assessment will be posted on FedBizOpps for all interested parties. Once an acquisition strategy has been selected and approved, a draft RFP will be incrementally posted on FedBizOpps prior to the release of the formal RFP. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a RFP or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responses will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this contemplated effort. The information you provide may be utilized by the Air Force in developing its acquisition strategy. Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. Sources responding to this RFI are requested to submit the identified risk information by 8 December 2008 to Ms Mary Steinmetz, Contract Specialist, AAC/ENRS (PKES), 102 West D Avenue, Suite 160, Bldg 11, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6808, Phone (850)882-2925, email mary.steinmetz@eglin.af.mil.

<p>The Acquisition and Contracting Division (AFCEE/AC), Brooks City-Base Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is conducting an acquisition for the Environmental, Construction and Operations &amp; Services 2009 (ECOS09) program. This is a source selection for environmental, construction and operations and services at sites located primarily on DoD (mostly Air Force) installations worldwide with an emphasis on CONUS, for which AFCEE customers have responsibility. ECOS09 is 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan (CWP/IWP) are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS). This is a follow-on contract to the current ECOS contract and is critical to meet AFCEE's future mission and anticipated workload.</p>

The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements. This requirement is a small business set-aside consisting of approximately five (5) to eight (8) awards and will have a ceiling of $350M. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>
<p>Excess bonding capacity is $2.5M. Contract Fair Opportunity Selection and Ordering Procedure clauses will be used to compete task orders against the successful offerors. Terms of contract(s) include a five year ordering period plus two additional years for performance.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 14 November 2008. The RFP will be issued via FedBizOpps and posted on the AFCEE ECOS09 website, located at https://www.afceeprivweb.brooks.af.mil/pkv/ecos09/default.asp.

<p>4.Revision 01 to Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 and Clause FAR 52.212-2, "Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Past Performance<br />(2) Price<br />With Past Performance being significantly more important when compared to price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2<br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>This is a competitive best value in which competing offeror' s present/past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price consideration. By submission of it's' offer, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to prices, including any option prices to include all incentive option periods. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each. The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated under the following subparagraph B, the completeness and reasonable of the proposed total evaluated price. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.</p>
<p>B. Using questionnaires, the Contracting Officer shall seek performance information on the lowest priced offerors (usually the lowest three to five) based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. The Government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a substantial confidence assessment. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the efforts as described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirements will be rated highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history shall receive the rating of "Unknown Confidence".</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a Substantial Confidence Assessment, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Contracting Officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal instructions. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal, (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposals revisions.</p>
<p>G. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>E. Performance Confidence Assessment Table.<br />SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />NO<br />CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>

<SOLNBR>ASTMF265607 
<ARCHDATE>03212009
<CONTACT>Vincent J Sanchez, Phone 703-875-6629, Email SanchezVJ@state.gov
<DESC>Effective February 1, 2009, the United States Department of State (DOS) will no longer be certifying anti-ram barriers under it's current Anti-ram barrier standard, STD-02.01 Revision A dated March 2003. Beginning February 1, 2009, DOS will evaluate only new anti-ram barriers tested under ASTM F2656-07 Standard Test Method for Vehicle Crash Testing of Perimeter Barriers for the selection and approval for use at DOS facilities. The only barriers considered will be those with an ASTM F2656-07 rating of M30 P1, M40 P1, and M50 P1. Furthermore, DOS will only consider barriers in which the impact point has been chosen or agreed to by the DOS. As stated in ASTM F2656-07, failure to consult with DOS regarding the impact point may jeopardize the eligibility of the barrier to be installed at DOS facilities.

DOS will no longer issue anti-ram barrier certification letters for tests performed after January 31, 2009. Any tests successfully performed on or before January 31, 2009 will be considered eligible for the issuance of a DOS certification letter. Upon issuance of the last certification letter, DOS will publish the last List of DOS Certified Anti-Ram barriers sometime in early 2009. 

DOS is currently transitioning to an internal approved barrier list. This list will be a subset of all current and future barriers that meet the ASTM F2656-07 and/or STD-02.01 Revision A dated March 2003 test criteria. Barriers placed on this new list will be selected specifically for DOS facilities based on newly developed in-house critieria. Barriers will be added and removed from this new internal approved list as facility needs warrant. 

DOS wishes to thank the testing facilities, barrier manufacturers, and members of ASTM in their successful efforts in transitioning the DOS anti-ram test procedure into a self-regulated International Standard.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification Notice is to provide the following information to all parties.
Question: From what I understand, you are referring to an NSN as being a 13-digit numeric code which is used to identify military supply equipment. Is this correct?Answer: Yes. NSN stands for National Stock Number.
Question: MFG part numbers refer to manufacturers' part number. Is this correct?Answer: Yes
Question: What is meant by CAGE?Answer: CAGE stands for Commercial and Government Entity Code and is a 5-digit code used to identify suppliers and manufacturers.
Question: You are asking for a cross referenced list of NSNs. Is there a specific list of NSNs that you need a cross referenced MFG and CAGE?Answer: The Federal Logistics Information System is a component/cross referenced list used to cross reference part numbers to NSNs.
Question: From what I understand Allowance Parts List (APL)/Allowance Equipage List (AEL) are distributed on a quarterly basis and become obsolete very quickly. Also, from what I understand there is at least a proposed APL/AEL Distribution system solution which is already implemented. Why do you need APLs and AELs from us? Would you be the one to be providing that information and we will be the ones who will build a database solution for you to manage data and carry out research?Answer: APLs and AELs are distributed quarterly throughout the United States Navy Fleet and some shore activities.  The government requires APLs and AELs to identify configuration and conduct ordering of parts to repair and or equip naval activities.  The government will not provide that information.  The government is requesting the service and will not be building the database solution.
Question: Please elaborate on what you looking for with respect to United Kingdom (UK) North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) add on and global deposit account for commercial standards.  Answer: UK/NATO add on are NSNs associated primarily and uniquely to the UK and NATO countries.  This feature is a NSN add-on to the basic logistics database described in the solicitation.  A global deposit account is used for those services that must be obtained from outside commercial sources.

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, is issuing a SECOND DRAFT Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-08-R-0013, for the Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance (NS CTA).  The purpose of the United States Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance (NS CTA) Program Announcement (PA) is to solicit offers to establish a new Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA) in the area of Network Science consisting of three research areas focused on Social/Cognitive Networks, Information Networks, and Communication Networks.  Each of these basic research areas is to be led by an academic institution and will be referred to as an Academic Research Center (ARC).  The fourth research area, Integration Research, referred to as the Integration Research Center (IRC), is focused on achieving integrated information-social/cognitive-communications networks by promoting and performing cross-cutting basic research, implementing theory, computation and experiment that characterize and provide insights into the interplay and composability of these interacting complex networks, and advancing the basic research breakthroughs through an applied research program.  In addition to performing and leading basic research on network science integration issues, the IRC will perform applied research and execute the management and transition responsibilities of the CTA.  The Army envisions this alliance will bring together government, industrial, and academic institutions to address research and development to enable Network-Centric Warfare and Network-Centric Operations.  The SECOND DRAFT NS CTA PA has been posted at the NS CTA website: www.arl.army.mil/networkscience.  This PA will result in the award of two instruments:  (1) a cooperative agreement as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the Fundamental Research Component; and (2) a procurement contract as defined in 31 U.S.C. 6303 for the execution of the Technology Transition Component.  The cooperative agreement for the Fundamental Research Component will be awarded to a Consortium consisting of four Principal Members.  Three of the Principal Members will come from the three ARCs (one from each Center) described above with the fourth coming from the IRC.  Each Principal Member may also include General Members as necessary and appropriate to fulfill the goals of the NS CTA Program. The Principal Members associated with the ARCs for Information Networks, Social/Cognitive Networks, and Communications Networks must be academic concerns.  Further, each of the three ARCs is required to include an HBCU/MI as the Principal or as a General Member. The Principal Member for IRC may be an academic, non-profit or industrial concern, and will be the Lead of the Consortium.  The procurement contract will be awarded to the Principal Member or General Member specified as such in the IRC proposal that is selected for award.  Individual tasks will be issued under the procurement contract as transition opportunities are identified from the research results under the cooperative agreement.   Under this PA, proposals are sought to select the four Principal Members for the NS CTA.  Proposals must address only one of the three ARCs or the IRC.  The proposed Principal Member for each ARC and the IRC is responsible for submitting the proposal on behalf of any General Members included in their proposal.  Should an offeror desire to propose under more than one of the Centers, a complete separate proposal must be submitted for each area.  There will be one cooperative agreement award that will be made to a Consortium consisting of the four Principal Members selected for award and any General Members included in their proposals.  There will be one contract award to the Principal Member or General Member specified in the IRC proposal that is selected for award.  Planned funding levels for the NS CTA are set forth in the PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the Network Science consortium for five years with an option for an additional five years.

<CONTACT>Helen B Nelson, Phone 860-441-2843, Email helen.r.nelson@uscg.mil
<DESC>THIS UPDATE IS ISSUED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLARIFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RFI:

1) WE ARE ACCEPTING ALL RESPONSES THAT MEET AT LEAST ONE OF THE SIX CRITERIA LISTED IN THIS RFI.

2) AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT PHONE CALLS OR REPLY TO VOICEMAIL MESSAGES REGARDING THIS RFI.  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL MESSAGES.

This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the United States Coast Guards needs.  The Coast Guard Research and Development Center (R&DC) is tasked by Congress to determine the most effective Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) to operate off the National Security Cutter (NSC).  The project was initiated with a study of the environmental, Concept of Operation (CONOP) and physical constraints associated with operation of a UAS from the NSC.  The project is now at a point where it needs to solicit feedback from Government, industry and academia to identify potential sources of suitable UASs.  

The Coast Guard is currently building new NSCs which are flight deck equipped cutters (FDECs). The NSCs will conduct most of the Coast Guards missions, including counter drug law enforcement, migrant interdiction, living marine resources (aka fisheries enforcement), and defense readiness.  The NSCs will often operate independently, relying on their own sensors to surveil, detect, classify, identify, and prosecute (SDCIP) targets of interest.  Through multiple analyses previously conducted, the R&DC has shown that properly configured UASs may offer significant benefit to USCG mission execution.

The USCG R&DC intends to use the information collected from this RFI to conduct detailed analysis that reflects State of the Technology capabilities. These capabilities will be assessed by the R&DC in terms of contribution to NSC Mission performance metrics. Information obtained through this RFI may also be used to identify systems for Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) currently planned for mid 2009. 

Notional Operational Profiles

(1)  UASs will perform surveillance to support the NSCs in the detection, classification, identification and tracking of surface targets while providing near real-time data to the NSC.

(2) UASs will loiter over targets of interest while providing near real-time data to the NSCs.

(3) UASs will relocate previously detected targets and perform a classification and identification.

You are invited to respond with information to assist the Coast Guard R&DC with its market research to identify potential sources of cutter-deployed UASs (including platform, payloads, Ground Control Station (GCS), and control and data links).  For purposes of this RFI, UASs are the aerial vehicles, payloads (i.e., radars, Electrical Optical/Infra-Red, Automatic Identification System, Directional Finder, etc.), and control and communications capabilities. The Coast Guard is interested in technology that can be operated and maintained on NSCs operating anywhere in the worldwide maritime environment.

Attachment A is provided to assist you in responding to this RFI.  Attachment A consists of one worksheet provided for informational purposes only (NSC_Constraints) and three worksheets to be submitted in response to this RFI (RFI Data Parameters, EO IR Data Sheet and Radar Data Sheet).  It is essential to complete the RFI Data Parameters and EO IR Data Sheet and Radar Data Sheet, if applicable. 

The Coast Guard R&DC intends to conduct a rigorous analysis of all potential platforms and payloads. Therefore, we request that you (1) provide detailed information on your products that meet or exceed the criteria listed below and (2) complete the data sheets provided as Attachment A Worksheets (RFI Data Parameters, EO IR Data Sheet and Radar Data Sheet).


Criteria (Not in Any Particular Order)
 
(1)  UAS shall be able to be launched and recovered, operated, maintained, and hangared on the NSC (see Attachment A Worksheet NSC Constraints for general information)

(2)  UAS platform shall be capable of carrying and supporting mission applicable payloads that include sensors and C2 systems

(3) UAS sensor payloads shall be capable of detecting, classifying, identifying and tracking targets in the maritime environment

(4)  UAS command and control payloads shall be capable of permitting the NSC to maintain positive control of the platform, and providing for the near real-time transmission of data (radar, EO/IR, etc.)

(5)  UAS platform shall use fuels compatible with the NSC shipboard environment (MOGAS and AVGAS is prohibited for shipboard use)

(6)  UAS (platform, payloads, and full fuel load) shall be able to be handled on deck by ships personnel, and operated and maintained by Coast Guard personnel under all expected operational conditions

Responding to This Market Survey

When responding to this market survey, please include the following information:

(1)  Detailed description of the potential UAS (platform, payloads, GCS, and control links)

(2)  Completed attached data sheets (Attachment A Worksheets RFI Data Parameters; EO IR Data Sheet and Radar Data Sheets, if applicable)

(3)  List of U.S. (or international) government contracts for products being submitted as applicable

(4)  Any digital photos and/or digital videos of the products in operation 
NOTE:   If your submittal is greater than 10 MB, please provide on DVD media and mail to:  
		Attn: Helen Nelson
		U.S. Coast Guard Research & Development Center
		1082 Shennecossett Road
		Groton, CT  06340-6048

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.  Responses to this market survey should be sent to RDC-PF-NSC-UAS-RFI@uscg.mil. Information submitted will be reviewed by Government personnel at the Coast Guard R&DC and members of the R&DCs System Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) Contractor Team, who will assist the Government with this effort. NOTE: Non-governmental personnel have signed non-disclosure agreements.

In your response, using NAICS Code 541330, please identify whether you are a Small or Large Business.  PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED, VOICE MAIL MESSAGES LEFT WILL NOT BE RETURNED AND EMAILS RECEIVED WILL NOT BE RESPONDED TO.  Please limit electronic responses to no more than 20 pages (Attachment A will not be counted towards the 20-page limit).  Respondents are requested to respond no later than December 1, 2008.

<AWARDEE>General Dynamics, Garland , TX 75040 US
<DESC><p>The Air Armament Center, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron at Eglin AFB, FL 32542 is contemplating the sole source award of purchase order FA8677-09-M-0081 to GD/OTS Garland, 1200 North Glenbrock Drive, Garland, TX 75040. It is intended that the award be made to support the on-going test and qualification of Insensitive Munitions (IM) and design enhancements to accommodate AFX-795 explosive fill in the MK84 Mod 10 empty case with IM Improvements. The MOD 10 after delivery and lapped with AFX-795 make up a BLU-117 general purpose warhead. A December 2008 award is anticipated for the procurement of five (5) MK84 Mod 10 warhead cases valued at an estimated $33,000.00. The MK84 Mod 10 case configuration with the incorporation of the improved IM components will make up the BLU-117 configuration. The MK84 Mod 10 has a TDP number of 923AS425 Rev B. managed by the Navy and procured through the Navy once the 685th finishes final qualification of the new design. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The procurement of 5 MK84 Mod 10 cases can only be met by GD-OTS because they are the only vendor that has been successfully qualified by Joint Munitions Command (JMC) to manufacture these products to the Government's specifications. In addition, their existing tooling will allow deliveries in time to meet the accelerated qualification schedule directed by the Air Staff. The hardware improvements for the BLU-117 shall be manufactured in accordance with (IAW) the following drawings: 923AS425 Rev B. The 5 assembled MK84 Mod 10 warhead cases are to be shipped to McAlister Army Ammunition Plant.
<p>A firm fixed price type purchase order is contemplated. It is estimated that the purchase order will have a period of performance of 3 months. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the points of contact identified below. The AAC Ombudsman is BGen Michael N. Wilson, AAC/CV, (850) 882-5422, or michael.wilson2@eglin.af.mil. For further information concerning technical aspects, contact Joseph Stromsness, (850) 883-3235 or e-mail joseph.stromsness@eglin.af.mil or Terry Byrd 850-883-7571 or email terry.byrd@eglin.af.mil . For contractual information, contact Fred Tingle, 850-883-3218, e-mail fred.tingle@eglin.af.mil.</p>
