<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of 12 new Transportable SATCOM Ground Terminals (TSGT), including 9 full terminals and 3 support rigs, and the upgrade of 7 Tri-band TSGTs in the NATO inventory. These projects are included in Project serial 2003/0CM03018-0 under CP 0A0149 for the procurement of SATCOM Communications System Capabilities, that include the procurement of 12 TSGTs and Project serial 2003/0CM03034-0 under CP 5A0030 for the upgrade of the 7 second generation TSGTs.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the Infrastructure Committee.  The rough cost estimate of the project is 22.85 million EUR ($27.5 million USD) for the procurement of 12 TSGTs and 3.54 million EUR ($4.3 million USD) for the upgrade of the 7 TSGTs. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) is IFB-CO-11790-TSGT. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Both projects are expected to be completed in 18 months from the Effective Date of Contract (EDC). The Invitation for Bids (IFB) will be structured in 2 portions reflecting the procurement of new TSGTs and the upgrade of the NATO-owned tri-band TSGTs. The Bidders will be allowed to choose whether to bid for only one or for both portions. The two portions will be evaluated and awarded separately.

The competitive bidding is limited to companies experienced with the provision of similar types of systems; in addition, the bidders will be required to submit with their bid a Certificate of Conformity (COC) in accordance with STANAG 4107 for the qualified Terminal (TSGT) that they will propose for the new TSGT project. 

The envisaged method of bidding for both portions will be the One Envelope Procedure in which the Price Proposals are opened and evaluated and the bids ranked in order by lowest price. Technical Evaluation then commences with the lowest price bid until a fully compliant bid is found.

ELIGIBILITY

Interested firms must be nominated by their National Authorities with the required Declaration of Eligibility. REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED.

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a Bid Guarantee of 200,000 EUR for the first portion (procurement of TSGTs) and 100,000 EUR for the second portion (upgrade). Should the selection and award procedure exceed the 12 month after Bid Closing Date, firms will be requested to voluntarily extend the validity of their bids and Bid Guarantee accordingly. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

National authorities are advised that the ICB package, including technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO UNCLASSIFIED. If classified material will have to be included in the ICB package or in the Bidders response to the IFB, the transmission of it shall be processed through their respective National Delegation/Mission to NATO.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Embassy in Brussels to submit a Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) on your behalf: 1 November 2005.

2. Anticipated date that the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB/IFB) will be forwarded to those on the Bidder List (distribution of the Cahier des Charges): End of December 2005

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: April 2006 (at least 84 days after issue of IFB)

4. Anticipated contract award date: September 2006

CERTIFICATION

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SERVE AS THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR NATO PROJECTS. HOWEVER, ALL FIRMS WHOSE FACILITY IS LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO BID FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. 

The contracting entity is the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A). Only firms that the U.S. Department of Commerce has certified as eligible will be allowed to bid. A Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) will be submitted on their behalf to the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, which will in turn provide the Declaration of Eligibility to the contracting entity.
