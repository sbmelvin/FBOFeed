<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to:

1. Change to proposal response date from 5 Dec 2006 to 7 Dec 2006. 

2. Change the segment in Paragraph 1.2 of the Statement of Work which reads: "This system must operate at levels determined safe to allow drivers to remain in their vehicles while they are processed and will improve thoroughfare rates.  The system must also use low dose rate technologies to ensure officer and public safety and will not require any additional exclusion zones outside the system?s footprint."

TO:
For efficiency purposes, the government prefers a system that allows drivers to remain in their vehicles while the vehicle and cargo is scanned.  A system which requires the driver to exit the vehicle must use low dose rate technologies to ensure driver, officer and public safety and will not require any additional exclusion zones outside the system?s footprint.

3.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
