<CONTACT>Sharon Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 427-1781, Fax 301 427-1740, Email swilliam@ahrq.gov
<DESC>Title:  Update of PHS Clinical Practice Guideline:  Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is planning on awarding on a sole-source basis to the University of Wisconsin Medical School, Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (CTRI), a contract to carry out the planning evaluation, and analytical type activities required to update the Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline, Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence , led by the AHRQ.  This is follow-up work to a contract awarded to the University of Wisconsin CTRI in 1998.  Areas to be addressed in the update will include but not be limited to: significant new findings in treating tobacco dependence that have been published since 2000 including any additional pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation, treatment approaches for specific populations; e.g., racial and ethnic groups, women, smokers with co-morbid conditions, quitlines, concurrent use of counseling and medication.  The Update will also address system interventions; e.g., tobacco dependence coverage, cost benefit analyses, and tailored interventions.

The University of Wisconsin-Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (UW-CTRI) maintains a unique repository of data regarding tobacco dependence and its treatment stemming from their past work in executing the guideline and their role as a lead research organization in tobacco cessation.  

For the previous full guideline update completed in 1999, the UW-CTRI staff reviewed and classified over 6000 articles related to smoking cessation.  The review of over 2400 articles meeting basic screening criteria at that time included use of a sophisticated screening, classification, taxonomy, and evaluation system.  Clinical trial review categories, for example, included provider types, intervention formats, pharmacotherapies, theoretical bases, intensity and special populations where there were sufficient data for analysis.  Each one of these rubrics involves explicit criteria for subcategories that allowed for reliable coding of articles with respect to each dimension.  UW-CTRI is unique in housing all of the coding categories and application rules that would allow for effective, expeditious integration of prior work done in guideline development with future work.  

Since the time of the previous Guideline, the UW-CTRI has continued to monitor a wide-ranging data set of materials that are currently in place relating to smoking cessation that would be used in this Guideline update such as: a) Data on health systems applications of smoking cessation and b) Data base on tobacco dependence.  Moreover, the CTRI has developed meta-analysis strategies and tools that would be required in this Guideline update.

The proposed acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  For this requirement, sources must have an understanding of and, preferably, experience in, health services research.  Sources must also possess, or be able to obtain in-house or through subcontracting arrangements, the staff and other resources needed to expeditiously carry out the different types of required activities. 

Interested organizations capable of performing the above with the requisite qualifications and expertise, should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements as described above no later than December 7, 2005.  No solicitation document is currently available.  Capability statements should be submitted electronically to Sharon Williams at swilliam@ahrq.gov or paper copies (original and two copies) to Sharon Williams, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD  20850.  Capability statements received after December 7, 2005, will not be reviewed.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) is accepting proposals to develop and demonstrate large-area addressable masks for adaptive coded aperture imaging systems operating in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). DARPA’s Large Area Coverage Optical Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) program is seeking to develop extremely-wide field-of-view coded aperture imaging technology to support single sensor day/night persistent tactical surveillance of all moving vehicles in a large urban battlefield. The LACOSTE coded aperture imaging technology proposals should focus on achieving a very wide instantaneous field-of-regard (approximately 90 degree cone angle) using multiple simultaneous wide field-of-view (FOV) images. For persistent tactical surveillance, the coded aperture should provide 0.3 m resolution across a large coverage area (approximately 500 sqkm) while operating from a significant stand-off distance ( approximately 20 km). Analysis of multiple optical designs has identified coded apertures using large-area addressable masks as uniquely capable of meeting the objectives within reasonable cost, mass, and volume constraints. In coded apertures, a structured mask of pinhole cameras is created such that the image from each individual pinhole falls across a common focal plane array (FPA). With a large-area mask centered above a small FPA, the pinhole camera structure opens as a lens in the desired look direction while the remainder of the mask remains opaque. Knowing the mask structure, the multiple images on the same focal plane are digitally deconvolved to form an image. This concept provides several unique and enabling features. Orthogonally coded masks allow multiple simultaneous images at arbitrary pointing angles. Grouping pinholes enables electronically switchable resolution. The coded aperture replaces optical gain with digital processing gain. A critical enabling technology is the adaptive pinhole mask where each pixel is: physically small, addressable (either independently or in spatially distributed orthogonal groupings), millisecond switching speed, sufficient MWIR transmittance, low power consumption, large-area manufacturability, and extremely low cost-per-pixel. A detailed description of the program objectives, scope, and technology demonstration requirements are provided in the BAA 06-11 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.  PROGRAM SCOPE: Multiple awards are anticipated. Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Tim Clark, DARPA/SPO, Phone (703) 812-1975, tim.clark@darpa.mil. GENERAL INFORMATION: Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 06-11, Large Area Coverage Optical Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE), Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on the technical objectives, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, the FedGrants website: http://www.fedgrants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit a cover letter; two PC Compatible CD ROMs with a complete proposal (including the SOW); and a printed original plus 5 hardcopies of their proposal.  Each CD must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-11, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/SPO, Attn: Tim Clark, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Ref.: BAA 06-11) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, February 4, 2006, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and FedGrants.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-11 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received and to make award without discussions.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals will be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts –specifically, Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). BAH and SAIC are prohibited from competition on the LACOSTE program and are bound by appropriate nondisclosure requirements. BAH and SAIC will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations’ participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of the LACOSTE program. All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be sent via electronic mail to BAA06-11@darpa.mil. DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 06-11.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided. EVALUATION CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. Evaluation Criteria: 1. Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; 2. Relevance to DARPA LACOSTE program objectives; 3. Relevance of intermediate milestones (Go/No-Go’s); and 4. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs, fees (if any), and schedule.   Also, consideration will be given to the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals.  Individual proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.  This announcement and the Proposer Information Pamphlet may be retrieved via the WWW at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ in the solicitations area.

<SUBJECT>F--Invitation for Offer - Federal Natural Gas Liquids
<SOLNBR>BLM-2005-CHEU-001
<ARCHDATE>11212006
<CONTACT>Sherri Glover Contracting Officer 3032313936     ;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Amarillo Field Office  is requesting written offers to purchase Federal Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) produced from the Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU).  BLM's CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas, near the city of Amarillo. The BLM seeks to enter a NGL transportation and sales agreement for NGL volumes that will be advertised and renewed annually.  The NGL will be available at the tailgate of the Cliffside Helium Extraction Unit.  The BLM will produce helium and natural gas in a combined stream from the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir in Potter County, Texas, and separate the products at the CHEU.  The reservoir is about 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The BLM will store the NGL on site for pick up by the successful bidder on this agreement.  The BLM estimates the NGL volumes from CHEU will average 1,000 to 3,000 gallons per day, and will remain relatively steady through the 12- to 15-year life of this project. NGL pick up is expected to take place during regular business hours 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday.  A mutually agreed-to procedure will be established where BLM personnel will contact the buyer for NGL pick up when the storage amount reaches a predetermined level.  The NGL will be stored on site and the buyer will be required to pickup the liquids via truck transport.  The buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs. Pricing of NGL will be based upon current market values tied to a common spot market (such as Conway, Kansas NGL Trading Hub) and the quality of the NGL.  The NGL at the pickup point is a non-fractionated liquid byproduct.  An automatic sampling system will be an integral part of the installation; however, the analysis of samples will be the responsibility of the buyer.  Operational details of the project (e.g. maps, NGL quality, etc.) are available upon request.  Interested parties are encouraged to contact John Hamak at 806-356-1025 or Nabil Dia at 806-356-1023. You must submit a written offer via facsimile (fax no. 806-356-1041) by 4:00 p.m. Central Time on December 23, 2005.  We will award the offers by 4:00 p.m. on December 30, 2005.  You may call John Hamak or Nabil Dia with questions about this IFO. Offers The Exhibit is the offer sheet containing estimated daily production, preferred index prices, etc.  Your offer, an increment or decrement in relation to the applicable index, should be placed on the offer sheet.  Please note that we are selling all these NGL under a swing obligation on the daily market rather than using a base load and swing component.  The CHEU volume may increase or decrease through the term of this sale although BLM anticipates relatively stable production rates.   Bidder proposals will be accepted through 30 days after publication or December 23, 2005, whichever is earlier.  Please fax your proposals to fax number listed above or mail to the following address: BLM - Amarillo Field Office 801 S. Fillmore, Suite 500 Amarillo, TX  79101 Attn:  John Hamak Consideration of Offers BLM may award a contract on the basis of initial offer(s) without discussions.  Accordingly, each initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms that the offeror could submit.  However, BLM may negotiate with offerors in the event offers of similar or unanticipated value are received. The BLM shall award a Contract resulting from this IFO to the offeror whose offer, in BLM's judgment, is most advantageous to the Federal Government.  BLM will award to the buyer by means of a Natural Gas Liquids Purchase Confirmation Notice, which will also include payment instructions. Neither party shall disclose directly or without the prior written consent of the other party the terms of any transaction to a third party (other than the employees, lenders, royalty owners, counsel, accountants and other agents of the party, or prospective purchasers of all or substantially all of a party's assets or of any rights under this Contract, provided such persons shall have agreed to keep such terms confidential) except; (i) in order to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation, or exchange rule, (ii) to the extent necessary for the enforcement of this contract, (iii) to the extent necessary to implement any transaction, or (iv) to the extent such information is delivered to such third party for the sole purpose of calculating a published index.  Each party shall notify the other party of any proceeding of which it is aware which may result in disclosure of the terms of any transaction (other than as permitted hereunder) and use reasonable efforts to prevent or limit the disclosure.  The existence of this Contract is not subject to this confidentiality obligation.  The parties hereunder shall keep the terms of any transaction confidential for one year from the expiration of the transaction.  Term Initial deliveries of Federal NGL to the buyer will commence January 1, 2006  The delivery period will be for a term of twelve months ending December 31, 2006, unless either party cancels the transaction.   The reasons for which BLM may declare an early cancellation may be, but are not limited to: (1)	The failure to pay, when due, any payment required under this agreement, if such failure is not remedied within five [5] business days after written notice of such failure, provided that the payment is not the subject of a good faith dispute and the buyer pays BLM such amounts as it concedes to be correct;  (2)	Any representation or warranty which is proven to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated; or (3)	The failure to provide adequate financial assurances to BLM. Transportation and Planning of Natural Gas Liquids The buyer agrees to take 100 percent of the Federal NGL delivered at the delivery point for the entire contract period.  BLM will use reasonable efforts, consistent with industry practice, to inform the buyer regarding significant changes in NGL production levels and production shut-ins.  The buyer, through customary industry, will communicate directly with BLM.  The buyer, at its expense, shall make all necessary arrangements to receive delivery of Federal NGL at the delivery point.  The buyer is not responsible for costs of transportation upstream of the delivery point, nor is it responsible for storage costs of the Cliffside facility.  However, the buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs during and after pickup of the NGL from the plant site. No later than eight (8) calendar days before the first day of each month, BLM will notify the buyer of the weekly liquid volumes and quality anticipated for the following month of production.  The buyer understands that any such estimate is not a warranty of actual deliveries to be made, but is provided to facilitate planning of delivery of Federal NGL.  This will continue for each month of the delivery period. Liquidated Damages BLM will remarket the NGL in the event an early contract termination occurs.  BLM will collect from the terminated party an amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between the contract price less the price at which BLM is able to remarket the NGL not purchased, using commercially reasonable efforts in an arm's-length transaction.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to issue a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) to procure services involving behavioral, technology, and human factors research on traffic safety.  NHTSA plans and conducts a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors.  Additionally, NHTSA conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness, and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations.  NHTSA has identified two (2) research categories: 1) Lot A “Field Data Collection” and Lot B “Human Factors or Technological Research.”  Examples of the work to be performed under Lot A are: gathering information on local DWI saturation patrols, and examining the effectiveness of a safety belt program for teenagers. Many of the prospective research projects to be awarded  under this contract would require obtaining State and Federal driver, motor vehicle, and crash and fatality data and properly analyzing the data to determine whether a program had statistically significant effect on reducing crashes and saving lives. Examples of the work to be performed under Lot B are: determining whether new technology can determine whether a driver is impaired by alcohol based on performance measurements; whether parents can correctly use child safety seat; and whether a speed monitoring device has any impact on actual driving speed.  Alternatively, determining whether the drivers’ response to new technology enhances or diminishes potential safety improvements may be a critical factor in determining whether new safety systems produce real world benefits. Potential Offerors would be able to propose on either, or both, lots. This is a full and open competitive procurement and it is contemplated that an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC), on a Time and Material basis, will be awarded.  The period of performance of this contract is a three-year base period, plus two (2) renewable, one-year option periods, for a total potential contract period of five (5) years. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet, referencing the above solicitation number. These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizOpps.gov or www.eps.gov. The anticipated issuance date is on or about December 6, 2005. However, it is the Offeror’s sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors also will be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), and any other related documents.

Multiple vendor cases have been field tested and only the ECS Composites cases have been found to meet all of the requirements for these Cases. 2.	Use of other Cases would require a significant amount of time and money for training, redevelopment and delivery of interactive electronic training aids, redesign of systems engineering, retesting, reintegration, approval by Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), replacement of existing systems for configuration control, and rewriting and reapproval of IATO documentation would result.  Current estimates of this impact for a DJC2 program hardware item was estimated at approximately 16 months and $1.3M. 3.	Successful demonstration of product and service competency has been during the first 3 individual system purchases.  Due to the rapid procurement and fielding requirements of the DJC2 program office, this is deemed the most expedient and cost-effective method available for the short acquisition window.   The parts will be delivered 60 days after contract to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC>This is a Request for Quote (RFQ) that will be evaluated using Best Value procedures.  The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) intends to purchase one (1) each Hydrostatic Test System to Simulate Ocean Depths.  All quotes shall be Firm-Fixed Price and include costs for all equipment; materials; labor; installation; service agreements; training; operator and maintenance manuals; and warranty.  This system must meet or exceed the performance characteristics outlined in the attached performance specification:  NDBC SPECIFICATION FOR PROCUREMENT OF HYDROSTATIC TEST SYSTEM TO SIMULATE OCEAN DEPTHS.  The RFQ and specification are available for downloading on this website.  This specification contains the requirements for a turnkey hydrostatic test system to simulate various ocean depths.  Preference is for a system that can control temperature as well.  This system is to be used by NDBC to test tsunami detection bottom mounted pressure sensors and related systems.  The Hydrostatic Test System is to be installed in a non-environmentally controlled high bay building located on the John C. Stennis Space Center, Mississippi.  John C. Stennis Space Center is located approximately 48 miles west of Biloxi, Mississippi and 45 miles east of New Orleans, Louisiana.  The desired delivery date is ninety (90) calendar days following award.

The Government anticipates awarding a purchase order to the offeror whose quote is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  All quotes will be evaluated based on Technical, Past Performance, and Price.   The Technical and Past Performance evaluation factors are significantly more important than Price.   Technical is more important than Past Performance.  This Award will be made on a Best Value basis.  Award may be made to other than the lowest priced technically acceptable quote.  The Government, at its discretion, may award this purchase order without discussions.  Offerors shall identify and document all (if any) assumptions, conditions, or exceptions upon which the technical part of this quote is based.  All assumptions shall be included in the quote.  The following evaluation factors will be utilized:

A. GO/NO-GO FACTORS.

The Government will not evaluate any quotes that do not meet the following GO/NO-GO Factors:

1.  Able to achieve operating pressure of 10,000 PSI
2.  Able to maintain pressure for a minimum of 72 hrs within 2 percent of the target within the full operating range of the system
3.  Test Volume minimum size of 24 inches in diameter x 78 inches long/tall
4.  Constructed to National Board Registered and ASME Certified Conditions
5.  Design provides for safety of users (addressed in proposal)

B. NON-COST EVALUATION FACTORS.

The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following non-cost factors:

1. TECHNICAL.
Quotes will be reviewed to evaluate the offeror’s understanding of the requirement and capability to provide the best system that compliments long term program objectives.  The sub-factors for this major factor include:  
i. Long Term Maintenance:  This sub-factor will evaluate the ease of operation and maintenance; availability of parts/materials for repairs; required skills needed to perform maintenance; warranty terms and conditions; maintenance service agreement terms and conditions; and environmental disposal considerations. 
ii. Safety: This sub-factor will evaluate operator shielding; mechanical design factor of safety; interlock equipment and overrides; and ability to be locked out.
iii. Operations/Testing:  This sub-factor will evaluate ability to control temperature; operational test and maintenance procedures/inspections; ease of use; cycle time; data logging capability/time series/diagnostics; and the number of cable penetrations/flexibility
iv. Delivery Schedule:  This sub-factor will evaluate the speed of delivery of the system.
2.  PAST PERFORMANCE.   
The Government is seeking to determine whether the Offeror consistently delivers quality services in a timely manner.  This factor will be evaluated on the basis of relevant past performance for each Offeror and proposed teaming partners, during the last three years, on contracts/purchase orders consistent in scope and complexity with the objectives of this Request for Quote.  The information presented in the Offeror’s quote, together with information from any other sources available to the Government (i.e., Government-controlled Contractor performance databases, Inspector General reports, General Accounting Office reports, newspaper articles, references including contractual, technical, and end-user representatives, etc.) will provide the input for evaluation of this factor.  Include points of contact and their phone numbers, titles, and size of procurement in dollar value.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact.  

If the Offeror has no single experience that encompasses all types of past performance defined in the solicitation, the Offeror may show past performance through a combination of projects that together show that work has been accomplished that is consistent in scope and complexity.  The past performance information may include the Offeror’s record of providing high quality services in a timely manner, standards of good workmanship, adhering to contract schedules, administrative aspects of contract performance, overall quality of assigned personnel, availability, stability, reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to 
and business-like concern for the interests of the customer, quality of overall program management approach, record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction.  

Past performance that is technically relevant to this requirement will be of more value than non-relevant past performance.  A lack of relevant past performance data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.

All quotes shall provide enough information for the Government to conduct its evaluation.  Any quotes received without the required information may be removed from consideration.  This solicitation is 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside.  See Numbered Note #1.  The NAICS Code is 334519 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  All quotes must be submitted no later than 4:00pm Central on December 6, 2005.  Offerors may mail, fax, or e-mail quotes to the contact information below:

Treatments will occur in June, July and early August of each year.

The amount and location of work to be offered in 2007 and 2008 cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy at this time because gypsy moth populations fluctuate widely in both space and time.  Therefore, this project is offered as an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity solicitation (IDIQ).  The total acreage and locations of the treatment blocks that make up each year’s project will be provided in annual task orders under the parent IDIQ.  The task order for 2006 will be issued with the solicitation and will include several hundred thousand acres of treatment divided into multiple bid items.  Task orders for 2007 and 2008 will be issued during the 1st quarter of those years respectively.

This project has been set aside exclusively for small business per FAR 19.502-2 (b) and will be awarded based upon a combination of both technical and cost factors. For more information, please contact Randy Lloyd (218-626-4360), or Donna Leonard (828-684-8796).  Prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Official date for receipt of proposals will be shown on the bid package.  The solicitation package will be posted in it’s entirety at this site at a later date.  The applicable NAICS code is 115112 and the associated Small Business Size standard is $6.0 Million.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Center Philadelphia intends to negotiate a Sole Source contract for the Advance Bomb Suit and Helmet System currently in use by the U.S. Army. The requirement is to purchase sustainment quantities for the Advanced Bomb Suit, model EOD-8, and EOD-8 Helmet System, manufactured by Med-Eng Systems, Inc. of Canada. The quantities to be procured are 20 each EOD-8 Bomb Suit and 14 each EOD-8 helmet System. The Med-Eng EOD-8 Bomb Suit is a proven technology which is currently in use by the Army. It is necessary to continue to procure the EOD-8 Bomb Suit and EOD-8 Helmet System from Med-Eng Systems in order to ensure compatibility with currently fielded equipment including communications systems and Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical protection capabilities. It is believed that no alternative commercial off the shelf bomb suits possess the required overall design and integration of components, ballistics, blast, impact protection, and features necessary to meet the Operation Requirements Document (ORD). The Advanced Bomb Suit is a proprietary, unique, and innovative system, and is the only Explosive Ordnance Disposal suit system available that adequately meets the ORD requirements. 

This acquisition will be sole source to Med-Eng Systems Inc. Drawings are not available. No request for proposal is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying the requirement, to include descriptive literature, within 15 days of this announcement to the contact person listed below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer (AE) Act as implemented by FAR Subpart 36.6.  A firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work identified in this announcement.  AE services required are master planning, conceptual design, and program integration.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  A firm-fixed-price indefinite delivery type contract wil l be negotiated.  The contract is anticipated to be awarded in March 2006.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it plans to subcon tract.  The plan is not required with this submittal.  In the event this contract is used to develop design-build supporting documents for use in a two-phase design-build selection (FAR 36.302), the prime AE and subconsultants shall be prohibited from team ing with design-build firms to compete in the final design-build construction solicitation in accordance with FAR 9.505-2 (Preparing specifications or work statements) and FAR 36.209 (Construction contracts with Architect-Engineer Firms.)  BACKGROUND: Unde r the BRAC 05 decision effective November 8, 2005, the Department of Defense (DoD) will relocate an estimated 21,000 personnel to Fort Belvoir, an Army installation located in southern Fairfax County, VA.  Under 10 U.S.C. § 2904(a), the realignment of Fort  Belvoir must be completed by September 15, 2011.  The Armys overarching goal for the realignment is to transform Fort Belvoir into a world-class facility supporting a community of military and national security organizations.  To accomplish this goal and  to complete the realignment, the Army estimates a need to construct approximately 6,000,000 square feet of space, as well as transportation systems and supporting infrastructure.  Given the complexity of the realignment, the Army intends to have this cont ract address three functional areas required to prepare for the orderly migration of personnel to Fort Belvoir:  1)  Planning; 2) Conceptual design services; and 3) Program integration, management, and oversight.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  AE Standard Form (SF ) 330 submittals must clearly address these project requirements:  Planning.  Comprehensive military master planning and master development: developing a comprehensive  master plan and development strategy for Fort Belvoir that supports transforming Fort B elvoir into a world-class facility supporting a community of military and national security organizations.  Firms must demonstrate experience with 1391 preparation, conduct of planning charrettes and military master planning components including but not li mited to long range, short range, capital investment strategy, installation design guides, geographic information system  (GIS) development and sustainment; etc.   Environmental planning support:  conducting studies, analyses and planning for environmental  considerations (e.g., natural resources, cultural resources, environmental compliance, conservation, and remediation, etc.) and ensuring integration of environmental considerations into all aspects of master plan development and facilities design, constru ction, and operation.  The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District, leads the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning nationwide for BRAC 05.  However, it is anticipated support for NEPA work at Fort Belvoir may be required under t his contract.  Planning, integration, and oversight of environmental restoration projects affecting or related to development activities is covered under this procurement; however, the actual conduct of environmental restoration activities (i.e., investiga tions and removal or remedial actions to address contamination) is not included.  Supporting infrastructure planning and analysis: conducting studies, analyses,  and planning activities for the development of any new supporting infrastructure (e.g., electrical power, water distribution and wastewater collection systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), service roads, sidewalks, and parking, storm water management, force protection measures, site improvements including landscaping, and information systems) needed as a result of the development program envisioned for Fort Belvoir.  Transportation planning and analysis: conducting studies, analyses, a nd planning activities for the development of multi-modal transportation systems needed to provide an efficient, secure transportation system meeting near- and long-term transportation needs of Fort Belvoir.  Planning new buildings or renovating existing b uildings: conducting planning activities necessary to guide the design process by others for the construction of secure and non-secure administrative, intelligence, medical, operational and training facilities and other community support facilities (e.g., child development, recreational facilities).    Conceptual Design Services.  For purposes of this procurement, design activities include the myriad of actions typically occurring in advance of or in support of the preparation for final AE designs and drawi ngs, such as facilitating planning charrettes, preparing construction-related planning and budget programming documents (e.g., DD Forms 1391), developing conceptual design documents or drawings, and preparing procurement-related documentation.  This will n ot include development of final A/E designs or drawings or the actual construction of buildings.  The design of site development and infrastructure aspects may be carried to full plans and specifications for advertising or development of a Request for Prop osal for design-build.  Design work for National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) or DeWitt Army Hospital is not part of this AE procurement.  Design for Supporting Infrastructure: design activities for new supporting infrastructure [(e.g., electrical power, water distribution and wastewater collection systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), service roads, sidewalks, and parking, storm water management, force protection measures, site improvements, including landscaping, and informati on systems)] needed as a result of the development of Fort Belvoir.  Design for Transportation Systems: design activities to support development of multi-modal transportation systems needed to provide an efficient, secure transportation system meeting near - and long-term transportation needs of Fort Belvoir.  Conceptual Design of New Buildings or renovation of existing buildings: conducting all design activities necessary for capturing the tenant vision for secure and non-secure administrative, intelligence , medical, operational and training facilities and other community support facilities (e.g., child development center, recreational facilities) required to accommodate all organizations with non-specialized design and construction requirements that are mov ing onto Fort Belvoir as a result of the realignment.  The administrative buildings envisioned include administrative space, conference rooms, computer network and telecommunications facilities, support function and storage space, and visitor control areas .  The conceptual designs will be furnished to other AE firms responsible for the design of BRAC 05 projects.   Program Integration, Management, and Oversight. Program Management: supporting integration, management, synchronization and coordination of all activities associated with the realignment, including under other contracts.  These functional areas include master planning, environmental management, conceptual design support, communications, and facility operations.  Strategic Communication: developmen t and implementation of a comprehensive strategic communication plan structured to ensure that all Fort Belvoir stakeholders have accurate information and, when  appropriate, are solicited for their ideas and input on development activities.  Facility Operations: ensuring needed facilities and operations support functions are in place in time to support the realignment, new or renovated buildings, and tenant missi ons.  This requirement does not apply to the new DeWitt Hospital or the NGA campus.  For planning and conceptual design the AE firms must demonstrate, at a minimum, experience with these planning and design aspects:  Leadership in Energy Efficient Design ( LEED) standards and specifications;  The Sustainable Project Rating Tool (SPiRiT), with the preliminary designs meeting the standards required for a SPiRiT Gold rating; Applicable sections of the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) including, but not limit ed to:  UFC 3-210, Site Planning and Design, UFC 3-250, Vehicle Roadway Design, UFC 4-010-01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, and UFC 4-020, Engineering; Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS); Americans with Disabilities Act Acc essibility Guidelines (ADAAG); and other specified DoD and Army criteria relating to security engineering, design guidelines, and environmental standards.  As required under specific task orders issued pursuant to this contract, any construction cost estim ates will be prepared using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (M-CACES GOLD).  The Government will provide the M-CACES GOLD software.  Any designs or drawings will be produced in AutoCAD Version 2006 (or most recent ve rsion publicly available) and have the ability to be geo-referenced to the existing Fort Belvoir GIS.  All specifications documentation will be produced in SPECSINTACT using Unified Facilities Guide Specifications.  Design review comments and their respons es will be provided using the USACE Review Management System Proj/Net/DrChecks system.

<DESC>This previously announced sources sought notice is amended to extend the due date for submission of capability statements to December 7, 2005.  Nothing else has been changed.

Title:  Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (large business, small business, HUBZone, 8(a), Veteran-owned, small disadvantaged business, etc.) relative to the NAICS Code.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541519 with a size standard of $21 million.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from firms which have the capability to conduct the next phase of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) contract.

HCUP is a family of health care databases and related software tools and products developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership and sponsored by the AHRQ.  HCUP databases bring together the data collection efforts of State data organizations, hospital associations, private data organizations, and the Federal government to create a national information resource of patient-level health care data.  The participation of State Partners is essential for the success of the HCUP project and is based on cooperative, detailed agreements made between AHRQ and each data Partner.  The majority of States have programs in place to collect discharge records describing all hospitalizations within the State.  Increasing numbers of States are expanding their data collection efforts into the areas of outpatient care such as emergency room and ambulatory surgery.  Currently, there are 39 States with data organizations that currently participate as HCUP Partners by sharing their data with AHRQ.   HCUP involves many activities, a subset of these are achieved through a contract mechanism.

The current HCUP contract (Sept. 2000 – Sept. 2006) has expanded greatly from building State and national databases in earlier years.  The project now includes activities such as user support, electronic documentation, central data distribution, training, and expansion into outpatient data, among others.  As currently designed, the HCUP contract annually produces over 80 inpatient, ambulatory surgery, and emergency department state-level databases, 2 national databases, over 30 publicly disseminated databases, 10 software tools, and numerous presentations and trainings; receives over 500,000 hits per year on the HCUP Web site; and responds to approximately 2,000 technical assistance and data support inquiries per year.

The HCUP family of health services databases includes:  HCUP State databases – state-specific annual inpatient and outpatient discharge and visit level data files; HCUP nationwide databases – nationwide samples derived from the HCUP State databases enabling focused research on special populations; and other HCUP databases – auxiliary databases that are used to augment information in the HCUP State and nationwide databases.  These databases enable research on a broad range of health policy issues, including cost and quality of health services, medical practice patterns, access to health care programs, and outcomes of treatments at the national, State, and local market levels.  The HCUP databases are quite large in size.  The annual national database contains approximately 8 million records; the total of all the State inpatient records in a given year is approximately 32 million, and the total of all ambulatory surgery and emergency department records in a given year is approximately 16 and 17 million respectively.

Detailed descriptions of the project and data can be found at the HCUP Web site at:  www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov .

The next phase of HCUP will meet the following objectives in support of AHRQ’s mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare for all Americans:  create and enhance a powerful source of national, State, and all-payer health care data;  produce a broad set of software tools and products to facilitate the use of HCUP and other administrative data; enrich a collaborative partnership with statewide data organizations aimed at increasing the quality and use of health care data; and conduct and translate research to inform decision making and improve healthcare delivery.

The core component of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) contract is processing, and creating uniformly formatted State inpatient and outpatient encounter-level data files obtained from HCUP Partners.  Processing the data includes checking the quality of data received and developing additional analytic data elements from the source data.  The data are often derived from billing records; thus, they are often submitted in formats consistent with the Uniform Bill-92 (UB-92) and occasionally with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Form 1500 (CMS-1500) (although many of the statewide data organization deviate from these national standards in coding and data content).  HCUP purchases inpatient and outpatient (ambulatory surgery and emergency department) data files from the HCUP Partners.  

Once the data files are purchased from the State, the Contractor must process the data and create three uniformly formatted databases: State Inpatient Databases (SID), State Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD), and State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD) following existing HCUP formats.  HCUP nationwide databases are then created from the HCUP State databases by sampling hospitals across the participating States.  Currently, two types of HCUP nationwide databases exist: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and the Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID).  The NIS contains data on all discharges from about 1,000 hospitals located throughout the country, approximating a 20 percent stratified sample of community non-rehabilitation hospitals in the United States. The KID contains a sample of discharges from approximately 2,500 hospitals.

The HCUP Contractor will be required to conduct the following activities:

Manage the HCUP partnership’s data acquisition including recruiting new States into the project; requesting additional data types from existing HCUP State Partners; obtaining annual data files; and retaining Partner participation in the project.  These activities require completing data applications and supporting materials, and assisting in negotiating Memorandums of Agreement for participation.

Operate the HCUP Central Distributor, which handles all activities directly related to the sales and dissemination of the restricted access public release HCUP databases (the NIS, KID and a sub-set of the full State files used by AHRQ) and related HCUP files.  These activities include: maintaining a tracking and distribution system: answering general inquires about HCUP databases and related products; reviewing and processing data purchase applications; collecting and reimbursing fees from sales to Partners as appropriate; and making copies of the HCUP databases and files and preparing database binders.  

Provide HCUP Partners with technical assistance on their collection and use of their statewide encounter data to improve the collection and use of inpatient and outpatient data.  Topic areas include, but are not limited to, national standards for data elements in inpatient and outpatient encounter data, electronic transmission of encounter data, improved timeliness, edit checks and other data quality issues, adding clinical content and other analytically useful data elements to encounter data, and advances in health information technology that may lead to improvements in their data programs including the electronic healthcare record, Regional Health Information Organizations, and the National Health Information Network.

Provide AHRQ staff with technical support including access and use of data and documentation system, general technological innovations affecting HCUP data processing, and advances in health care information technology (HIT) relevant to HCUP.

Deliver user support by maintaining an infrastructure to provide technical support to outside users on HCUP databases, software tools, linkable files, written reports and all other products developed for the HCUP project.  The objective of the assistance is to increase the usefulness and use of HCUP data and products, and of administrative data in general.  Types of technical support to be provided include: explanations, applications and usage techniques of HCUP, its databases, software tools, linkable files, HCUPnet, and database and software documentation; answers to questions about appropriate use and reporting of data analyses; and procedures and requirements for acquiring HCUP databases and HCUP products.  User support also involves presentations designed and delivered to targeted audiences to increase their knowledge about HCUP; developing and implementing dissemination strategies; developing software tools that enhance the value of HCUP data and other administrative data; and conducting special research and policy analyses and preparing reports and publications which may be either descriptive, analytic, or methodological.

Maintain and further develop the HCUP Web site (HCUP-US) which serves as the project’s primary vehicle for public outreach, and a virtual repository for project information and documentation.  HCUP data is not stored on the HCUP-US Web site, but with few exceptions, all documentation components are archived in this system.  

Support the generation of estimates derived from HCUP data for the Congressionally- mandated reports:  National Healthcare Quality Reports (NHQR) and National Healthcare Disparities Reports (NHDR).  The NHQR provides assessments of health care quality at the national and State levels and tracks improvement across a broad array of quality measures.  The NHDR provides assessments of health care disparities related to racial and socioeconomic factors at the national level and within diverse priority populations and tracks the NHQR quality measures as well as an array of access measures.

<DESC>Solicitation number FA8101-05-R-0011 is expected to be released sometime between 21 Nov and 9 Dec 05.  The solicitation will be posted in its entirety to Fed Biz Ops.  The previous synopsis did not include the following information and is hereby amended to incorporate this information:

All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.  The solicitation/procurement data is approved for release ONLY to U.S. DoD contractors who are registered with the Department of Commerce Central Contractor Registration (CCR) site.

All interested parties are requested to respond with comments to the Contracting Officer, Michelle Shaw, at michelle.shaw@tinker.af.mil.  Phone calls are discouraged.



This office is currently in the early acquisition planning process for the follow-on contract for the Base Supply Function contract.  There are several issues that the Government is considering and the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to get comments from industry.  
First:  The Government believes that the NAICS code 561210, Facilities Support Services, adequately describes the scope of work to be performed.  The last contract was SIC code 8744, Facilities Support Management Service, and FSC Z999 Miscellaneous.  
Second:  The current contract was awarded through full and open competition procedures after a OMB Circular A-76 Cost Study and was not set-aside for small business.  The Government would like to consider some kind of small business set-aside and is interested to see what small business respondents are seriously interested in this acquisition.  Partnering and joint ventures are encouraged.
Third:  The Government would like to utilize a 10 year period of performance for the follow-on contract but is not sure that industry is able to have pricing information to account for costs during the latter years of the contract.  The Government will consider some type of economic price adjustment if industry can support the rationale or other recommended length for the period of performance.  The estimated value of the contract for the 10 year period would be $36M.
The solicitation number will be FA8101-05-R-0011.  There is no expected release date for the solicitation at this time.  The Contracting Officer may post a draft Performance Work Statement for comment on FedBizOpps.   The synopsis and formal Request For Proposal will be posted on FedBizOpps.  The information gathered as a result from this Request For Information may be considered market research.  It would be most helpful to provide your comments by COB 24 Mar 2005, however, comments to this RFI will be accepted until release of the formal RFP.
All interested parties are requested to respond with comments to the Contracting Officer, Michelle Shaw, at michelle.shaw@tinker.af.mil.  Phone calls are discouraged.

The mission of AASS is to develop and field products that enhance USAF  aircraft fleet availability and mission capability while reducing total  ownership cost. 2.  The objective of the Aging Aircraft Systems Acquisition Program  (AASAP) is to support the mission requirements of the Agile Combat Support  Systems Wing (ACSSW) and AASS by resolving the Air Force aging aircraft  system issues associated with operational support.  It specifically  addresses the sustainability of cross-cutting aging aircraft systems  throughout their life cycles.  It will result in improved technologies,  processes, parts and techniques for sustaining aging aircraft. 3.  The acquisition tasks associated with this program will include:  potential design changes, enhancements to maintenance procedures, and  associated problem resolutions and improvements that will extend the life  of the air vehicles.  The program will interact with the other aging  aircraft related programs to exploit lessons learned and new approaches.  Performance incentives (technical and cost/schedule) will be assessed for  specific application on a task-by-task basis. 4.  The AASAP is an approved small business set-aside.  The estimated  value of the AASAP is a ceiling of a $100 million over five years (FY06 -  FY10).

BACKGROUND:   The Human Engineering Development System (HEDS) is part of the Software Maintenance Group (309SMXG) located at the Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC), Hill Air Force Base, Utah. Among other responsibilities, SMXG supports all Operational Flight Program (OFP) modifications to the F-16 C/D Block 30 aircraft. HEDS is responsible for prototyping some OFP changes and then showing these prototypes in a flight simulator to pilots and a committee who make decisions about the OFP upgrades. The pilots and committee will be presented with several different images which require several projectors and a large screen. The images that are planned at this time include: 1) an OTW scene with HMD symbology; 2) a wide OTW view; 3) video repeats of two cockpit MFD displays; and 4) a birds-eye overview of the airspace where the pilot is flying the scenario. This system is a Non-Typical design and it must be designed and built to support more options as they present themselves in the future. The required IG computer system, dome screen, and Video Wall mentioned in the SOW are either purchased separately or are owned already, and are not themselves a part of the SOW. However; performance under the SOW will require some interfacing with those systems.

<DESC>Requested Input from All Interested Offerors:

The Government is requesting input on teaming/subcontracting arrangements for the SMC Technical Support (STS) contracts.  This acquisition will be based upon NAICS 541710 and the small business size standard is 1000 employees.  Please provide preliminary information on planned teaming/subcontracting arrangements, including size of your company and teaming/subcontracting members.  This information is for market research purposes only and does not serve as a commitment to the Government by any offeror of maintaining these arrangements at proposal submission.  

Requested Input from Large Business Interested Offerors Only:

Following award, large business prime contractors are required to assign an NAICS code, using the 2002 North American Industry Classification System coding manual, to each subcontract based on the nature of the work being subcontracted.  As previously published, the bulk of work against this contract will be under NAICS Code 541710.  The STS contracts will cover the following areas: Systems Engineering, Specialty Engineering, Developmental Planning and Support Engineering.
		
At proposal submission, large business will be required to submit subcontracting goals at a level they can reasonably expect to result from the Offeror expending good faith efforts to use small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business and women-owned small business subcontractors to the maximum practicable extent.  What does large business realistically expect to be an achievable overall subcontracting percentage goal for the STS contracts?  The Government expects to incorporate large businesses’ subcontracting goals as part of the awarded contract, and large business will be held accountable for meeting those goals.    

Given the above information, does large business see any opportunities for subcontracting, or does large business anticipate that most work can be achieved with little or no subcontracting (in-house)?  If large business believes there may be some limited subcontracting opportunities, please provide a realistic overall subcontracting goal.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center plans to procure services to support the efficient operation, high-impact utilization, and continual enhancement of NASA supercomputing resources to meet the growing, agency-wide requirements for large-scale computational modeling, simulation, and analysis, to support scientific and engineering excellence in NASA missions. The work will be performed primarily at Ames Research Center (ARC), Moffett Field, California. There could also be support at other NASA Centers during the performance period of the contract. In this synopsis, NASA ARC is soliciting information about potential sources and preferred contracting approaches for the above services, which are described in more detail in Appendix A (See separate Appendix A document posted November 21, 2005).  CURRENT CONTRACT FEATURES: The current NASA Information Technology Research, Development and Operations in Support of Scientific Computing (ITRDO) task order NNA05AC20T has the following features:  1) Period of Performance: Basic: 4/1/05 - 3/31/06; Option 1: 4/1/06 - 3/31/07. 2) Task Order Type: Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF). The task order was awarded under the General Services Administration Information Technology Omnibus Procurement II contract. I.  PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS  This notice has two purposes:  1) To request information on capabilities of potential offerors to provide the services described in Appendix A.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered by the Government and used for acquisition planning purposes only. 2) To request information from interested parties regarding their preferred contracting approach to providing the services described in Appendix A.   >From this point forward, the follow-on procurement to the ITRDO task order will be known as the NASA Supercomputing Support Services (NS3) contract. II.  SUMMARY OF PROPOSED WORK BACKGROUND: NASA’s challenging mission to explore and understand space and the Earth within it requires the agency to assertively leverage and advance humankind’s latest capabilities, technologies, and knowledge. Supercomputing is a powerful tool for meeting the agency’s challenges. Computing capability has advanced exponentially for decades, to the point that computational modeling and simulation has become an equal partner to experiment and theory in achieving scientific and engineering progress. Supercomputing now provides broad support in solving NASA’s greatest challenges, including high-fidelity modeling to design and improve aerospace vehicles, analysis of massive Earth systems data to understand potential near-term and long-term futures of our planet, and detailed astrophysical simulations to explore the history and future of our universe. To meet these and many other mission challenges, NASA operates two major supercomputing (a.k.a. high performance computing (HPC)) facilities. NASA’s primary HPC facility is the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Facility at Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. NAS serves as the supercomputing pathfinder for the agency, maintaining a deep knowledge of HPC and related technologies and applications, and developing and operating some of the largest, most effective supercomputers in the world. NAS supports users from most NASA Centers, all Mission Directorates, and external organizations as well. To enable effective use of these strategic HPC resources, NAS provides integrated support to its users, including application code porting and optimization, data analysis and visualization, application pathfinding, and system engineering. The goal of this integrated support is to achieve dramatic reductions in time-to-solution, demonstrate breakthroughs in accuracy or scale of solution, and enable unprecedented rapid advances in scientific and engineering insight. NASA’s second major HPC facility is the NASA Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. NCCS leverages the pathfinding of NAS to field and operate advanced and cost-effective production supercomputers. NCCS’ user base comes primarily from the Science Mission Directorate. However, both NAS and NCCS are able to perform load-sharing or fail-over services for the other facility if necessary. The NS3 contract will support the NAS facility, its HPC projects, and its NASA-wide networking infrastructure. NS3 may also support the NCCS facility, and perhaps smaller NASA HPC facilities at other NASA Centers, during part or all of the period of performance of the contract. NASA is transforming its multi-facility supercomputing resources into a unified, strategically managed capability for the Agency. Thus, approaches are sought that support coordination, best practices sharing, and other synergies across the agency. TECHNICAL AREAS: The following lists the technical activities at the NAS and NCCS facilities that may require NS3 support during the period of performance. These activities are summarized in Appendix A. 1) Supercomputing and Storage Systems 2) Networking and Communications 3) User Services and IPT Management (IPT Management is NAS only) 4) Application Services and Tools (NAS only) 5) Visualization and Data Analysis (NAS only) 6) Pathfinding Modeling and Simulation Technologies (NAS only) 7) Facility Operations 8) NASA-Wide Architecture 9) Program Management III.  RESPONSES REGARDING POTENTIAL SOURCES STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES Interested Offerors having the required specialized capabilities/qualifications to support some or all of the work described in Appendix A are asked to submit a capability/qualification statement of 15 PAGES or less.  The response must include the following: 1) Company name, address, point of contact, phone, fax, e-mail, and website (if applicable). 2) Whether your company is Large business, Small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a)set-aside small business, HUBZone small business, Woman-owned small business concern, Veteran-owned Service Disabled small business, HBCU/MI, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business for NAISC code 541519 size standard $21 million. 3) Your company’s capability in each of the technical areas.  For each technical area, indicate what percentage of the technical area you would perform. 4) Any experience that your company has in operating or providing primary support for a major supercomputing (a.k.a. HPC or high-end computing) facility. 5) A list of relevant work performed in the past five (5) years, including contract type, contract number, technical description, dollar amount, period of performance, and a customer reference name and telephone number.  Please include relevant work in collaboration with any high performance computing organization. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses.  IV.  RESPONSES REGARDING THE CONTRACTING APPROACH The Government is soliciting contracting approaches to the NASA Supercomputing Support Services contract that will enhance competition and provide business opportunities. Therefore, the Government is requesting feedback on the following areas for consideration during acquisition planning: a) Socio-economic considerations:  ARC is interested in your comments on establishing subcontracting goals for Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business, Small-Disadvantaged Business, or Women-owned small business concern, Veteran-owned Service Disabled small business, Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), and HUBZone small business.  The prior task order subcontracting goals were as follows: 	Small Business			12% 	Small Disadvantaged Business	10% 	Women-Owned Small Business	 3% 	HUBZone 			 0% 	Total Small Business Concerns	25% b) Performance-Based Contracting (PBC): ARC is interested in your comments on Performance-Based Contracting (PBC). If you have specific experience with PBC in support of similar contracts, please include your experience and opinion of measurable performance standards as it relates to the technical areas described in Appendix A.  c) Contract Period of Performance Duration:  ARC is interested in your comments on how long the total contract period of performance should be based on your ability to provide cost estimate information.  ARC is considering a contract performance period longer than five (5) years. d) Use of Cost Plus Award Fee/Award Term: ARC is considering the use of a cost plus award fee/award term structure to evaluate technical performance, schedule, and cost.   ARC is interested in motivating contractors to provide excellent performance during the life of a contract through a new incentive plan called "award term." Award term is considered a non-monetary incentive that can stand alone or be used in combination with other contract incentives.  It is a disciplined process used to determine whether to continue a longer-term business relationship with a contractor.  The award term evaluation process mirrors that of award fee; however, award term evaluations are based, to a greater extent, on objective metrics.  NASA has utilized this new contracting approach in several cases under a pilot program.  In an attempt to determine the feasibility of a cost plus award fee/award term approach for this particular procurement, the Government is soliciting input from interested parties and asks that responses include answers to the following questions:  1) Performance incentives: Please provide your view regarding award fee, award term, and/or other appropriate incentives for contractor performance. 2) Here are some sample incentive evaluation factors. How would you propose to measure factors such as the technical/cost/schedule performance, risk mitigation, employee and asset safety and security, innovative best practices, quality of service to users, extraordinary mission impacts, multi-facility synergy, bringing in new customers and users, responsiveness to changing requirements and budget, partnering with HPC vendors for new system development, or identifying opportunities for technical and administrative improvement? 3) What type of award fee evaluation factors would you recommend for this type of procurement?  4) What type award term factors would you recommend for this type of procurement? 5) Would use of an award term incentive properly motivate contractor performance on the follow-on contract and why?  6) Would you submit a proposal if a solicitation is issued for the follow-on contract with the award term incentive and why?  7) Have you had experience with Award Term Contracting? If yes, please provide the name of the Government agency who awarded the contract, the contract number, a brief description of the work, the Contracting Officer's contact information, and your perception of whether this did or did not incentivize performance.  e) Data: What type of technical information along with the Statement of Work would you like to see with a potential solicitation (e.g., sample tasks, information on the computer systems and other major resources currently being supported, best practices questions)? f) Contract Content/Structure: Do you have any suggestions or examples of restructuring, simplifications, and clarity in the description of technical areas (Appendix A) as well as other types of additional information that would improve understanding or clarity of requirements and terms and conditions? There is no limit on the page length to your response to PART IV. RESPONSES REGARDING THE CONTRACTING APPROACH. V.

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for the Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development and Mission Concept Studies NASA Research Announcement NNH05ZDA001N-ASTID under the OSS ROSES 2005 Solicitation.	Note:  Although a previous LaRC teaming opportunity under this ASTID NRA closed on November 16, 2005, this is a new specific teaming opportunity for “Solid-state Raman Spectrometer”.    Description: NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC)is seeking other government agencies, industry, academia, nonprofit organizations, and Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) partners for the Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development and Mission Concept Studies NASA Research Announcement (NRA) (see  http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId=  {614C2109-0768-07EF-D96F-32627F1BD24E}&stack=push  The ASTID program element requests proposals to develop instrumentation capabilities that will help meet Astrobiology science requirements on future space flight missions, as well as unique Astrobiology science objectives on Earth. Selected activities are expected to advance the development of scientific instruments or instrument components to the point where the instruments could be credibly proposed in response to future flight opportunity announcements, although proposals to build flight-qualified hardware are not a part of this program element. In addition, the development of laboratory instruments designed to open a new area of study for Astrobiology will also be considered. In addition, this program element also solicits proposals for Astrobiology mission concepts that may help increase the pool of ideas that may be considered for mission planning, as well as take advantage of mission opportunities such as offered by NASA’s Discovery( http://centauri.larc.nasa.gov/newfrontiers/  ).  Pending the approval of NASA's Fiscal Year 2006 budget, approximately $6M may be available for this year’s support of selections for the ASTID program. Awards are expected to range from $30K to $300K per year, for a maximum of three years. For mission concept studies, approximately 5-7 studies may be selected for funding, each at the level of $100K - $150K. For additional information on the scientific goals and objectives of NASA’s Astrobiology program refer to the Astrobiology Roadmap, which is available on the Astrobiology web site at  http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap  .  LaRC is seeking partners to participate with a NASA LaRC Principal Investigator (PI) in the ASTID Program to develop a proposal and assist with instrument definition and development. This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide the instrument components consistent with the efforts synopsized for the specified LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel. This criteria evaluates the proposer’s relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included.  (2) Cost and schedule control.	This criteria evaluates the proposer’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.  (3) Facilities.  This criterion evaluates the proposer’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  Specifically, NASA LaRC is seeking partners to participate with the NASA LaRC Prinicpal Investigator (PI) in the ASTID Program to develop a proposal for the following:  Solid-state Raman Spectrometer; Technical Point of Contact: Narasimha S. Prasad, 757-864-9403, narasimha.s.prasad@nasa.gov  LaRC is actively involved in the development of laser induced fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy based instrumentation for use on future planetary and space exploratory missions for remote as well as in-situ identification and analysis of biomarkers.  Recent studies on a Martian meteorite have kindled interest in the possibilities of past life on Mars. Currently, LaRC is working on the state-of-the-art Raman spectrometers operating over deep-UV to near-IR spectral bands for analysis of potential complex biomarkers including simple and complex pre-cursor inorganic molecules.  We are also interested in the development of reliable spectrometer configurations that could provide highest possible specificity and sensitivity in a compact self-contained architecture.	For this specific proposal, LaRC is interested in the development of novel, ultra-compact, all-solid-state, near-monolithic Raman spectrometer configurations for in-situ analysis suitable for Rover type platforms that provides reasonable sensitivity in visible to near-IR spectral band. Incorporation of remote analysis capability for redundancy and un-ambiguous identification of the molecules for extreme specificity is encouraged. Modularity for multi-functionality will be considered a plus. The design concepts should incorporate space flight qualifying criteria like size, weight, energy need, ruggedness through reliability/redundancy, etc. LaRC is interested in partners with the capability of designing and developing novel Raman spectrometers and assisting in the evaluation of their use in biomarker identification and analysis as well as participating in the development of the formal proposal to the ASTID Solicitation.   Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses shall be submitted electronically via e-mail by 5:00 local time, November 30, 2005 to: F. Wallace Harrison, at Fenton.W.Harrison@nasa.gov  Technical Questions should be directed to Narasimha Prasad at the email address above, or 757-864-9403. Procurement questions should be directed to: Nancy Sessoms via e-mail at Nancy.M.Sessoms@nasa.gov or (757) 864-2471; or in her absence to: Liliana J. Richwine via e-mail at Liliana.J.Richwine@nasa.gov or (757) 864-2478.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement to request submissions from companies who have the ability to mechanically seed in aquatic environments.  The U.S. Army Cops of Engineers, New England District will perform habitat restoration at the Ninigret Pond, Charlestown, Rhode Island.  The purpose of this habitat restoration project is to restore submerged aquatic vegetation, in the from of eelgrass, to the flood tidal shoal of Ninigret Pond, Char lestown, RI.  About 40 acres of the flood tidal shoal will have been dredged under separate contract to a depth of about 0.75 meters (2.5 feet) below MLW.  Eelgrass will be restored in the dredged restoration areas through a combination of direct planting and seeding methods.  The restored beds will be planted in mosaics of patches (at a 0.5 ratio) throughout the restoration area to mimic natural beds and to allow the beds to coalesce through succession.  Monitoring of the effort (by the Corps) will take pl ace for two consecutive growing seasons to ensure success of the project.  As part of this restoration effort, the mechanical seeding of eelgrass seeds is required to plant approximately eight and a half acres of subtidal estuarine bottom using 'An Underwa ter Seagrass Seeding Machine.'  The only known machine capable of performing this type of work has been developed and patented by The University of Rhode Island.  Seeds would be required to be harvested from nearby eelgrass beds and placed in appropriate h olding facilities (a flow-through seawater system with physical variable controls) for maturation.  Upon ripening, eelgrass seeds would need to be collected from the holding facility and prepared for planting (i.e., incorporated in to a gel matrix to make the seeds negatively buoyant).  The 'Underwater Seagrass Seeding Machine,' a combination of a pumping system and mechanical sled, would be used to pump and sow the eelgrass seed/gel matrix into sediments.  Interested parties with similar type equipment and  materials should submit a written notice to this office demonstrating your technology and experience to mechanically seed in aquatic environments.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or  an announcement of a solicitation.  Responses are required no later than 5 December 2005.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN: David Dilks (Contracts Bra nch).  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation, in one original form and one copy.  Responses shall be limited to 5 pages and shall include your small business status, if any.  The government will not pay for any material provided in respons e to this market survey nor return the data provided.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Business Opportunities and Company Eligibility for U.S. firms with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
<DESC>U.S. industry may use a number of avenues in seeking business opportunities associated with NATO. These include pursuing International Competitive Bidding (ICB) opportunities through the U.S. Department of Commerce as well as non-ICB opportunities directly with the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA); the NATO Consultation, Command, and Control Agency (NC3A); the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE); and the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT).

NATO assets are increasingly deployed in support of projects related to peacekeeping and humanitarian activities in Crisis Response Operations (CROs) theaters such as Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. As a result, NATO is pursuing many projects associated with CROs and peacetime operations and using NAMSA, NC3A, SHAPE, and SACT as the primary procurement agencies.

FINDING AND QUALIFYING FOR INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING (ICB) OPPORTUNITIES 

For projects with a value greater than 136,000 Euro (indicative amount, reference to NATO Procurement Directives), the NATO alliance uses the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement process to aid in the timely implementation of projects, to foster an environment conducive to maximizing the participation of qualified firms, and to avoid discrimination against firms of participating nations. The ICB process is the standard method of procurement, although waiver exceptions may be granted when appropriate, such as for emergency requests or operational justifications to support CROs. The majority of NATO projects that the U.S. Department of Commerce advertises are conducted under the process of ICB.

The U.S. Department of Commerce advertises those procurements that require ICB on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. (Select Department of Commerce - Bureau of Industry and Security.) The Department also issues Declarations of Eligibility on behalf of U.S. firms that qualify to bid on ICB procurements. To apply for eligibility, please complete the application available at the following website: http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm and submit it to Lee Ann Carpenter lcarpent@bis.doc.gov (Phone 202-482-2583) or David Newsom dnewsom@bis.doc.gov (Phone 202-482-7417).

OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE NATO MAINTENANCE AND SUPPLY AGENCY (NAMSA)

The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) is the principal logistics support agency within NATO. NAMSA assists NATO nations by organizing common procurement and supply of spare parts and by arranging the maintenance and repair services necessary for the support of the various weapons systems in their inventories. This assistance is available whenever two or more nations operate the same system and use NAMSA support facilities. The main areas in which NAMSA is involved are supply, maintenance, procurement, contracted management, and engineering/technical support. 

NAMSA does contract for goods and services through the ICB process.   However, the majority of NAMSA procurements are awarded to firms that are registered in the Source File, a database of suppliers. The Source File maintains information on vendors that  provide the services, equipment, and commodities that are procured by NAMSA on behalf of NATO collective forces such as supplies, repairs, weapons systems and components, ammunition, demilitarization equipment, security items as well as road repair materials and food and laundry supply services. NAMSA often contracts with registered vendors in its Source File to support CROs.

Firms interested in registering with the NAMSA Source File are encouraged to visit the following website: http://www.namsa.nato.int/suppliers/source_e.htm

The NAMSA website also provides future supply and service opportunities, which are amended and updated on a daily basis at: http://www.namsa.nato.int/suppliers/fut_opps_e.htm

Current Requests for Proposals are also published and available at: http://www.namsa.nato.int/suppliers/rfp_frameset_e.htm

The regulations governing NAMSA procurements are available at: http://www.namsa.nato.int/Suppliers/gen-prov_e.htm

OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE NATO CONSULTATION, COMMAND, AND CONTROL AGENCY (NC3A)

The NATO Consultation, Command, and Control Agency (NC3A) is the principal agency involved in the research and development, procurement, and implementation of C3 capabilities within NATO. It procures technology that can support the objectives of its NATO member nations, partner nations, and CROs.

As well as offering opportunities to industry under ICB, NC3A is increasingly pursuing Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) with qualified firms. BOAs are negotiated agreements with a supplier for a specified range of goods and services. As with the NAMSA Source File, NC3A BOAs provide blanket eligibility for firms interested in pursuing future bidding opportunities.  

Firms interested in negotiating a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) are encouraged to visit the following link: http://boa.nc3a.nato.int/

For additional information regarding NC3A, please visit http://www.nc3a.nato.int/

OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE SUPREME HEADQUARTERS ALLIED POWERS EUROPE (SHAPE)

Firms may also seek to register with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), which administers all CROs as well as peacetime NATO headquarters. To learn more about registering in the SHAPE Supplier Database, please visit the web site: www.nato.int/shape/community/budfin/index2.htm.

The site will provide information about Bi-SC Procurement Directive 60-70 and about open ICB. As SHAPE operates in a military hierarchy, the SHAPE J8/Purchasing & Contracting (P&C) Branch may relay your company information to the Joint Force Commands (JFCs) located at Naples, Italy; Brunssum, Netherlands; or Lisbon, Portugal; or directly to the NATO Theatres responsible for the acquisition projects.
 
For additional information regarding SHAPE, please contact: paul.buades@shape.nato.int

OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER TRANSFORMATION (SACT)

Firms may also seek opportunities with the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT), which focuses on the military transformation of Alliance forces and capabilities, using new concepts such as the NATO Response Force (NRF) and new doctrines in order to improve the military effectiveness of the Alliance.

For more information regarding SACT, please visit http://www.act.nato.int/budfin/rfpmain.htm

The ACT command is co-located with United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) in Norfolk, Virginia; there is also an ACT command element located in Belgium. As SACT operates in a military hierarchy, the SACT J8/Purchasing & Contracting (P&C) Branch may relay your company information to the Joint Warfare Center (JWC) in Stavanger, Norway; the Joint Force Training Center (JFTC) in Bydgoszcz, Poland; the Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre (JALLC) in Monsanto, Portugal; or the NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC) in La Spezia, Italy.

Please note:  Each firm registered with a NATO agency is encouraged to keep its registration information current as failure to do so may result in missed bidding opportunities.

The new service is to be between an existing network hub at Warren AFB, WY and a new Air Force Space Command training facility co-located at the Wyoming Army National Guard Range near Guernsey, WY.

<SUBJECT>U -- Request for Information - USNA LEAD Program
<DESC>INTRODUCTION:  This Request for Information (RFI) concerns the United States Naval Academy (USNA) LEADERSHIP EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT (LEAD) Program.  The overall objective of the LEAD Program is to provide graduate education and preparation for talented, highly qualified Junior Officers to serve as Company Officers at the USNA and for continued future service in the Navy and Marine Corps.  The program develops students’ abilities to think critically and analytically, and focuses on the knowledge, skills, and abilities essential for understanding, designing, and conducting leader and team development.  Each Company Officer leads and mentors a company of approximately 150 midshipmen.  Company Officers are the Academy’s primary leader and team developers, responsible for developing midshipmen morally, mentally, and physically.  Company Officers coach, counsel, and motivate, teach leadership courses, and act as officer representatives for athletic teams and extra-curricular activities.  Company Officers apply the graduate education garnered in the LEAD Program in an organizational, midshipmen company setting.

PURPOSE:  Historically, the USNA LEAD Program has met its overall objective of providing graduate education through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between USNA and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS).  The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from accredited institutions about other potential program offerings that will satisfy the overall USNA objective of providing graduate education, while satisfying the specific objectives discussed below.  This information will be compared with the current (and any revised) program available from NPS.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:  Educational and programmatic objectives follow.  All educational objectives must be met as they are considered mandatory for the fulfillment and proper execution of the LEAD Program.  Programmatic objectives include several which are mandatory and others which are preferred, the latter being highly desirable but not considered mandatory for the proper execution of the LEAD Program.  Mandatory objectives are coded (M) and preferred objectives are coded (P).
   
Educational Objectives:

(M) Think critically - Develop students’ abilities to think critically.

(M) Think analytically - Develop students’ abilities to think analytically. 

(M) Leadership and motivation - Understand and apply leadership theories, concepts, and principles.  Understand theories of motivation and apply motivational techniques to individuals and teams.

(M) Develop individual midshipmen to be leaders of character - Analyze and explain individual and team behavior and performance.  Plan, conduct, supervise, evaluate, and revise individual developmental programs. Design, conduct, supervise, evaluate, and revise individual and team learning experiences.  Apply performance appraisal techniques.  Apply counseling techniques.  Understand and apply ethical theory and military ethics.

(M) Serve as a role model and mentor for midshipmen - Understand role modeling and mentorship.  Assess and revise role modeling and mentoring techniques.

(M) Develop interpersonal behavior, professional core competencies, and be aware of the world - Communicate effectively, both orally and in writing.  Develop public speaking ability.  Understand the value of maintaining knowledge of current events.  Be aware of what’s happening in the world.  Develop the ability to relate current issues and world events to the Naval Profession.  Understand and apply time management techniques.

(M) Create an environment that supports individual and team development - Understand the role of USNA in developing leaders of character for the Navy, both today and in historical context. Explain the effects of team and organizational phenomena on individual development and team performance.  Design, supervise, assess, and revise organizational socialization programs.  Apply team development techniques to enhance individual midshipman development.  Apply assessment techniques to evaluate the effects of team and organizational phenomena on individual development.  
Lead organizations through change.  Integrate organizational systems to enhance midshipman development.

(M) Understand educational processes in an undergraduate setting - Assist with and contribute to the design, delivery, and assessment of leadership courses and training events to midshipmen.  Teach effectively at the undergraduate level.

Programmatic Objectives:

(M) One year timeframe - Students complete a master’s level graduate education in a one-year period (i.e., 1 June – 31 May).

(M) Greater Baltimore–Washington, D.C. metropolitan area - Students are designated as “LEAD Fellows” and are assigned for duty at the United States Naval Academy (USNA) in Annapolis, Maryland.  The graduate education must be completed in the greater Baltimore-Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  

(P) The program should capitalize on educational opportunities (e.g., academic field trips, site visits, access to senior governmental, military, and private sector officials, etc.) endemic to the greater metropolitan Baltimore-Washington, D.C. area.

(M) Cohort based education - Approximately 15-25 students (i.e., Junior Officers) complete all phases of the program as a cohort.

(M) Cohort recruitment, selection, and composition -
The LEAD cohort represents the finest Junior Officers from the Navy and Marine Corps, and selection is highly competitive.  Cohort membership will be determined by USNA and will be based on a broad range of selection criteria, including performance as a Junior Officer, potential for continued future service, and undergraduate academic performance.  

(M&P) Rich graduate education experience - The LEAD Program is typical of resident ‘gold standard’ graduate education, master’s degree producing programs, to include the next four items:

(1)(P) University campus setting - approximately 40 – 60% of 
the cohort’s education will occur at a university campus setting.

(2)(M) Accessible professors.

(3)(M) Availability of university academic, educational, and 
computational resources.

(4)(M)	This is not a distance education program.

(M) Assimilation to USNA - Some range (i.e., approximately 40 - 60%) of the cohort’s education will occur at USNA facilities.  This will provide students with the opportunity to assimilate to the unique USNA culture.  

(P) Similarly, professors with some degree of military experience or background are valued.

(M) Maximum educational appeal - The program is conducted by an accredited, prestigious university of the highest quality and selectivity.  The perceived appeal of the university and the degree program attracts the highest quality Junior Officers from the Navy and Marine Corps to compete for admission.

(P) Ease of administration - The program is contractually simple to execute.  Some form of per-student, per-cohort, or other flat-fee obligation serves as the basis of the contract.  USNA will not incur per diem, travel, lodging, or other miscellaneous or reimbursable costs associated with delivery of the educational product.  

(M) Minimize costs - Programmatic costs will be mitigated but not at the expense of educational quality.  Quality and cost both matter.  Reduced tuition costs are expected to accrue because of the cohort-based, annually renewable nature of the program.

(M) Company Officer indoctrination and training session
Approximately one-week at the end of the one-year program will be dedicated to formal Company Officer indoctrination and training.  This training will serve to facilitate the LEAD graduates’ transition to new duties as Company Officers.  USNA is responsible for execution of this phase of the program.  Proper coordination between USNA and any contracted university is necessary for scheduling and execution of the training.

<DESC>On August 27, 2004, the President signed Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), entitled “Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors.”  HSPD-12 required the development and implementation of a government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for Federal employees and contractors.  As required by HSPD-12, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201).  Subsequently, NIST issued several Special Publications in support of FIPS 201 to enable interoperable implementations.  Additionally, NIST created a conformance test suite for PIV card applications and middleware to ensure interoperability.  Currently, NIST is putting together a proof of concept demonstration to show the interoperability of commercially available products that support FIPS 201 Part 2.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposers' Day Briefing
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) anticipates releasing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) at the end of November for the Large Area Coverage Optical Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) program.  DARPA’s LACOSTE program is seeking to develop extremely-wide field-of-view coded aperture imaging technology to support single sensor day/night persistent tactical surveillance of all moving vehicles in a large urban battlefield. The LACOSTE coded aperture imaging technology proposals should focus on achieving a very wide instantaneous field-of-regard (90 degree cone angle) using multiple simultaneous wide field-of-view (FOV) images. For persistent tactical surveillance, the coded aperture should provide 0.3 m resolution across a large coverage area (500 sqkm) while operating from a significant stand-off distance (20 km). Analysis of multiple optical designs has identified coded apertures using large-area addressable masks as uniquely capable of meeting the objectives within reasonable cost, mass, and volume constraints. In coded apertures, a structured mask of pinhole cameras is created such that the image from each individual pinhole falls across a common focal plane array (FPA). With a large-area mask centered above a small FPA, the pinhole camera structure opens as a lens in the desired look direction while the remainder of the mask remains opaque. Knowing the mask structure, the multiple images on the same focal plane are digitally deconvolved to form an image. This concept provides several unique and enabling features. Orthogonally coded masks allow multiple simultaneous images at arbitrary pointing angles. Grouping pinholes enables electronically switchable resolution. The coded aperture replaces optical gain with digital processing gain. A critical enabling technology is the adaptive pinhole mask where each pixel is: physically small, addressable (either independently or in spatially distributed orthogonal groupings), millisecond switching speed, sufficient MWIR transmittance, low power consumption, large-area manufacturability, and extremely low cost-per-pixel. DARPA intends to hold a Proposers’ Day Briefing for the LACOSTE BAA on 8 December 2005 at the Booz Allen Hamilton conference facility in Arlington, VA.  Attendance is limited to no more than 3 individuals per organization.  Potential proposers should indicate their interest by registration on the  https://enstg.com/signup website, the conference code is LAC15530.  All attendees at the Proposers’ Day Briefing must be pre-registered. The deadline for registering is 1 December 2005.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of  the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

 (End of clause) 
HSAR 3052.209–70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to purchase through sole source from Waters Corporation, 34 Maple Street, Milford, MA 01767, an Alliance high-temperature GPCV 2000 system that will permit the Library to characterize binding materials in magnetic media.  It is the Library’s understanding that the identified high-temperature gel permeation chromatograph is the only one commercially available in the U.S. that is capable of meeting the Library’s critical performance requirement for high-temperature gel permeation chromatography that also meets the following needs:  The overall design must have no more than a 36-inch wide footprint to allow its use in limited space inside a fume hood.  All instrumental components must be contained in compartments internal to the single-cabinet design.  These internal components must include those for solvent conditioning and delivery, and sample preparation/injection.  All detectors, which must include an integrated differential refractometer, a differential viscometer, must be housed internally.  There also must be an internal compartment for a laser light scattering detector that can be purchased at a later date and controlled through the same software that controls the instrument.  The instrument must be controlled through user-friendly, highly-developed software that includes an integrated relational database to provide digital storage of and access to data and other information related to the Library’s collection objects being analyzed.  It must include WindowsTM-based system menus and software Wizards to guide users through instrument and sample setup parameters; system menus and graphical displays that mimic indication LED’s on the main system; automatic storage of methods, sample sets, and raw data files to hard disk; a system instrument logbook; templates for standard and customizable reports; templates for standard and customizable data fields and calculations to minimize the need to export data to post-run calculation programs, while still maintaining the ability to export data and graphics to a variety of standard WindowsTM formats including WordTM, ExcelTM, and Power PointTM; the ability to monitor via software at least 10 system parameters in real-time such as refractive index, viscometer, and laser light scattering detector baselines; multiple column pressures, temperatures, and flow rates; and others; data reduction including molecular weight determinations based on light scattering, refractive index, and viscometry data; and be accessed remotely via a networked Ethernet.  The temperature control of the system must include a column oven that can accommodate at least six 500-mm columns simultaneously; and column oven, injector, and detector compartments that can be each programmed from ambient (+10 °C) to 180 °C with user-programmable temperature ramp-up and ramp-down.  The injector, valve, and sample system must have a set of automated inject, bypass and purge valves; an injector sample compartment with at least 24 sample positions that has an internal and fully automated ability to prepare to warm-up the samples, to spin-down and filter the samples at high temperature, to multiply inject each sample, to use 4-ml, 10-ml, and 7-ml vials, and to use 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 1000 µL injection loops; an available seal wash option for applications that use aggressive solvents; a solvent delivery system that has a flow rate precision of 0.075%; an integrated vacuum degassing to condition solvents; and a programmable two-channel valve for selecting two different solvents.  The detectors must have the following characteristics:  the differential refractometer must have a pressure relief valve for safety, and an automated reference purge, a LED light source with automated detection compensation, a thermally shielded optics assembly, and the ability to automatically zero the signal output for reducing noise and signal drift and for setting the baseline; the differential viscometer must have a multiple-capillary design; and a laser light scattering detector must be offered by the vendor that can be purchased at a later date and controlled through the same instrument software provided.  The safety features must include:  multiple solvent, vapor, and thermal monitoring functions to alert operators of possible workplace hazards; thermal insulation to make all external surfaces safe to the touch; full regulatory compliance including UL, CSA, CE, and C-Tick accreditation.  Service features must include:  vendor-provided local service, with service engineers local to Maryland to provide immediate on-site response; a one-year warranty on non-consumable items; unlimited telephone support must be available while under warranty; follow-up software training after on-site and start-up installation by a local vendor technical support person.  Any other company that, at the time of application, (1) is either legally incorporated as a U.S. business entity or capable of demonstrating through its business plan its intention to be fully incorporated as a U.S. business, and (2) believes its high-temperature gel permeation chromatograph can meet all the above equipment performance requirements can apply to the Library for consideration.

B. Program Overview and Maintenance of Multiple Office Relationships
With interest in HIV/AIDS growing, the HCS position is critical to the functioning of the U.S. Mission in making sure that clear, consistent information on the United States Government’s HIV/AIDS programs is available to Zambian policymakers and the public.

Although there are no direct supervisory duties associated with the HCS position, the incumbent shall work collaboratively with USAID SO teams, relevant U.S. agency representatives, and the U.S. Mission Emergency Coordinator to strengthen internal PEPFAR links within the U.S. Mission as well as improve contacts and promote better public relations with local press.  

The HCS shall collaborate with the U.S. Embassy’s Public Affairs Section (PAS), which has overall media and public relations responsibility for the USG.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of  the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: 

Commandant (CG-851)
2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606

HSAR 3052.209–70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b) (1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number S-WHARC-06-Q-1007 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The quotation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-06. This is an unrestricted acquisition using commercial item acquisition procedures in FAR part 12. The NAICS code is 481211 with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees.      

The U.S. Department of State, U.S. Embassy Guatemala Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) has a requirement for rotary air (helicopter) charter services to various locations within Guatemala on an as needed basis to support the NAS counter narcotic interdiction and eradication missions.   The missions may include, but are not limited to, observation and/or reconnaissance of poppy and marihuana areas, before, during, and after the eradication to observe effects of the interdiction and/or eradication process, to assist with DEA and/or host nation counter-narcotic task force units with follow-up investigative case work, and preparation for the next eradication operation.

The requirement is for an indefinite number of flights which the proposed contractor may be required to coordinate in as short a timeframe as 12-24 hours from a request. All flying is strictly during daylight hours and may range from 3 to 6 hours per mission depending on the mission. The requests may be during non-business hours (i.e. weekends, after hours or holidays). The government anticipates awarding an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with a base period of one-year from date of award and four one-year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the government. During the term of the contract, which includes the base year and all option years exercised, the government shall order, as a minimum, services in an amount of at least $10,000.00 USD and the maximum cumulative amount of the Task Orders issued during a single year will not exceed $1,000.00. The maximum dollar value for the life of the contract will be $125,000.00 which includes the base year and all options. Historically, the NAS has chartered from as few as one helicopter per year, to as many as five helicopters per year. 

The contractor will be required to have expertise and experience with FAA regulations, vendor certification (14 CFR 121,125,127,133,135 or 137 as appropriate), operated and maintained under provisions of 14 CFR 91,121,125,127, 133,135 or 137 as appropriate. The contractor shall provide all direct labor, material, transportation, supervision, aircraft maintenance and administration pertaining to the aircraft. When the government has a charter requirement, the contractor will be required to obtain chartered aircraft of varying sizes of a Bell 206B-3 Jet Ranger III and/or a Bell 206L-4 Long Ranger IV in order to accommodate the numbers of USG and foreign nationals needing to travel via chartered aircraft. The contractor must be capable of responding to requests for chartered aircraft services within 12 hours of a request. The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining satisfactory standards of employee competency conduct appearance and integrity and shall be responsible for taking such disciplinary action against the Contractor’s employees as may be necessary. Personnel assigned to this contract must be acceptable to the Government in terms of personal and professional conduct. Personnel working on the contract or provided by the contractor to provide services shall not disclose sensitive information, or violate security and safety regulations and procedures. If contractor personnel are not upholding standards of conduct or create conflicts of interest with the Government, the Contracting Officer (CO) will notify the contractor and the personnel shall be removed from working on the contract. Any such actions will be justified and documented by the Government.  Failure to pass the background investigation will preclude a contractor employee from working on the contract. 

Quoters must include the following in their written quotations:

1. Price quotation in U.S. dollars, stated as follows:
Line item 001: Firm fixed price per aircraft hour (base period, 1/21/06-1/20/07): $___
Line item 002: Firm fixed price per aircraft hour (option year one, 1/21/07-1/20/08): $___
Line item 003: Firm fixed price per aircraft hour (option year two, 1/21/08-1/20/09): $___
Line item 004: Firm fixed price per aircraft hour (option year three, 1/21/09-1/20/10): $___
Line item 005: Firm fixed price per aircraft hour (option year four, 1/21/20-1/21/11): $___

2.  Technical/organizational narrative that addresses the following criteria: 

(a)	the number of instances over the past two years they have contracted for chartered aircraft services. The quotation shall provide examples of experience providing these services. 
(b)	information/statistics regarding dependability and reliability of aircraft previously chartered by the quoter over a one-year period. The quoter shall identify specific examples of measures they have implemented to resolve and mitigate problems in the past when chartered aircraft they have obtained have failed to arrive/perform as required or contracted for. 
(c)	information brochures or pamphlets describing the quoter’s capabilities and services provided. 
(d)	information regarding general business relations, general history/overview of the company, and references for work completed for other government agencies. The price information shall list each aircraft, wait time on land and overnight stay with an hourly rate. 

3. Past performance:
