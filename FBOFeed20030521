<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure expert services on a sole source basis from Karoly Kasa, Hungary.  The Division of Specialized Information Services at the National Library of Medicine requires the specialized expertise of Mr. Kasa in implementing the ToxSeek distributed search engine to efficiently access toxicology and environmental health information. Historically, the Specialized Information Services Division (SIS) of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has been a centralized resource for accessing information on Toxicology and Environmental Health via the TOXNET system. The SIS TOXNET (http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov) software and databases are hosted on NLM/SIS servers. TOXNET content comes from SIS and NLM, as well as other government agencies and third-party sources. As such, TOXNET requires ongoing data conversion and regular updates. Increasingly, useful and reliable toxicology on environmental health information is available on the World Wide Web via Web-accessible databases outside of NLM/SIS. In order to continue its mission as a focal point for providing access to toxicology and environmental health information of high quality and currency, the Specialized Information Services Division is pursuing the development of a Toxicology and Environmental Health Portal system to provide distributed access to diverse toxicology and environmental health databases on the World Wide Web. Building on specialized expertise and work on software development to access heterogeneous databases on the Web and demonstrated implementation such software, the contractor will implement a Toxicology and Environmental Health Portal with the following capabilities:  1) Simultaneous access to internal and external databases to be specified by SIS, 2) Ability of the user interface to run on MS/IE 6.x and NS 7.x browsers on Sun Servers and PCs, 3) Ability to merge and rank results from different databases using sophisticated weighting and scoring algorithms, 4) Ability to automatically identify, extract and utilize relevant concepts from selected thesauri and retrieved documents, 5) Ability to customize  and integrate specialized Natural Languages Processing (NLP) tools and applications, such as spelling checkers into the distributed search and query processing application (e.g. specialized chemical name spell checking software), 6) Ability to customize and integrate part-of-speech taggers and natural language phrase parsers  into the distributed search and query processing application, 7) Ability of the software to monitor changes in heterogeneous databases and automatically reconfiguring access, 8) Ability of the software to run on multiple servers with automatic load balancing, 9) Implement, test and install IE browser toolbar to launch and interact with the distributed search software, 10) Implement, test and install browser client plug-in version of software, 11) Implement, test and install downloadable local server version of the software, 12) Implement, test and install log-file and access management and statistical analysis module. Special Requirements: The offeror must have minimum 5 years experience of high level Java software development and minimum 2 years of specific expert Java application development in distributed search engine implementation. A Master’s degree and/or Ph. D. in Computer Science or comparable work experience is required for this project. Mr. Kasa has extensive and highly relevant experience and documented successes in distributed search engine development using the Java programming language and he is thoroughly familiar with SIS’s existing search and natural language processing technologies. His specialized expertise and work experience will significantly facilitate the ToxSeek implementation effort. Mr. Kasa possesses the specific knowledge and expertise to meet SIS’s critical need since the Division does not have adequate in-house staff nor contractor pool expertise in the required specialized areas of software development to achieve the desired goals. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner in which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced book as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information. NLM Synopsis No. NLM 03-134/CYC.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Cara Y. Calimano, Office Automation Technician, NLM on (301) 496-6127.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure expertise services on a sole source basis from Dr. Antonio Zamora, Bethesda, Maryland. The Division of Specialized Information Services at the National Library of Medicine requires the specialized expertise of Mr. Zamora in implementing specialized spelling checkers (e.g. a chemical name spell checker), English language tagger and noun phrase parser to efficiently access toxicology and environmental health information. SIS Search Engines provide access to a variety of Toxicology and Environmental Health Databases.  Spelling errors in user queries, especially in chemical name searches, and the lack of semantic query assistance are known shortcomings of our present retrieval systems. Preliminary work has shown the feasibility and desirability of implementing specialized spellcheckers and parsers for operational development and deployment in SIS search engines in order to improve retrieval access and better meet the needs of our divers user community. Building on prior applied R&D work on specialized spellcheckers and parsers, and in collaboration with SIS and NLM experts, the contractor will a) enhance the SIS ChemSpell specialized chemical name spellchecker for the SIS ToxNet Search Engine and the SIS ChemIDPlus System and b) will refine and implement specialized noun phrase and verb phrase parsers utilizing the SIS AZ Dictionary and Tagger and Phraser prototypes and c) integrate WordNet and other resources into the SIS AZ Dictionary. The offeror must have minimum 10 years experience of high level Natural Language Processing software development and minimum 2 years of specific expert application development in special purpose spelling checker, natural language tagger and phrase parser applications. A Master’s degree and/or Ph. D. in Computer Science and/or comparable work experience is required for this project. Working familiarity with NLM’s UMLS NLP tools and the SIS AZ Dictionary and Tagger and Phraser prototypes are highly desirable. Mr. Zamora has extensive and highly relevant experience and documented successes in dictionary development and the design and implementation of highly efficient natural language taggers and phrase parsers. In addition, Mr. Zamora is thoroughly familiar with existing SIS and NLM natural language processing tolls and applications. His specialized expertise and work experience will significantly facilitate the ToxSeek and ChemidPlus implementation efforts. Mr. Zamora possesses the specific knowledge and expertise to meet SIS’s critical needs since the Division does not have adequate in-house staff nor contractor pool expertise in the required specialized areas of software development to achieve the desired goals.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for an airplane mass spectrometer science instrument system in support of the Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Survey (ARES) Program that is contingent upon selection of the LaRC ARES proposal under step 2 of NASA Office of Space Science Mars Scout Announcement of Opportunity (AO) 02-OSS-02, and the availability of funds.  The ARES mission extends and complements the Mars Exploration Program by addressing two critical scientific themes: Near-surface Atmospheric Chemistry and Crustal Magnetism.  ARES will obtain simultaneous, contiguous, and complementary measurements of the Mars atmosphere, surface, and interior at a scale not previously achieved.  Measurements will be obtained in-situ, near the Mars surface, and over regional scale distances, yielding scientific advances in our understanding of the nature and variability of the Mars atmosphere, surface and interior.  This mission is accomplished with a flight-proven airplane system in one of the most scientifically intriguing regions of Mars, the Southern Highlands. The airplane mass spectrometer science instrument system includes the design, fabrication, and testing of an engineering model, structural/thermal mass model and a flight model.  Additionally, the requirement involves trade studies, development of interface requirements, and support of mission operations.   Contingent upon selection of the ARES Program under the above AO, and upon the availability of funds, NASA/LaRC intends to issue a contract on a sole source basis to University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) for the ARES airplane mass spectrometer science instrument system and other requirements as defined above.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source".  UTD was competitively selected under step 1 of the ARES mission based on their extensive experience in the design and development of similar flight mass spectrometer systems.  Step 2 of this work involves the selection of a team under AO 02-OSS-02 for full development as the first Mars Scout Mission.  NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), along with teaming partner UTD, submitted a Step 2 Proposal as part of the Step 2 process. The step 2 selection is planned for August 2003.  As a current partner to NASA LaRC, UTD has played a key role in the development of the Phase A Concept Study Report (Step 2 proposal) and in the overall mission.  Successful development of the airplane mass spectrometer science instrument system is a key component of the ARES proposed mission and one of the baseline science instruments.  The results from the work performed by UTD during the ARES proposal development process will provide a significant knowledge base for the ARES mission and reduce the development and schedule risks.  UTD has extensive experience in the development and operation of mass spectrometer science instruments for space.	The combination of UTD experienced personnel and facilities provides unparalleled experience in the development of space qualified mass spectrometer instruments that will directly address the needs of the ARES mission. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  See note 22.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for two airplane visual imaging instruments in support of the Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Survey (ARES) Program that is contingent upon selection of the LaRC ARES proposal under step 2 of NASA Office of Space Science Mars Scout Announcement of Opportunity (AO) 02-OSS-02, and the availability of funds.

Measurements will be obtained in-situ, near the Mars surface, and over regional scale distances, yielding scientific advances in our understanding of the nature and variability of the Mars atmosphere, surface and interior. The ARES mission will deliver an airplane to Mars with an entry and descent system to perform an aerial exploration effort. Of the six critical scientific instruments are the context and video cameras to transmit and record real time, critical events such as the descent and flyover of the Martian surface. This video and camera design for the Mars flight will be low mass, high performance, compact, low voltage, meet specific resolution as well as field of view and spectral requirements. The airplane visual imaging system includes the design, development, testing and delivery of an engineering model and a flight model for the airplane.	This system includes both software and hardware elements.  Additionally, the requirement involves trade studies, development of interface requirements, and support of mission operations.   Contingent upon selection of the ARES Program under the above AO, and upon the availability of funds, NASA/LaRC intends to issue a contract on a sole source basis to Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS) for the airplane video and context cameras as well as other requirements defined above.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source".  MSSS was competitively selected under step 1 of the ARES mission based on their extensive and unique experience with the design and development of space qualified visual imaging systems for autonomous aircraft and spacecraft flight.  Step 2 of this work involves the selection of a team under AO 02-OSS-02 for full development as the first Mars Scout Mission.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for an airframe subsystem in support of the Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Survey (ARES) Program that is contingent upon selection of the LaRC ARES proposal under step 2 of NASA Office of Space Science Mars Scout Announcement of Opportunity (AO) 02-OSS-02, and the availability of funds.  The ARES mission extends and complements the Mars Exploration Program by addressing two critical scientific themes: Near-surface Atmospheric Chemistry and Crustal Magnetism.

This mission is accomplished with a flight-proven airplane system in one of the most scientifically intriguing regions of Mars, the Southern Highlands.  The airframe subsystem includes the design, fabrication and testing of an engineering model, structural/thermal mass model, flight unit, and atmospheric data system.  Additionally, this requirement involves trade studies, development of interface requirements, support of wind tunnel testing, high altitude drop testing, and mission operations.   Contingent upon selection of the ARES Program under the above AO, and upon the availability of funds, NASA/LaRC intends to issue a contract on a sole source basis to Aurora Flight Sciences (AFS) Corporation for the airframe subsystem and other requirements as defined above.   The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source".  AFS was competitively selected under step 1 of the ARES mission based on their extensive and unique experience with at least three significant Mars Airplane development studies that resulted in both definitive reports as well as flight worthy hardware that successfully demonstrated the capabilities of their respective airplanes.  Step 2 of this work involves the selection of a team under AO 02-OSS-02 for full development as the first Mars Scout Mission.  NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), along with teaming partner AFS, has submitted a Step 2 Proposal as part of the Step 2 process. The step 2 selection is planned for August 2003.  As a current partner to NASA LaRC, AFS has played a key role in the development of the Phase A Concept Study Report (Step 2 proposal) and in the overall mission.   The key risk element of the ARES mission concept is the extraction of the stowed airplane from the Mars atmosphere entry body, and the unfolding and deployment of the wings and tail to form a flying airplane.  AFS has successfully performed a demonstration of the initial stowing and deployment concept for the ARES mission in a test of a half-scale version of the ARES airplane.  This test represents the first-ever successful test of an airplane unfolding, deployment, orientation, and pullout maneuver in aerodynamic conditions.  This test and results from the work performed by AFS during the ARES proposal development process will provide a significant knowledge base for the ARES mission and reduce the development and schedule risks.  The combination of flight experience and the capabilities of AFS to design and develop airplanes are unique qualifications that directly address the needs of the ARES mission.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intend to contract on a sole source basis with IBM for the completion of the development and implementation of the National Medicare Utilization Database (NMUD) and the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS).  This is not a solicitation.  This is a notice of intent to contract with IBM.  CMS is using the exception to full and open competition described in FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii) to procure IBM’s services.  This exception to full and open competition allows the Government to contract with the original contractor for follow-on development of a major system.  IBM, through previous separate procurements, has developed the NMUD and MSIS, but significant effort remains to finalize the development and implementation of full versions of the systems.  Both systems are DB2 Very Large Databases (VLDB).  The contract will acquire IBM’s services to complete their development of the two VLDB’s and fully implement them in the CMS enterprise data warehouse architecture. CMS requires additional DB2 based functionality to be implemented before these databases can truly support CMS’s national-level, rigorous relational environments. The proposed contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition citing the authority provided by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii) has been prepared.    Interested parties must submit complete cost and technical information by the response date established above.  Email or fax responses are not acceptable.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be reviewed solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement, which is extremely unlikely considering the exception to competition that we are using in the JOFOC.  See Note 22.  Direct questions to Barbara Brunstetter at 410/786-7577.

<DESC>USAID/Peru hereby announces its intention to modify contract 
527-C-00-99-00271-00 with Chemonics International (CI) using the authority provided by FAR 6.302-1.  CI was originally selected through full and open competition to conduct  poverty reduction and alleviation and microenterprise and small producer activities under a level of effort (LOE) contract.  USAID/Peru refers to this work as the Poverty Reduction and Alleviation (PRA) contract.  The work involves business development activities in some of the most remote regions of Peru, including alternative 
development areas.  The learning curve has been extremely steep, including at one stage CI having to take over the activities of a non-performing partner NGO.  Under its LOE contract, CI initiated innovative, untested market development approaches that were recently independently evaluated.  In validated progress to date, the evaluation concluded that the PRA activities are poised for showing even greater promise, but that the initial estimates for project timing and budget were overly optimistic.  The current 
contract value is $16 million.  In place are multiple, fully staffed business centers and numerous formal and informal private and public sector activities and relationships.  Based upon USAID/Peru’s alternative development, trade and market competitiveness objectives – combined with the demonstrated expertise and success of the current PRA contract team – the 
Mission decided the activity should be extended but in the process converted to a performance based, completion type contract.  Such an approach will solidify learning curve results and allow all of the effort and funding invested to date to be directed towards achieving specific sales, investment and employment targets.  Achieving the desired completion state targets will involve an estimated additional four years plus funding of approximately $35 million.  The PRA activity is on-going.  It is not reasonable to believe that another implementer could insert itself into the activity midstream and achieve the results required.  For this reason USAID/Peru has determined 
that it is appropriate to obtain CI’s services under other than full and open competition.  Based upon the facts of the situation, USAID/Peru finds a reasonable basis for concluding that its minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique services available from an only source with unique capabilities.  
Accordingly, the services required are available from only one responsible source, no other type of services will satisfy USAID/Peru requirements, and FAR 6.302-1 applies.  This notice is being published to comply with FAR 6.302-1 (d)(2).

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, Alabama has a requirement for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services at Government medical (with limited non-medical) facilities in the continental United States (Zone 1), Alaska, and Hawaii (Zone  2), as well as overseas locations (Zone 3) to include Guam, Portugal, Turkey, Spain, Japan, Germany, England, Korea, and Italy.  The potential contracts will identify locations to be covered under the contracts by zones.  Zone 1 is CONUS, Zone 2 is Alaska  and Hawaii, and Zone 3 is OCONUS.  Small businesses are not required to propose on Zone 2 or Zone 3, but may propose on all zones if they so desire.  Offerors submitting a proposal for unrestricted awards must propose on all zones.  These O&M services wil l consist of those actions required to preserve and maintain government medical and non-medical real property facilities in such a condition that they may be effectively used for their designated functional purpose. Although this acquisition applies to med ical and non-medical facilities, the primary focus of this acquisition and proposal evaluations will be medical facilities. OCONUS medical and non medical facilities will be limited to less than 15% of the programmatic capacity. These services will include  scheduled maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, repair/replacement/renovation of facility systems and equipment, hospital aseptic services, grounds maintenance, pest management, medical equipment maintenance/repair, equipment inventories, condition assess ments, identification and or validation of problems/deficiencies, preparation of work plans describing method of correction/repair, actual execution of work plan to repair failed or failing medical and non-medical facility systems and equipment, implementa tion of automated maintenance management and CADD systems, facility management support, project management, minor construction within and without facilities, and other activities associated with operation, maintenance, and repair.  Facility systems will in clude all mechanical, electrical, architectural, utility, and site systems, equipment and components. These O&M services will include, but are not limited to hospitals, clinics, administrative, pharmacies, veterinarian, dental, training, research, plants, labs, and storage facilities as well as some non-medical facilities associated with these medical facilities.  Government medical facility maintenance/repair/renovation shall conform to the requirements of the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Health Ca re Organizations (JCAHO) Environment of Care Standards and other applicable codes and standards.  Fulfilling individual requirements for supplies and services will be achieved under the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 16.505(b) (Ordering ), by the implementation of task orders issued under the proposed contracts.   The proposed contract type is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), using firm fixed price (FFP) and time and material (T&M) task orders.  A single solicitation is  proposed for award of multiple contracts.  It is anticipated that five ID/IQ contracts will be awarded in an estimated amount of $375 million dollars.   The place of contract performance is the continental United States (Zone 1), Alaska, and Hawaii (Zone 2), as well as overseas locations (Zone 3) to include Guam, Portugal, Turkey, Spain, Japan, Germany, England, Korea, and Italy.   It is anticipated that three contracts will be unrestricted, and two will be set-aside for small businesses. The total value of all three unrestricted contracts will be approximately $225 million over the base year and four option years (3 contracts x 5 ye ars), and that the total value of both restricted small business contracts will be approximately $150 million over the base year and four option years (2 contracts x 5 years). Option years are not required to be exercised.  A unilateral modification will b e utilized to increase or de crease capacities on each of the resultant contracts (not to exceed the programmatic capacity of $375M), to accommodate program variables, contractor performance, and the requirements of Section 803 of Public Law 107-107 as necessary.  Teaming arrangements  and joint ventures between offerors are encouraged, if required, to provide the full depth and breadth of experience and capability required under this solicitation and resulting contracts.  Fair Opportunity requirements under Section 803 of Public Law 10 7-107 and implementing DFARS guidance will be utilized with award of task orders under the resulting contracts. The most applicable North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561210, paragraph b, Facilities Support Services, with a sma ll business size standard of $23M, exception 13.  The agency will apply FAR 52.219-14 on assessing whether a small business concern is eligible under a small business set aside. Offerors responding to this announcement shall reference DACA87-03-R-0009.  Th e solicitation will be released electronically through the Internet at http:www.hnd.usace.army.mil/EBS/AdvertisedSolicitations.asp on or about June 16, 2003 and will close 22 July 2003.

The Government anticipates awarding one contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to this synopsis/solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirements; Offerors shall present the technical methodology they would use in performing this project that would qualify them for consideration.  The technical approach will be evaluated on its feasibility, practicability, and appropriateness in accomplishing SOW requirements.  The offeror shall provide the following information:  Describe your knowledge and understanding of the requirement(s) as outlined in the SOW.  The technical approach must identify the methodology and analytical techniques you shall use to fulfill the technical requirements should clearly describe the following:  An overview of your proposed methodology in meeting the technical requirements identified in the SOW, the logical sequence of tasks that you will perform to accomplish the requirements, identify and describe the specific techniques and steps that will be applied during the accomplishment of all tasks of this project, the deliverables to be produced in response to project requirements, and describe your corporate qualifications capabilities specifically related to performance of SOW requirements. (2) Past Performance:  The offeror shall provide a minimum of one and no more than five references that best represents the best mix of knowledge and experience through relevant contracts.  For each reference, identify and provide contact information of those persons/customers most knowledgeable about the contract.  For Government contracts, provide current information for the Government Program Manager, Project/Task Manager, Contracting Officer, and Administrative Contracting Office.   Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each Offeror in his proposal and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past and present performance.  Under the past performance evaluation criteria, the evaluation of an offeror's present and past work record will be performed to assess the Government's confidence in the offeror's probability of successfully performing as proposed.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet user's needs, including cost and schedule.  Evaluation of the offerors past performance will be accomplished by reviewing aspects of an Offeror's relevant present and recent past performance, focusing on and targeting performance which is relevant to this effort.  A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, and/or teaming partners, will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror.  (3) Key Personnel:  As a MINIMUM, each proposed offeror will be evaluated based on whether they have the skills deemed by the Government to be necessary to minimize risk and successfully complete the requirements in SOW.

List personnel and skill level categories available to work on start-up date (include special qualifications of key personnel).

Individuals designated as key personnel will be committed to the project for its duration and cannot be substituted or replaced without the written agreement of the CO.  and (4) Price:  Offerors' price proposals will be evaluated to determine price realism and reasonableness.  Offerors are hereby advised that only those proposals determined to have a reasonable chance for award of a contract will be included in the competitive range.  While every effort will be made to maintain strong competition, the Contracting Officer will also look to eliminate time consuming and unnecessary discussions with those offerors whose proposals have no reasonable chance for award.  This procedure is considered beneficial to both the Air Force and the offerors involved since, in addition to saving further expenditure of resources, acquisition lead time should be reduced.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions.  The contractor shall provide at a minimum a spreadsheet listing all labor categories, hourly rates and extended labor costs.

Date for receipt of proposals:  Monday, July 14, 2003

The National Transit Institute is seeking proposals to procure personnel resources to create a CD-ROM using distance leaning technology to help train National Transit Database (NTD) reporters.

The NTD is the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) national database for statistics on the transit industry.  Annual NTD reporting is a statutory requirement for about 600 urban transit authorities that receive FTA grants.  NTD data is used in statutory formulas to apportion about $4 billion in FTA funds back to these 600 urban transit authorities across the nation.  The NTD also provides Congress and millions of transit riders with data on the Safety and Security of the nation’s transit systems.

This course will be based, in part, on the current 2003 NTD Reporter’s Manual, which contains reporting for both the Annual NTD and Safety and Security.  This CD training course will also be based on the current NTD training manual and the training materials used in the current NTD training program.  The current NTD training program is approximately a 12-hour instructor-led training program, The 2003 National Transit Database Annual Reporting Module.   There is a second, 6-hour course, that is instructor-led, on The 2003 National Transit Database Safety and Security Reporting Module.  The subcontractor is expected to take the content presented in these courses and design and produce an interactive CD-ROM version.    

The NTD CD-ROM training will be offered to urban transit authorities that receive FTA grants.  

To obtain a copy of the complete RFP, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement and Contracting address above.  Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted.  Telephone requests are unacceptable.  RFP’s will not be faxed.  Requests will be honored if received by June 12, 2003.  RFP’s will be mailed out shortly thereafter. Rutgers University is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to provide opportunities to small businesses, minority-owned businesses and/or female-owned businesses.  These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.

<ARCHDATE>07052003
<CONTACT>DENIS S. THARP, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2092, E-Mail: Tharp.Scott@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) is in need of portable on-vehicle emission measurement devices within sixty (60) days of award, from hereon referred to as Portable Devices (PD). The PD's shall independently quantify total oxides of nitrogen (NOX); carbon monoxide (CO); carbon dioxide (CO2); total hydrocarbons (THC); non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC); fuel-air ratio; exhaust flow rate; fuel economy; ambient and exhaust temperatures; pressures; relative humidity; CAN/ECM signals; GPS signals and have the ability to simultaneously measure emission concentrations from two different locations of the exhaust (i.e. upstream and downstream of exhaust after-treatment systems).  EPA's performance goal is that each of these parameters be quantified at 1 Hz by exhaust mass rate, g/kg of fuel consumed, g/mile, and g/hp-hr.  EPA's accuracy goal is +/- 10% with 95% confidence on brake-specific (g/hp-hr) and distance-specific (g/mi) bases as compared to simultaneous certified laboratory results over the full range of steady state and transient engine operation. EPA will consider a single PD unit applicable to diesel and gasoline engine applications.  However, EPA recognizes that diesel and gasoline engines emit very different concentrations of emissions and that lean (diesel) and stoichiometric (gasoline) exhausts might require different emissions measurement technologies.  These differences are elaborated upon in the Statement of Work.  EPA will also consider responses that propose alternatives to a single PD solution.  Such solutions might include a single unit with modular components that can be added or removed depending upon a diesel or gasoline application.  Another possible solution would be two complete, but separate systems:  one for gasoline and one for diesel. This PD will be subject to acceptance criteria detailed in the Statement of Work to determine th effort required to prepare and maintain the PD for testing exhaust emission from vehicles and engines, to collect simultaneous emissions and activity data during laboratory testing using CFR analytical procedures for purposes of correlation analysis, to simulate in the field laboratory driving schedules, to correlate PD road and lab data and field test the PD over a sufficient period of time and range of operation to judge its durability and data quality.  The PD will also be compared to EPA's ROVER system during real-world in-use driving conditions. The successful offeror must have the capability to provide excellent support, service and training in order to maximize the system's utility.  EPA requires the successful offeror to provide a one-year warranty that includes, at a minimum, expert telephone support during normal business hours and complete repair or replacement of any failed components within five (5) business days of return to the contractors' facility.  The warranty shall include parts, labor, and shipments of failed and replacement components for a period of 365 days from system delivery. This award will require the delivery of PD systems capable of gasoline (Minimum 6, Maximum 16) and diesel emissions measurement (Minimum 1, Maximum 10), plus any accessories that might be required to field-calibrate, operate, and maintain the units. The PD systems must be compact, and the attachment, connections, and packaging must ensure that the system will be non-intrusive and quickly installable and removable. EPA requires that the product weigh less than 50 lbs and will be about the size of a hand-carried toolbox so that one person can carry it to a vehicle.  The attachment of the system to the vehicle must be straightforward and it must require a minimal amount of tools or other hardware.  Connections to exhaust and engine components must be non-intrusive and low profiles so that the system will not interfere with the operation of the vehicle.  Electrical connections must be able to withstand outdoor environments.  The attachment, connections, and packaging must be able to withstand vehicle shock and vibration and temperature changes on-vehicle.  The system must be able to tolerate typical handling during installation and removal. This procurement is a small business set-aside under NAICS Code 334519 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Award will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria. The solicitation should be issued by June 6, 2003 on EPA website http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  Please contact EPA Contract Specialist, Scott Tharp at (513) 487-2092 or through e-mail at Tharp.Scott@epa.gov regarding any questions to this synopsis.  This office doesn't intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  See Note 1.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Microbial characterization in ground water is typically done by sampling the groundwater at desired locations.  However, it has been shown that the number of microorganisms collected free-floating in a water sample bears little relationship to the size of the population adhered to the subsurface strata.  Existing methods for getting around this problem are expensive and time consuming.  This technology, the biofilm coupon, is a device for accurately measuring, in situ, the population and growth rate of biofilm-forming microorganisms in water, particularly subsurface groundwater.  The device consists of a cylinder with porous walls and end caps.  The cylinder is packed with a material such as glass beads upon which the biofilm microorganisms are permitted to grow.  After a period of time, the biofilm coupon can be withdrawn and the microbial growth measured.  One use of the device is to monitor bioremediation progress in groundwater by monitoring the status of the microbial population in the water.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Pacific Northwest National Laboratory researchers have developed technology for encoding high-density data using an optical technique.  The technology involves a readout and encoding scheme that permits the permanent storage of data in grayscale in physical dimensions of well under 1 micron.  Grayscale encoding permits storage of multiple bits of information at each storage location and dramatically increasing storage densities.  Estimates of potential storage densities are 10 times those of a DVD.  A laboratory demonstration of direct alphanumeric encoding was accomplished with 2.5 micron letters and 250 nm thick lines.  The readout of the data can be accomplished using inexpensive light sources and CCD devices.  Other potential advantages of the media are robustness of storage and high data transfer rates.  Media lifetimes are potentially thousands of years making this a candidate for data archiving.  Data transfer rates are estimated at 1014, exceeding even holographic storage.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>RFQ 72663  CDE Harmonization Vendor Questions / May 19, 2003 1.   Reference Paragraph 7.1; "Government shall provide all contractor personnel with access to caDSR server resources." Will onsite and offsite contractor personnel have access to the caBio network during normal working hours?    Government Response:  Yes, access will be provided to both onsite and offsite contractor personnel. 2.   Reference Paragraph 7.1; Does access to the caBio network include access to caCORE, caDSR, and EVS (Enterprise Vocabulary System)?  Government Response:  Yes, access to all systems will  be available. 3.   Reference Paragraph 7.1;"The Government shall provide workspace, office equipment and supplies, a PC, and network connectivity for one full time equivalent."  Will onsite contractor personnel have Internet access?    Government Response:  Yes, network connectivity includes Internet access. 4.   Reference Paragraph 7.1; Will the Government provide onsite contractor personnel with an email account? Government Response:  An email account can be provided upon request. 5.   Reference Paragraph 6.1; "The government anticipates 2 conferences per year."  If there are conference registration fees, will the government pay the registration fees for contractor personnel or reimburse the contractor as an ODC?     Government Response:  Fees will be reimbursable for conferences for which attendence has been approved by the Project Officer. 6.   Reference Paragraph 4.4, Section 7; "CDE Harmonization Report, due in writing with accompanying verbal presentation 30 days prior to expiration of the contract period of performance."  Will the government specify file graphic presentation format requirements and make the presentation software available to contractor personnel?    Government Response:  The written report is expected to be delivered in MS Word or compatible format.  The verbal presentation is expected to include an MS PowerPoint presentation.  The government will provide MS Word and MS PowerPoint on the PC that is allocated to the onsite FTE. No desktop computers or office software will be made available to off-site contractor personnel. 7.   Reference Paragraph 17.0; "The contractor shall send all invoices directly to GovWorks at the address indicated below." Will the Government accept electronic delivery of monthly invoices and all supporting documentation in a Portable Document Format (PDF) in lieu of sending the invoices through regular mail?    Government Response:  Yes, if it is sent to the email address as indicated in the Government sow. 8.   Did the EDRN use any other metadata repository for development and registration of the CDEs that are to be turned over to DCP?    Government Response:  EDRN developed their own metadata repository using a different architecture than the caDSR, but which is still compatible with the ISO/IEC 11179 standard. 9.   Please explain the split in the accountability of the selected contractor to the Context Administrator within DCP for the EDRN CDEs(first objective) and to the Context Administration community at large to meet the second and third objectives of the SOW. 	Government Response:  The contractor is ultimately accountable to the NCICB Project Officer for all objectives of the SOW.  The vendor will have to form working relationships with DCP personnel to accomplish the first objective successfully, and with all the Context administrators to accomplish the second and third objectives successfully. 10.  Is there an incumbent contractor at DCP for this same type of work albeit for a different context administrator within the DCP?    Government Response:  This RFQ is being issued for free, open and equal opportunity competition. 11.  Are we correct to assume that Oracle is already performing this function for other departments within NCI managing other contexts and are therefore the preferred vendor?	Government Response:  This RFQ is being issued for free, open and equal opportunity competition. The present contracts at NCICB regarding the caDSR primarily cover software development and maintenance and not CDE development and harmonization. 12.  Is the NCI working against any baseline or draft methodology or process for NCI CDE harmonization that is to be reengineered or improved?    Government Response:  The Context administrators have indeed begun discussions about CDE harmonization. The contractor is expected to pick up on that discussion and help move things forward more rapidly and formally. 13.  Can we assume that no prior work has been done anywhere in NCI for the use of the Conceptual Domains feature?    Government Response:  A limited number of Conceptual Domains have been assigned by the individual Context Adminstrators.  However, this effort has been sparse and scattershot, and no concerted systematic effort has taken place.

This solicitation is issued sole source to The University of South Car olina (USC) Department of Mechanical Engineering, 516 1/2 South Main Street, Columbia, SC  29208-0001 in accordance with FAR 6.302-3.  USC is the desired source to perform the value engineering and cost benefit analysis of the AH-64 and UH-60 onboard vibra tion monitoring system due to their established expertise in this area.  The contractor, USC, will evaluate the cost and effectiveness of seven AH-64D and fifteen UH-60A on-board Vibration Monitoring (VM) Systems, to provide an annual cost savings analysis  fleet that is currently located in Korea.  A Digital Source Collector (DSC) demonstration program will be conducted in order to demonstrate and show the operational merits and benefits of a DSC on Army aircraft.  The Vibration Management Enhancement Progr am (VMEP) system will be used as a DSC prototype system for this demonstration.  The Vibration Management Enhancement Program (VMEP) provides a means to perform automatic prediction, detection, and identification of helicopter mechanical faults.  The syste m monitors the health of the main rotor system, engines gearboxes, tail rotor drive system and accessories.  Advanced monitoring and diagnostics software based in neural network and other diagnostic techniques are being applied to the helicopter maintenanc e activities to identify and diagnose faults and potential faults.  Improvements in the Rotor Track and Balance (RT&B) maintenance will be provided with the use of non-linear data processing algorithms.  The VMEP system interfaces with the Maintenance Supp ort Device (MSD) for (at aircraft) faulty determination and maintenance recommendations.  In order to determine the operational merits and benefits of a DSC on Army aircraft a value engineering and cost benefit analysis will need to be performed for this on-board vibration monitoring system.   Period of performance is from July 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004.  The following provision apply:  FAR 52.215-5 Facsimile Proposal, FAR 52.215-8 Ordering Precedence-Uniform, FAR 52.216-7 Allowable Cost and Payment, 52.216 Cost Contract / No Fee, Alternate I, FAR 52.216-7 Type of Contract.

In addition to the initial quantity of 4 each, we intend to solicit option quantities 4 each for a period of 3 years.  Expect to post Solicitation on or about 10 Dec 2002.  Response date of 4 Jun 2003 is tentative estimate of closing date.  This acquisition will be 100% small business set-aside. Data will be available when Solicitation is posted. This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a  legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD2345 with their request for solicitation.  To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC_FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department Defense Form 2345 or call at the above number.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time initially issued. Issuance of the RFQ will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition.  If your concerns are not satisfied by the contracting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman, Kathy Cames, at 478-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns. Point of Contact, Dorothy Shirley, Contract Specialist, LEKVB, PH: 478-926-7851X142

<DESC>SEE ATTACHED SOLICITATION AMENDMENT.  CLOSING DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED UNTIL COB 30 May 2003.  ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS NOTICE: This will be a firm-fixed-price type contract for Amplifier Subassembly applicable to the ALR-56C system; NSN: 5996-01-230-8671; P/N: 319751-000. Basic Qty: 2 First Articles; 33 Production Units. Mission Essential Quantity (MEQ): 30 Production Units.  Option I: 1-89 Production Units. Option II: 1-89 Production Units.  
This is a competitive requirement with an Insurance Policy Buy for the MEQ to the proven source, BAE Systems, Yonkers, N.Y. 
This acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5352.217-9006 (Award of MEQ): The Government has determined that a break in the supply of this item (that is, failure to deliver due to timeliness and/or conformance) would jeopardize support to operational units' mission capability. Additionally, the item is of such complexity and/or so critical that first article testing measures are required for all unproven sources to ensure that the unproven source is capable of producing a conforming part. Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award the MEQ and, if necessary, the remaining balance of the requirement, to a proven source. In such event, the proven source must be a responsive, responsible offeror and also be the lowest in price of all proven offerors, price and price related factors considered. Therefore, two contract line items are provided to correspond with each of the two alternatives.  
The approximate solicitation issue date will be 7 Feb 03, with the approximate response date of 7 Mar 03.  Request solicitation from Don Howard, WR-ALC/LNKB, 265 Perry St, Robins AFB, GA, 31098-1607; email don.howard@robins.af.mil.  Solicitation will be posted on the Web at http://pkec.robins.af.mil. All responsible sources solicited may submit a proposal, which shall be considered.
Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, may apply.  Numbered Note 22 applies only to the quantity identified as the MEQ.  See Note(s) 22, 26.

The dates for release of the drafts was delayed but the first of four drafts is now ready for review on the DCC-W home page at the following address: http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/services/RFP1.as p.	 This is one of four (4) planned draft RFPs for provision of Human Resource Services for the United States Army.

After release of the final RFPs there will be a pre-proposal conference at which the government will provide extensive information on the requirements and at that time the government will allow additional comments and questions. Technical point of contact is Ms. Susan Harvey at  Susan.Harvey@hqda.army.mil and the Contracting Office point of contact is Ms. Sue Kinsey at sue.kinsey@hqda.army.mil.

<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Aerospace Research Manufacturing Development Consortium Market Survey Narrative The Glenn Research Center is seeking non-profit sources for an Aerospace Research Manufacturing Development Consortium.  A key provision of the contract will be to provide, primarily, on site aerospace manufacturing research support to the scientific and engineering community at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio.  The work required under this arrangement is in support of the Center’s Aeronautics Base Program, Aeronautics Program and Microgravity Science Research Program.  The contractor will be responsible for the manufacture of developmental and prototype aerospace scientific and research hardware.  State of the art manufacturing knowledge is required in order to develop untried manufacturing techniques for the production of this hardware relying on highly interactive coordination between the researchers and manufacturing personnel in order to accomplish projects involving aeronautics and space manufacturing.	 For instance, some manufacturing technologies involved in this initiative are for the manufacture of research instrumentation devices that detect pressure, strain, force and temperature, prototype model development, advanced manufacturing technologies such as advanced sensor development and application related to Microsystems and hostile environments, other rapid prototyping technologies such as ultra high speed machining and metallic and non-metallic laser deposition systems.  The contractor is to develop unprecedented manufacturing methods and techniques to support and advance cutting edge aerospace research. The organization that performs this effort will be required to operate, to a large extent, from the Glenn Research Center due to the highly interactive concurrent engineering culture required to develop unprecedented advanced aerospace manufacturing breakthroughs and because of schedule and budgetary considerations.  It is acceptable that tasks issued under this initiative will be shared by a partnership network or consortium so portions of projects can be manufactured on and off site.  The supporting organization will be provided with some government furnished property (GFP) and access to the state of the art manufacturing equipment necessary to perform the functions stated above.  As equipment becomes obsolete the consortium shall be responsible for providing state of the art enhancements utilizing its own funds negating the need for the Government to provide the GFP in the future.  The possibility that enhanced use leasing of GFP to the consortium for commercial purposes may also be an option under this arrangement. The primary goal of the consortium is to provide a means of transferring government manufacturing corporate research knowledge to consortium members through participation in highly integrated NASA/consortium research teams.  The consortium should endeavor to establish and maintain, through its member organizations, the required capability, and make it locally available to GRC into the foreseeable future.  The Government envisions this development of sources for the future as being an important element of the organization’s effort.  Interested sources should have developed objective relevant criteria for membership including small disadvantaged businesses and a realistic plan for encouraging new membership.  The work is currently performed by civil service employees in the form of undefined developmental tasks requiring close collaboration with engineering technicians, engineers and scientific researchers.  The consortium must have access to personnel that possess quasi manufacturing engineering skills.  It is highly desirable that the key contractor personnel be affiliated with research and development programs of accredited academic institutions.  Another key element of this consortium is the immediate transfer of cutting edge manufacturing technology to member private sector and academic partners to expedite the return on investment.  The expected return is to grow the U.S. technology market in this area and thereby establish and maintain an essential capability locally available to GRC.  The Government is seeking a source that has an established seasoned network of resources in research and development type manufacturing that is a mixture of academia, government and industry.	Another important facet of this initiative is aerospace workforce development strategy.  There is a collective concern in the U.S. domestic aerospace manufacturing industry that the skilled human capitol required to perform research and development manufacturing is rapidly deteriorating.  A goal of this initiative is to develop a capability in the Northeast Ohio region of a highly skilled aerospace research manufacturing workforce.  This goal is achieved through training and participation by consortium members in highly integrated NASA research and development teams to implant the technology advancements in the local research and development market. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.	 Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).	Firms are encouraged to discuss their capabilities and the any technical questions with Casey Blaze, 216.433-2119, fax 216.433-3362, casey.a.blaze@nasa.gov.  Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to the above named person no later than 6-21-03.  Please reference the title shown above in any response.

<DESC>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), U.S. Department of Transportation has a requirement for the following services. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to seek information regarding the feasibility of employing private contractors (entities) to perform safety audits on carriers seeking new interstate operating authority (“new entrants”). A series of analyses and reports have indicated that new entrants are less likely to comply with safety regulations, and are more likely to be involved in crashes, than well established motor carriers. To help new entrants improve their level of compliance, FMCSA published an interim final rule on May 13, 2002 establishing a New Entrant Safety Assurance Process effective January 1, 2003, with the actual safety audits beginning mid-April 2003. This requirement applies to all motor carriers seeking authority after January 1, 2003 to operate in interstate or foreign commerce. The FMCSA has established an audit program, combining education and technical assistance, to provide new entrants with the opportunity to better understand their safety obligations and demonstrate their ability to comply with our regulations before they travel on the nation’s highways. The safety audit will be used as the basis for granting permanent operating authority. More details regarding the New Entrant Safety Assurance Process may be found in the May 13, 2002 interim final rule (Federal Register Doc. 02-11730). The safety audits associated with this RFI will be conducted on U.S. and Canadian motor carriers during the carriers’ first 18 months of operation to assess the safety posture of the carrier and its knowledge of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) and applicable Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMRs). The safety audit will consist of a review of the new entrant’s safety data, a review of motor carrier documents, and an interview session with a designated carrier representative. Areas covered include, but are not limited to, qualification of drivers, hours of service, vehicle inspection, repair and maintenance, transporting and marking hazardous materials, controlled substance testing standards, medical standards, and commercial driver’s license standards. Auditors will not have enforcement responsibilities, but will be required to perform inspections. The FMCSA estimates there are approximately 40,000 new entrant carriers seeking operating authority annually. The FMCSA also estimates that a safety audit will take approximately 4-6 hours. The audits will occur at the carrier’s place of business or in a group session held in central locations in each state. Only certified FMCSA personnel will conduct audits on Canadian carriers. The FMCSA estimates that contract personnel will conduct approximately 10,000 safety audits each year in the United States. The FMCSA and State personnel will conduct the remaining audits. The FMCSA safety audit software will be used to conduct the audit. All audit results will be submitted to the FMCSA where a determination will be made if the carrier passed/failed the audit. To be eligible, contractors must be completely independent of motor carrier entities. Only certified safety auditors, trained in an FMCSA approved auditor certification-training program, may conduct the safety audits. Safety auditors also must satisfactorily complete annual recertification requirements. The certification and recertification process can be found at http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/mexican/criteria.htm. Cost of the training will be borne by the contractor. The FMCSA may award multiple contracts with consideration given to geography, carrier population, and participation of States conducting audits. Under this RFI, FMCSA solicits statements from private entities capable of managing a large volume of work on a regional basis. Working within defined parameters, the FMCSA seeks the following information regarding how best to set up the contract and how the private entity would handle this effort. Describe specifically (1) Experience the company has in the area of transportation safety audits or similar governmental/non-governmental activities; (2) Based on experience, determine the type of contract and structure (include travel if required) best suited for the requirement; (3) Identify issues that should or could be anticipated by a contractor in attracting staff that meets the certification requirements or ability to find staff that already meets the certification requirements; (4) Identify potential lead time required after a contract is signed before beginning work; (5) Describe how the work assignments would be structured; (6) Describe how the entire program would be managed; (7) Discuss capability of providing key personnel; (8) Describe the mechanisms used for quality control; and (9) Describe the flexibility to move resources geographically based on program needs. Interested companies should submit a comprehensive package by Tuesday, June 10, 2003, 2:00 PM EDT. Include the company name and address as well as the name of the responsible person to whom future communications should be addressed and their telephone number, facsimile telephone number, and E-mail address. Any information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. All information received will be kept in the strictest confidence and only used internally by the contracting officer. It will not be released or shared with any other government agency or any government contractors. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3.    Information will be used to assist in planning and development of acquisition strategy by FMCSA for eventual procurement of these services. Information submitted under this RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis announcements are issued to assist the Agency in performing market research, to determine industry interest and capability.  This is not a request for proposals. 

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking interested sources capable of providing Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) to support the mission of the Agency.  DTRA's mission is to safeguard America's interests from weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high explosives) by controlling and reducing the threat and providing quality tools and services for the warfighter.  The objective of the future solicitation is to acquire technical and operational advisory and assistance services for DTRA and its operational elements, in support of research, planning, designing, developing, implementing, integrating, testing, applying, and evaluating emerging and mature technologies.  In addition, the contractor must provide operational assistance and support to DTRA's mission needs.  Potential sources must have demonstrated expertise in all the following areas:

&#61623; Research Development Technology and Evaluation Program Management and Project integration support;
&#61623; Program planning, coordination  and general support;
&#61623; Strategic planning, programs, cost benefit analysis and process improvement
&#61623; Capability to apply structural business methods to large, complex high-risk programs
&#61623; Accelerating delivery of Special Operational Forces Counterproliferation technologies; 
&#61623; Developing special weapons and planning tools to support Combatant Commands’ needs for rapid, responsive systems to reduce Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) threats;
&#61623; Providing attack planning and assessing post-attack effects of weapons on tunnel infrastructures;
&#61623; Providing real-time operational support using DTRA’s suite of consequence assessment tools for protection and security;
&#61623; Nuclear Stockpile Support in the area of technology development
&#61623; Nuclear Stockpile Support operations
&#61623; Homeland Defense Technology and Operational Support
&#61623; Support military and civil defense (combating terrorism and homeland defense) against and response to WMD use;
&#61623; Operations Center Support--Assessment and Analysis Reachback Support;  
&#61623; Threat Reduction Advisory Committee (TRAC) support;
&#61623; Arms control technology support;
&#61623; Information technology strategic and architecture planning;
&#61623; Blast mitigation technology support;
&#61623; Chemical Biological Defense support (non-medical/medical/technology transition)

&#61623; Ability to research and access previously unidentified deficiencies in expertise for forward looking studies.


DTRA requests that potentially interested sources respond to any or all of the following:

1) In the past, the Agency had one contractor provide integrated A&AS support for the majority of the Directorates.  The Agency is considering obtaining A&AS services under a single contractual instrument.  In your opinion, is such an approach feasible and is it effective?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach?  If you do not consider a single contract/contractor to be viable, please provide your recommendations as to how the requirements should be grouped.  

2) What type of contract is most appropriate for a requirement of this nature?  Is an IDIQ type of arrangement appropriate?  What are the advantages of disadvantages of such a contract?

3) If an IDIQ arrangement is utilized, will a single or multiple awards be most effective?  Please provide rationale.

4) In acquiring A&AS services, the avoidance and mitigation of conflicts of interest is of significant concern.  Please suggest strategies we may use to effectively protect against conflicts of interest, while promoting competition and optimum performance.   If we use a strategy which precludes the A&AS prime contractor from pursing any other business with the Agency, would it impact your decision to submit an offer?


Please send responses to any or all of these questions, and any other feedback, to Mr. Edward B. Hale, Jr., Contracting Officer, via facsimile at (703) 325-9294 or e-mail (edward.hale@dtra.mil) by close of business on 1 June 2003.  Please limit your response to five pages.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is in the process of developing a federal government-wide software enterprise licensing program called SmartBUY. The purpose of this program is to consolidate the purchasing power of the federal government and focus these volume requirements to obtain optimal pricing and preferred terms and conditions for widely used commercial software.  This effort will seek to use market forces and existing vendor business models, combined with the GSA Schedules program, to establish enterprise software agreements that will be mandatory for federal government software purchasing where SmartBUY agreements exist.  The effort will seek to establish agreements for widely used and/or high dollar volume software titles.  Participating vendors must have a GSA Schedule contract or use a reseller with a GSA Schedule contract.  

The General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service is requesting comments on this plan for federal government-wide software enterprise licensing.  Future communications will request vendor proposals, so this request is for comments on the concept of federal government enterprise software agreements.  If you have any questions regarding SmartBUY, you may contact Mike Butterfield at (703) 305-5225.  Please provide comments no later than May 30, 2003.

<DESC>The Library of Congress has a requirement for contract services to provide a Cost Benefit Analysis to identify alternative solutions for the HRMS functionality in the areas of recruitment, classification and performance management to augment the PeopleSoft delivered capabilities. The successful offeror  will review existing documentation and conduct interviews to gain a understanding of the current business processes related to the HRMS functionality in the areas of recruitment, classification and performance management.  A focus must be made especially on those requirements that differ from those provided in the PeopleSoft HRMS Release 8.x and those that differ from standards adhered to by other federal government agencies.  The successful offeror will review our current implementation of PeopleSoft HRMS release 7.0 to further identify requirements and compare with the enhanced functionality of PeopleSoft HRMS Release 8.x.  The information gathered will serve as a baseline from which we can identify and evaluate alternative solutions, including but not necessarily limited to, third party bolt-on software applications and customizations of the as-is delivered functionality of PeopleSoft HRMS 8.x.  We want three alternatives identified to consider, one of which should be the current application being used for recruitment, classification and performance management. The identified alternatives will be matched against the requirements to assess how each alternative meets the requirement and where remaining gaps may exist.  A cost estimate for each alternative is required and must be quantified.  The resulting document will provide us with information with which to make an informed decision regarding the most beneficial alternative.  It also will provide cost information in sufficient detail to support the request for funding to carry out the selected alternatives(s).  Please provide resumes. All parties must submit proposals by email adoz@loc.gov or fax at 202-707-8611 not later than May 28, 3003 by 12:00 pm.



		
			STATEMENT OF WORK
                    Human Resources Cost Benefit Analysis



BACKGROUND

Currently HRS has implemented PeopleSoft HRMS Release 7.0 to support our needs for automation of personnel action requests.  We have identified a need to upgrade this version of PeopleSoft HRMS 7.0 to a Release 8.x or higher and we are interested in investigating options for replacing certain functionality contained in the as-delivered HRMS product with other third-party applications integrated with the HRMS application.   HRS will also consider modifications to the delivered HRMS as another alternative.  The purpose of these enhancements, whether by customization or third-party applications, is to better meet the requirements of the Library in carrying out our HR mission and to facilitate the Library's overall goal to move to the digital era and make greater use of web enabled technologies.  

SCOPE OF WORK

The Library of Congress requires contract services to identify alternative solutions for the HRMS functionality in the areas of recruitment, classification and performance management to augment the PeopleSoft delivered capabilities.  The results will be documented in a Cost-Benefit and Alternatives Analysis report. 

DELIVERABLE

The successful offeror shall deliver to the Library a Cost-Benefit and Alternatives Analysis documentation template and format on/before July 7, 2003:


AWARD
	
Award will be based on technical acceptability and price.
