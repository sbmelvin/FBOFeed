<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) anticipates a cost plus award fee contract in support of CMS’ Chronic Care Improvement-Information Management System (CCI-IMS).  This existing system supports the activities of the Chronic Care Improvement Programs.  This program provides for a disease management pilot program.  The CCI-IMS supports all facets of the program, including storing claims, eligibility/enrollment, participation, audit, payment, performance, and other data.  Additionally, it provides for a robust reporting system.  The CCI-IMS is a relational database system, compliant with CMS architecture, which resides on the Medicare Data Communications Network. 

If CMS decides to issue a request for proposal, it will be an 8(a) set-aside. Please note that an approved accounting system is necessary for bidding on a cost type contract.

In an attempt to improve the understanding of the CCI-IMS requirements, to allow potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and to increase efficiency in proposal preparation, CMS is releasing the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) for this effort with this announcement.  Attached is a copy of the Draft SOW CMS anticipates incorporating into the Request for Proposal (RFP).  

CMS anticipates a November 28, 2005 solicitation release for a Cost Plus Award Fee contract with an approximate two week transition period, a base year and four (4), one-year (1) option periods.  Again, this is an 8(a) SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE for which only 8(a) Small Business Concerns will be eligible to participate.  
Any questions should be directed to Ms. Gina Romano, Contract Specialist, 410-786-8645, or via e-mail at Gina.Romano@cms.hhs.gov.  E-mail communications should include company name, type of small business, address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers.  Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps.

THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  
THIS IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. 
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  
NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.   
RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION.

<SOLNBR>701816R009
<RESPDATE>011706
<ARCHDATE>11102006
<CONTACT>Gary Goldberg Contracting Officer 9077863408     gary_goldberg@fws.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Subsistence Management, administers the Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program (Catalog of Federal and Domestic Assistance Number 15.636 Alaska Subsistence Management).  The Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program (FRMP) is seeking technically sound projects that gather information to manage and conserve subsistence fishery resources in Alaska.  The program also develops fisheries management expertise within Alaska Native and rural organizations and promotes collaboration among Federal, State, Alaska Native and local organizations.  The Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program encompasses awards made through both Federal assistance and procurement instruments (contracts).  This Request for Proposals is the single designated annual competition through which multiple awards will be made.  A twin posting of this announcement of Request for Proposals # 701816R009 is posted on http://www.grants.gov.   As in past years, studies that gather, analyze, and report information needs for effective subsistence fisheries management on Federal public lands in Alaska (National Wildlife Refuges, National Forests, National Parks and Preserves, National Conservation Areas, National Wild and Scenic River Systems, National Petroleum Reserves, and National Recreation Areas) will be considered. The Federal Subsistence Board (Board) has established guidelines for proposals to successfully compete for funding.  Activities that are outside the scope of the Monitoring Program and will not be considered include: habitat protection, mitigation, restoration, and enhancement; hatchery propagation, restoration, enhancement and supplementation; and contaminant assessment, evaluation, and monitoring.  These important activities are most appropriately addressed by the responsible land management or regulatory agency, not the Monitoring Program.  In addition, projects where the primary objective is capacity building (e.g., science camps, technician training, intern programs), are not eligible for funding under the Monitoring Program.  However, monitoring projects with capacity building as a secondary objective are encouraged, and partnerships/capacity building is one of four ranking criteria used to evaluate proposals.  The Office of Subsistence Management invites the submission of proposals for fisheries investigation studies to be initiated under the 2007 Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program.  The Monitoring Program provides $6.25 million annually in funding to support research and monitoring of Federal subsistence fisheries in Alaska.  The funding commitments to multiple year projects influence the amount of funding available each year for new projects.  In 2007, approximately $4.3 million will be available to fund new monitoring and research projects needed to sustain Federal subsistence fisheries for rural Alaskans on Federal lands; remaining funding is obligated to existing projects. Although all proposals addressing Federal subsistence fisheries will be considered, the Office of Subsistence Management is targeting the 2007 Request for Proposals towards priority information needs identified either by strategic planning efforts or by expert opinion from Regional Advisory Councils, the Technical Review Committee, and the Fisheries Information Services Division staff.  A list of priority information needs is included in the application package.  Two categories of information will be considered: 1) harvest monitoring and traditional ecological knowledge (HM-TEK), and 2) stock status and trends (SST).  Harvest monitoring studies can provide information on numbers and species of fish harvested, locations of harvests, and gear types used.  Methods used to gather information on subsistence harvest patterns include harvest calendars, mail-in questionnaires, household interviews, subsistence permit reports and telephone interviews.  Traditional ecological knowledge studies collect and analyze information from knowledgeable people on a variety of topics, including: fish ecology, species identification, local names, life history, taxonomy, seasonal movements, harvests, spawning and rearing areas, population trends, environmental observations, and traditional management systems.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA), herein after referred to as the Government, is an independent executive branch federal agency created by the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-33; 111 Stat.712). The Agency’s mission is to increase public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community. SCOPE:  The Contractor shall provide on-site services, monitor and effectively coordinate the Domestic Violence referral process for CSOSA, facilitate alternative forms of Domestic Violence services (i.e., assessments, staffing, liaison work with public providers) for CSOSA; and monitor and coordinate the Domestic Violence referral process. The Contractor’s services are intended to facilitate the timely assessment and/or evaluation of CSOSA clients, either court ordered into the Domestic Violence Supervision Unit for an evaluation or supervision, have a history of Domestic Violence offenses, or demonstrate behavior that suggests Domestic Violence services are warranted.

Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility.  TYPE OF CONTRACT:  The Government intends to issue a firm, fixed price award for a base period and four one-year option periods.  REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL:  The RFP shall be issued on or about the November 30, 2005. Source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15 shall be utilized for the award of the planned contract, using a trade-off between technical and price. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s), however, firms are required to price all option years to be considered for award. Past performance will also be considered in making the award determination.  The RFP will be available ONLY on the Internet at the FedBizzOpps website: http://www.fbo.gov  The proposal closing date/time will be stated in the RFP, along with specific proposal submittal requirements and evaluation factors for award.

The format requirements  for the full proposal are set forth in the Program Announcement on the DOD SERDP web site. Each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal. The pre-propos al review step allows interested organizations to get initial Government feedback on their technologies without the expense of a full proposal. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that  work. Multiple awards may be made to address a particular SON. It is expected that awards totaling approximately $2.0 million will result.

The booth and meeting room spaces to support the annual I/ITSEC event in the OCCC are only available through NDIA because the convention center is under contract with NDIA for this purpose through 2009, with a tentative agreement through 2015.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Colmek Systems Engineering, 2001 South 3480, Salt Lake City, Utah for the acquisition of ten (10) video recorders to capture neutralizer nose camera video for post mission analysis review by tactics personnel for the AN/ASQ 232 Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS).  AMNS will be integrated into both MH-53E and MH-60S helicopters.  Colmek Systems Engineering designed and built the PMA station.  Colmek is the only manufacturer of this video recorder.  This video recorder is the only recorder that fits within the console accessory electronics compartment and accepts PAL video format.  Most importantly this is the only device that can record on a media that can be viewed by HM-14 and HM-15 squadron personnel when forward deployed using existing AMCM equipment.  In order for the video information to be recorded and displayed on Fleet equipment the Colmek video recor!  der must be utilized.  Therefore, it is imperative that the Video Recorders are acquired from Colmek Systems Engineering.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The Natural Resources Conservation Service, Oklahoma State Office, announces a request for SF 330 (Architect and Engineering Qualifications) for Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) A&E services for rehabilitation planning services of watershed flood control projects in the State of Oklahoma. The contract will include one base year and three option years.

Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. The price of any single task order shall be at least $5,000, but shall not exceed $1,000,000. The maximum task order amount for each contract period (base year and each option year) shall be $1,000,000. Task orders could include the performance of any part of the rehabilitation planning process and Supplemental Watershed Plan/Environmental Evaluation (EE) preparation. The estimated price range for a task order covering all services required for the completion of a rehabilitation planning project is $225,000 to $1,000,000. This procurement is unrestricted and is open to all businesses regardless of size. The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541330. 

The required work under this contract may include all or any part of planning and plan development, which may include surveys and geological investigations:

PLANNING and DEVELOPMENT of supplemental watershed agreements and plan EE for the rehabilitation of aging flood control dams will be performed according to Oklahoma NRCS planning policy. All work will be conducted by an interdisciplinary planning team of technical specialists, which will include at a minimum, a planning team leader, planning engineer, hydrologist, economist, biologist, geologist, and archaeologist.

SURVEYS will include, but may not be limited to, reservoir sediment surveys, topographic storage surveys (detailed survey of existing dam embankment and auxiliary spillway), and downstream profiles with cross sections for breach inundation mapping.  The contractor will employ a registered professional land surveyor in the State of Oklahoma to supervise all surveying work.

GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS, although not typically conducted during rehabilitation planning, may be required and would include laboratory soils analysis, testing, and reporting. All work by a drilling subcontractor will be field supervised by a professional engineering geologist.

All work shall be performed in accordance with NRCS standards, specifications, policy, handbooks, procedures, Oklahoma supplements to the referenced documents, and the rules and regulations of the State of Oklahoma.  

TIMEFRAME FOR PROJECT COMPLETION. Rehabilitation planning in Oklahoma is conducted under the umbrella of a statewide Environmental Impact Statement for rehabilitation of aging watershed dams. The Oklahoma NRCS has developed a streamlined planning process and plan format specifically for rehabilitation.  As a result, planning time has been drastically reduced.  The contractor will be expected to produce a draft supplemental watershed agreement and plan EE in 120 days.  The draft document will then undergo technical peer review by the NRCS Water Resources Staff, the State Office (SO) Engineering Design Staff, and the NRCS National Water Management Center in Little Rock, Arkansas.  All technical reviews take 3 to 5 months.  A rehabilitation planning project should be completed in 7 to 9 months.

PROJECT OVERSIGHT. NRCS will provide technical oversight on all phases of the rehabilitation planning project from surveys, to geological investigations, to planning and final supplemental plan preparation.

CONTRACT PERIOD. The Government contemplates making a single award to a firm using a firm and fixed price delivery/task order type contract. The period of performance for the base year will run from contract award through September 30, 2006. The government may, at its option, extend the contract up to three additional years by exercising each of the three single year renewal options. Task orders will be negotiated as firm and fixed price procurements.

PAYMENT FOR WORK. Payment will be made for services upon acceptable completion of each phase of work as outlined below.  Acceptable completion is defined as work that has progressed to a point that after review by NRCS, is determined sufficient to support advancement to the next phase of the project.

PLANNING:  Payment will be made in increments of not less than ten percent (10%) of total task order completed.  Final payment will be made upon the successful completion of a final supplemental watershed plan EE and receipt of all supporting data in proper file format.

SURVEYS: Payment will be made for 100 percent (100%) of the task order fee for surveys after acceptable completion of all surveys and data processing.

GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS (if required):  1) 100 percent (100%) of the task order fee covering field investigations and data processing after acceptable completion of all work,  and 2) 100 percent (100%) of the task order fee covering laboratory soils analysis, testing, and reporting after acceptable soils mechanics report has been received.

OWNERSHIP OF DOCUMENTS. The NRCS acknowledges that the supporting data, documents, and preliminary designs generated by the Contractor are instruments of professional service.  However, all documents, including survey data, geological investigation data and lab reports, resource inventory data, engineering, hydraulic, hydrologic, and economic model outputs, drawings, maps, estimates, and all other data used in the preparation of the supplemental watershed plan EE are the property of the NRCS.  Supporting data will be organized and filed by discipline.  Electronic data will be provided to NRCS on a CD and indexed with a brief description of each file.

Firms will be selected using the following preselection and selection criteria:

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to extend the term of the Department of Treasury Communications System (TCS) contract No. TIRNO-95-D-00099 to Northrop Grumman Information Technology, Inc. for 6 months and one twelve month option period pending the competitive award of the follow-on contract.  The TCS contract, after exercising FAR 52.217-8, will expire March 27, 2006.  The Department of Treasury does not anticipate award and complete transition of all sites before this contract expires.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Department of Treasury has a continuing need for Wide Area Network (WAN) communications capabilities.  The extension of the TCS contract allows for uninterrupted Wide Area Network (WAN) communications capabilities for the Department of Treasury.  This extension enables Treasury to mitigate risks to the nation’s financial infrastructure and allow for successful transition to the follow-on contract.  This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids.  The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<SUBJECT>R -- Audit Support for Universal Service Administrative Company for Support Mechanisms
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-USAC-1
<ARCHDATE>12312005
<CONTACT>Wilma Mooney, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-418-1865, Fax 202-418-5963, Email wilma.mooney@fcc.gov
<DESC>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed that all providers of interstate telecommunications services contribute to a federal universal service support mechanism in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner and that there be specific, predictable, and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has by federal regulation designated the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) to administer the universal service support mechanisms for schools, libraries, rural health care providers, high cost areas, and low income consumers.  USAC manages the Universal Service Fund (USF) in its administration of these support mechanisms.
In its role as Administrator, USAC has the responsibility to take measures to prevent, deter and detect waste, fraud, and abuse involving the USF and the universal support mechanisms, and to report to the FCC and Congress regarding actions to prevent waste, fraud and abuse.  In fulfilling its responsibilities, USAC works closely with the FCC Office of Inspector General (OIG).  The oversight responsibility of the FCC OIG is to independently detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse with respect to all FCC programs, including the USF.  USAC, in consultation with the OIG, developed the requirements of this Request for Proposals (RFP).  The purpose of this procurement is to conduct beneficiary audits that will enable USAC, in consultation with FCC OIG, to:  (1) detect waste, fraud, and abuse by beneficiaries of the universal service support mechanisms, (2) deter waste, fraud, and abuse by beneficiaries of the universal service support mechanisms, (3) generate insights about the compliance of beneficiaries with applicable law and the quality of administration of the universal service support mechanisms, and (4) identify areas for improvement in the compliance of beneficiaries with applicable law and the administration of the universal service mechanisms.  The preliminary estimated number of audits to be performed nationwide in the first year, under this procurement is approximately 700.  The estimated number of audits is sufficient to calculate an estimated error rate of improper payments in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance regarding the Improper Payment Information Act (IPIA).  Audits shall be conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Audit Standards (GAAS), Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), and Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), Public Law 107-300.  The RFP also requires offerors to have the capability to provide investigative support services.  
This contracting action replaces a prior USAC competitive procurement for these audit services that commenced in November 2004.  All previous offerors are encouraged to submit proposals.  In addition, new offerors are also invited to submit proposals.  

It is anticipated that this solicitation will result in multiple awards to allow for competition between the awardees for specific task orders.  Awarded contracts will have a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  It is anticipated that fixed price task orders will be awarded for audit services and labor hour task orders will be awarded for investigative services.  Due to the number of potential relationships between offerors and contributors, service providers, and/or beneficiaries of the USF, offerors will be required to disclose any actual or potential personal or organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs), as well as their process for identifying and evaluating potential or actual OCIs.  A mitigation plan shall be required if an actual or potential conflict of interest is identified by disclosure or other means.  It should be noted that if an offeror’s proposed mitigation plan is deemed to be inadequate to avoid, neutralize, or adequately mitigate an identified actual or potential OCI, then the offeror’s proposal will be subject to disqualification without further evaluation. 
The deadline for submission of proposals will be stated in the RFP.  Late and non-responsive proposals shall not be evaluated or considered for award.
Copies of the RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.universalservice.org no earlier than 15 days after publication of this synopsis, or can be requested by FAX at 202-776-0080, or by phone at 202-776-0200.

<DESC>The Department of State's National Foreign Affairs Training Center, Foreign Service Institute (FSI) provides training and professional development to personnel of the Department of State and the Foreign Service community.  The Transition Center (TC) division of FSI offers security awareness training to foreign affairs agency personnel and their eligible family members in the form of the Security Overseas Seminar (SOS) program. The SOS program currently requires the services of a qualified and experienced contractor(s) to conduct twenty-six, fifty-minute presentations on crisis management in an overseas environment at each of the seminars.

The overall aim of the SOS training is to motivate individuals to identify the likely security risks overseas and to develop a plan for dealing with them.  The presentations addressing personal security will be provided in direct support of the SOS program. Over two thousand participants per year attend these trainings.  Classes range from 30 to 200 participants with average class sizes being around 100.  Participants come from many U. S. Government agencies.  Their level of experience in the Foreign Service varies from newcomers in the overseas environment to veterans with twenty years or more of service and their family members.  This variance has proved to be both a benefit and a challenge.  Newcomers appreciate the firsthand experiences related by veterans.  However, it has been important that presenters be mindful to avoid elementary approaches that could bore those with more experience.  It has always been important to acknowledge individual experiences the audience members bring to the seminar and to provide some measure of audience participation. The two-day SOS program is offered twenty-six (26) times a year, and presents a variety of presentation formats in order to maximize the efficiency of the program.    

The fifty minute presentation entitled, “Managing in a Crisis,” is an introduction to how to cope with disasters ranging from natural ones such as floods to terrorist ones like the recent bombing in London. The presentation itself has been developed by TC/T.  The awardee(s) will be responsible for the refinement, update, and delivery of the existing model.  The presentation will include, but will not be limited to the following topics: 

·Experiences of individuals who have served overseas; 
·The relationship of crisis management to the other security and safety presentations of the program; 
·Listing and explaining the stages of crises; 
·Community preparation and crisis management initiatives (both at post and within the Department);

The selected contractor(s) must perform the services listed in this section under the general guidelines established by the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  During the agreement periods the contractor(s) shall be responsible for the following:

·Preparation and use of top-quality visual aids compatible with the Foreign Service Institute’s audio-visual technology.  Handouts may be provided by awardee if desired, subject to the approval of the course coordinator.
·Subject matter input toward course materials for the personal security portion of Security Overseas Seminar Guidebook.
·Awardee(s) will be required to attend an orientation meeting with the Contracting Office Representative (COR) and other staff members.
·Awardee(s) will be required to submit an electronic copy of the PowerPoint file (if used) and presentation notes to course coordinator for the files.
·The awardee(s) must arrive 10 minutes prior to the start of each class and respond to follow-up questions at the end of the sessions.  

The solicitation document for this requirement shall be made available for review (via FEDBIZOPPS.GOV) by September 19, 2005.

Please submit all questions and inquiries to Bernard Salter Jr. in writing at salterb@state.gov by September 22, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

See the file titled "RFP Questions and Answers". ________________________________________________________________ 8 Nov 05:  The status of this solicitation has been changed to "released  RFP". Documents are no longer in draft status.  Changes made to the draft  postings are identified in the file titled "Changes to solicitation  documents". The response date for this RFP remains 15 Nov 05, 4:00 PM EST. __________________________________________________________ Support Services for Comprehensive Cost and Requirements (CCaR) System  Draft RFP See attached solicitation. Note that proposals must be submitted  no later than 15 Nov 05, 4:00PM EST. Clarification:  The RFP has been posted at PIXS with a status of  "pre-solicitation" and a "draft" watermark on the documents.  The  "pre-solicitation" status is an attempt to fix a communication problem  between PIXS and FBO, and the documents are marked as drafts only because  legal review has not been completed.  We do NOT anticipate any changes to  any of the documents.  Once the review process is complete, we will  convert the status of the posting to "released RFP" and remove the "draft"  watermark from the postings.  However, we went ahead and posted the RFP in  draft status to give offerors as much time as possible before the 15 Nov  05 response date to prepare their proposals. For more information on "CCaR Support Services", please refer to:  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=3964

On Wednesday, December 7, 2005, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct an Industry Day for prospective Small Business Subcontractors  for the construction phase of the new Federal Building & U. S. Courthouse in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The Industry Day, or Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session, will be conducted from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the Tuscaloosa Department of Transportation Building, 1000 28th Avenue, Tuscaloosa., Alabama, 35401.

The new Federal Building & U. S. Courthouse is to be constructed in downtown Tuscaloosa will consist of approximately 9,803 gross square meters (gsm) or 105,520 gross square feet (gsf) without parking and approximately 11,517 gsm or 123,970 gsf including 41 interior parking spaces. Upon completion the new Federal Building-Courthouse will provide space for multiple agencies including the United States District Court, United States Bankruptcy Court, United States Marshals Service, United States Probation Service, Social Security Administration and the Social Security Administration's office of Hearing and Appeals, Congressional Offices, and offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States General Services Administration. The Estimated Construction Cost (ECC) is approximately $30 to $40 million for the combined services (pre-construction and optional construction phase services).

This Industry Day is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in The Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the construction firm that is selected for this project.  The construction firm that is selected for this project will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan prior to contract award demonstrating a commitment to awarding 39% of the dollars mutually agreed upon by the prospective awardee and the government within the following categories: Small Disadvantaged Businesses (including 8(a)) - 6%; Woman-Owned Small Businesses – 5%; Hubzone Businesses – 3%; Small Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses – 3%.  

Prospective Small Business Subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with the selected prime construction contractor and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  It is anticipated that this Industry Day will assist the Prime Contractor in identifying qualified subcontractors to meet the subcontracting goals established for this project.  However, GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between potential Primes and Subcontractors; therefore any contracts that may be entered into as a result of this Industry Day will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Industry Day should be directed to either David Gibson, GSA's Small Business Outreach Specialist, telephone 404-331-2366, e-mail at davida.gibson@gsa.gov; or Dinora Gonzalez GSA's Small Business Technical Advisor, telephone 404-331-3031, email at  dinora.gonzalez@gsa.gov.  Questions pertaining the the project should be directed to Laurie Chestnut, Contracting Officer at 404-331-4368 or by email at laurie.chestnut@gsa.gov.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Contracts Office for the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center intends to competitively acquire technical and engineering services for the Operations and Maintenance of the M/V INDEPENDENCE in support of the ocean RDT&E and ocean construction programs.

This contract is not simply an effort to "operate a vessel from port A to Port B". The work involves engineering analysis, complex vessel handling, maneuvering, and load handling. Knowledge of, and experience in, vessel support toward accomplishing at-sea ocean tasks is mandatory. The contractor shall provide a team of technical and crew services necessary to operate the M/V INDEPENDENCE, with crew and appropriate supervision to perform support services including, operation, maintenance, management and modifications to the M/V INDEPENDENCE and support hardware necessary to support the at-sea tasks. The Navy anticipates a CPFF IDIQ Delivery Order contract to be issued. The anticipated contract will be one year with four one year options. The anticipated level of effort is roughly 42,000 man-hours per year. Offerors must be wholly-owned U.S. firms with no Foreign Ownership, Control, or Interest (FOCI) as defined in Section 3 of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, DOD 5220.22M.  When proposal is submitted, the contractor shall possess a Top Secret facility clearance.  Also, at time of proposal submission, 8 of the 11 crew members and contractor’s Security Officer shall have a satisfactory Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) completed within the last five years under the provisions of DCID 6/4.

The Solicitation will be limited to those potential offerors who have the required security clearances. Primary Technical requirements are as follows:  (1) Technical:  The technical proposals will be reviewed and each subfactor will be evaluated: Subfactor (a) Employee qualifications and experience, Subfactor (b)  Company relevant experience demonstrated by past performance, Subfactor (c) Company organization management plan and facilities.  (2) Past Performance, (3) Cost.  Unrealistic Cost, either too high or too low, may result in a reduced technical rating.
The award of the contract will be limited to those potential offeror who has the required security clearances.  Only written requests for the solicitation will be honored.

Title: Multi-Platform SIGINT Fusion and ISR Management

Technical POC/Program Manager, Carolyn Sheaff, AFRL/IFEA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505, Phone (315) 330-7147, e-mail: carolyn.sheaff@rl.af.mil.

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and development for innovative concepts and techniques for Cross-Platform SIGINT Fusion and Correlation. 

The Air Force Research Laboratory Fusion Technology Branch has developed an open, distributed, object-oriented architecture called the Extensible Data Architecture (XDA) for information fusion under the Adaptive Sensor Fusion (ASF) program. This program included support for multiple interoperable fusion components and a public Application Programmer's Interface (API) that is suitable for inserting new fusion components into the system. Fusion component interoperability is based on a shared description of the battlespace and shared data exchange and persistence mechanisms. Through the implementation of a common interface and a common battlespace ontology, new and legacy fusion engines and capabilities can be encapsulated and become interoperable components within a common architecture. Given this stable environment for test and development, the performance of legacy and new fusion engines can be rapidly inserted, evaluated and consistently quantified.

The NSA sponsored Advanced Fusion Workstation (AFWS) developed by AFRL is a government owned and extensible information fusion system built upon the XDA/ASF core services.  In it’s present instantiation it is focused on solving the SIGINT fusion problem set.  The extensible nature of the system however, allows it to easily accommodate multiple sensing modalities, and data sources.  One of the major goals of the AFWS is to accommodate inferential reasoning to achieve JDL level II and III fusion.  In the present configuration the system utilizes the K-PASA template based reasoning services of WebTAS.  Ongoing work is incorporating automated reasoners using a Bayesian approach and Demptser Shaefer reasoning capabilities.  The basic premise is to transition from semi, to fully automated inferential reasoning, as the underlying science of the fusion components support such transitions.

The scope of this announcement is to acquire necessary technologies and their integration into the IFEA Advanced Fusion Workstation XDA-based architecture.  

Specific goals and capabilities include but are not limited to: 
1.  AOI Monitor – Provides an operator defined area of interest, within which he/she can define a set of rules to be applied to multi-INT streaming data.  When the real time state occurs the operator is notified. (JDL Level II)

2.  Inferential Reasoning Component – Component to provide semi-automated JDL level II fusion.  This component will instantiate multiple reasoning methods that include: A) Operators codified knowledge of patterns of activity based upon a-priori knowledge.  As various states of the activity models are satisfied, operators are notified that predetermined activities are likely occurring.  B)  Automated inferential reasoning system that may provide SCI level identification of elements in the battlespace, as well as their interaction with one another.  This level of interaction may allow the system to infer intent of entities. C)  Bayesian based automated inferential reasoning approach to solve more complex entity interrelationships problems in the data (JDL Level II and perhaps III).

3.  MTI and ELINT Fusion – An MTI to ELINT fusion component should combine the precise geo-location characteristics provided by MTI with precise identity provided by ELINT. (JDL Level I)

4.  Emitter Mapping – This service will monitor comms external data and reconstruct C2 and other nodal associations between actors in the battlespace.  The ability to map specific clusters of particular types of comms nodes on the battlefield, will provide the capability to assess force strength, and disposition, as well as potentially identity. (JDL Level I)

5.  Automated Creation of Standard Knowledge Bases – Through extension of existing knowledge bases this component will provide a single and coherent source of a-priori knowledge against which other components can reason.  This service will integrate elements of the EIPB output in XML format.

6.  Standard I/O methods – Leveraging existing gateways to data sources such as TDDS and TDIMF as well as streaming MTI data.

7.  Background Acoustics – Existing background acoustics technology will be integrated into XDA.

8.  Speaker ID – Existing speaker ID technology will be integrated into XDA.

9.  Imagery and ELINT –  Information obtained from available satellite and airborne imagery can be combined with SIGINT information to increase identification accuracy and provide precise target location information needed for targeting. Fusion of SIGINT, IMINT, and other sources is required for hard-to-find targets

10.  Ontology Development – Definition and development of standard SIGINT ontology, extension of visualization ontology, and definition of multi-INT ontologies.

11.  CONOPS Development – A CONOPS document will be developed for Single Platform, Cross Platform, and AOC/DCGS Fusion Systems.

12.  ISR Management – Address the resource management, tasking and re-tasking of multiple, network centric sensors to perform SIGINT correlation and fusion to derive situation assessment in support of military operations.

The overall objective of this PRDA is to develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition system technologies.  This program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development. In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complementary activities including, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment. 

The developed system will be transitionable to Rivet Joint, Senior Scout, C2C, National Systems, the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and/or as applicable, the Air Force Transformation Center. 

The AFRL, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/IFE) is soliciting proposals to develop an open, government owned, Multi-INT fusion capability using ASF/AFWS Core Services Framework. Potential Offerors should have considerable experience and expertise in the following areas:  1)  Insertion of new and legacy fusion components and technologies into the ASF/XDA. 2)  Development of  interfaces, algorithms and databases, coordinate software development and integration of fusion modules; and integrate multiple-sources of sensor and intelligence reports. 3)  Recent operational experience on Rivet Joint, and in the AF DCGS and AF AOC. 4) SIGINT Domain Expertise. 5) ISR Management 6) SEI Level 2 Software Development 7) Risk Management 8) Program Management 9) Multi-INT Scenario Development and Modeling.

The program schedule should contain spiral developments and deliveries. 

The fusion system shall be designed to process, fuse and display the following types of information, as a minimum: Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications (COMINT), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI), and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT).  The design of the system shall not preclude the potential ingestion of other intelligence data, for example, Video, EO/IR, MSI/HSI, MASINT (seismic, acoustic, magnetic), HUMINT. 

Program reviews shall be conducted to track technical, financial and schedule performance and risk. 

Capability is sought that can be fully developed and transitioned to operational units as rapidly as possible. Since many applicable technologies exist today, offerors are encouraged to leverage technology from these other programs, as applicable. It is anticipated that offerors will investigate, apply, exploit and modify existing COTS and GOTS technologies. 

Deliverables will include technical reports, user's manuals, training manuals and delivery and integration of robust software prototypes into the AFRL ELINT Development Facility.  In addition, the level of maturity must be adequate to transition to the user community by integration and demonstrations into the DCGS and/or as applicable, the Air Force Transformation Center.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a two (2) to five (5) page white paper on their proposed research topic to: Air Force Research Laboratory/IFEA, ATTN: Ms. Carolyn Sheaff, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B:  Task Objective; and Section C:  Technical Summary.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. 

This PRDA is accepting white papers until 1 Oct 2008.  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award, FY 05 should be submitted by 1 May 04; FY 06 by 1 May 05; FY 07 by 1 May 06; and FY 08 by 1 May 07. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.

Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria:(l) Overall scientific and technical merit, including the rationale and approach for the proposed technology development, (2) Potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) Soundness of proposed technology transition approach, and (4)  Offerors demonstrated capability to successfully integrate various technologies.  .Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this PRDA.   All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal which shall be considered. Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. 

Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $200,000 to $1,000,000 per fiscal year.  Total funding for this PRDA is anticipated to be $24 M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this PRDA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:  FY04: $5M;  FY05: $5M;  FY06: $5M;  FY07: $5M;  FY08: $4M.

Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the TOP SECRET SCI level, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to those proposed efforts must be already cleared for access to TOP SECRET SCI information. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this PRDA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Allied foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.

Questions prior to the submission of a proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Carolyn Sheaff/315-330-7147, Carolyn.Sheaff@rl.af.mil.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition. 

A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

Contract  writting system problems prevented loading a complete RFP document. A word  version of the Draft RFP FA8626-05-R-2077 has been loaded to the PIXs  library below. This word version does not contain the section J  attachments which have been loaded separately to the library. Plans are to  update the draft RFP on 14 October 2005 to flesh out several aspects  including: H0XX – OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria; H081 –  Provide goals for Small Business participation; Section I Reference  Clauses – some fill-ins need filled in; Sec J – Exhibit A - add initial  CDRL Data Item Description (DID) package; Sec J – Attachment 1 – update  Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) Sections 1 -4 and Sec 6 to  eliminate redundancy and streamline the requirements; NOTE: PWS Section 5  describes the five functions, A through E,and is reasonably complete,  however Sections 1 – 4 and Section 6 need updating to streamline and add  the Service Delivery Summary (SDS)etc.; Sec L075 – Update paragraphs  7.3.2; 7.3.3; 7.3.4; for instructions on the Technical Expertise and  Systems Engineering Mission Capability sub-factors; add the tailored L-8  Labor Cost/Price spreadsheet; Sec M – Function E evaluation criteria need  added; remaining Sec M is good SIMAF Library Listing of planned contents  will be added to PIXS library Virtual Industry Day (VID) The Virtual  Industry Day (VID) Meet-Me phone number will be provided to interested  firms who register with the SIMAF POC Ms. Stiles at 937-904-7205,  Margaret.stiles@wpafb.af.mil Written questions provided in advance of the VID will have the most  complete answers provided.

Firms  will be identified during the VID only by a letter identifying their  company at time of registration, e.g. Company A, Company B, etc., actual  company names will not be used. Questions on the draft RFP for Virtual  Industry Day should be e-mailed to the buyer, Theresa hay, at  Theresa.hay@wpafb.af.mil with a copy to the Program manager, Vince Lewis  at Vincent.lewis@wpafb.af.mil . Detailed questions on format and minor  issues are not the purpose of the VID. Questions that address omissions  and significant issues or areas of confusion are desired. XR-SIMAF Library  The XR-SIMAF Library is not available until 19 Oct 05 between the hours of  0900 and 1500 EST. Library appointments must be made thru the SIMAF POC,  Ms. Stiles at 937-904-7205, Margaret.stiles@wpafb.af.mil **************************************************************************** Update 4 October 2005 - Virtual Industry Day for draft RFP (imminent  release) and Buyer Name Update The XR-SIMAF draft RFP is planned for  release by 11 October 2005. A Virtual Industry Day is planned to be held  1330 EST to 1530 EST, 18 October 2005. Interested firms should review the  draft RFP, once posted, and submit written questions via e-mail to the new  buyer, Theresa Hay, Theresa.Hay@wpafb.af.mil. Submittal in advance will  ensure that questions can be answered in a timely manner during the  Industry Day. Firms need to contact the Virtual Industry Day POC, Ms.  Patricia Stiles, (937) 904-7205, Margaret.Stiles@wpafb.af.mil, to register  for the event. Look for further information on this site for further  information regarding this Virtual Industry Day. Note: New buyer Theresa  Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future correspondence. ************************************************************************ Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of  Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the  Description in excess of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought  announcement of 17 May has been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the  XR-SIMAF PIXS library below as  "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05". NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions  received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July  2005.  ************************************************************* Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14  Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library. ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun  05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the  submittal of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday  June 17th will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions  were asked about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following  infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple  Functions QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past  performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR  requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would  it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate  attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments  that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common  or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC,  however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will  be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one  page cover page that may contain business information and details like  business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards  the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be  acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is  acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low  band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia  Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt  of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14  June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to industry via  PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings  will be loaded to PIXS and will available for download by COB 15 Jun 05.  ******************************************************************************Update: Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 Thefollowing sentences have been modified in the following synopsis toreflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

<DESC>Request for Information Project Number 38452 National Business Center - Information Technology (IT) Modernization Analysis For a Word version of this Request for Information, please refer to GovWorks web site at: http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp The following is a Request for Information (RFI) on a Modernization Analysis for the Department of Interior's National Business Center.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  Responses to this RFI must: "	Be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer at the below email address no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Time, November 28, 2005 to:  	anita.tolliver@mms.gov  SUBJECT LINE "38452--NBC IT Mod. Analysis" 	Anita Tolliver 	Phone: (703) 787-1092 	Fax: (703) 787-1106 "	Identify the name of the firm and contact information (name, telephone, email) for questions about the comments.   "	Be submitted in Microsoft Word and/or Adobe PDF format.   "	Be submitted in electronic form. Any questions on this RFI should be submitted to: anita.tolliver@mms.gov  SUBJECT LINE "NBC IT Modernization Analysis" Anita Tolliver Phone: (703) 787-1092 Fax: (703) 787-1106 Background The National Business Center (NBC) is the Department of the Interior (DOI) designated administrative support facility that provides common administrative services to DOI bureaus and other Federal agencies, as negotiated through cross servicing agreements.  Currently the NBC has offices in Washington, D, C.; Reston, VA; Denver, CO; Fort Huachuca, AZ; Sacramento, CA; Atlanta, GA, Albuquerque, NM, and Boise, ID.   The NBC's service offerings are provided on a fee for service basis, and include. "	Financial Management (FM) Services - as one of the Centers of Excellence (COEs) selected by OMB for the federal-wide FM Line of Business.  Provides customers with an array of Financial Management Systems Support and Accounting Operation Services; "	Human Resource (HR) Services - as one of the COEs selected by OMB for the federal-wide HR Line of Business.  Provides an extensive set of services for assisting in managing human capital, including: Core HR Services, Payroll, Expanded Services (Operational Servicing) and Random Drug and Alcohol Testing; "	Training Services - The DOI University offers several training programs, focusing on Leadership and Performance, Online Learning Systems, and Cultural Resources and Events; "	Acquisition Services - Provides lifecycle acquisition services including Contract Support, Charge Card Oversight Services, Leasing Services and Indirect Rate Negotiations; "	Appraisal Services - Provides appraisal services to DOI Bureaus.  The services offered include General Appraisal Services, Appraisal Review Services, Appraisal Consulting and Concession Valuations for customers; "	Aviation Services - Provides aviation policy and oversight for supporting all DOI aviation functions; "	Other DOI Support Services - A wide variety of services are provided including Creative Communication Services, Employee Services, Facilities Management, Property and Asset Management Services, Mandated Services, and DOI IT Support Services; and "	Information Technology (IT) Services - Premier provider of IT Services to the NBC, including Infrastructure, Integration, Disaster Recovery, Web Development, and IT Security in support of the NBC. To support these service offerings, the NBC procures, manages, operates, and, in many cases, has developed a portfolio of complex administrative and mission-oriented software applications.  These applications are supported by a heterogeneous IT environment that includes mainframe, client/server, and web architectures running on z/OS, UNIX, and Windows based platforms.   As is the case with many large enterprises, these applications and information systems have evolved independently over time and do not currently adhere to a consistent architecture.  This reduces the ability of the NBC to optimize the efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability of its IT environment, and thus its ability to competitively support its DOI and cross agency customers. For example, a significant portion of the work that is currently performed on one of the NBC's three IBM mainframes is moving to a server technology base in 2006.  This leaves the remaining services on the mainframe with a disproportionate cost allocation, and thus reduces the NBC's capability to competitively support its customers. Competition and choice are essential to the delivery of quality service, and the NBC recognizes that it must earn its customers by providing better service than other government COEs and private sector providers.  To meet this goal, it is imperative that the NBC resolve this immediate mainframe utilization issue while developing a forward looking strategy that will optimize performance across the enterprise, and provide an overall IT architecture that is cost efficient, flexible and scalable for future growth. Request for Information The purpose of this RFI is to afford industry an opportunity to comment on best practices and critical elements that the government should incorporate in structuring an Information Technology Modernization Analysis for the NBC.  The effectiveness, efficiency, and timeliness of the Technology Modernization Analysis, will be a key contributor to the success of the NBC IT Modernization and of the NBC's ability to competitively serve its customers.  Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed, but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.  Comments are solicited regarding the following. 1.	The NBC is considering a scope of work that includes developing an enterprise architecture for NBC (as-is, to-be, transition), identification and evaluation of alternatives for addressing the mainframe and overall IT environment, and a business case for the recommended alternative.  For the IT Modernization Analysis to provide a solid foundation for the modernization initiative, what are the key elements the government should ask for in terms of: a.	Scope b.	Critical success factors/performance measures (for the analysis) c.	Major tasks/steps d.	Schedule (time frames), including start up period between award and performance e.	Deliverables and their key characteristics f.	IT Modernization Analysis acquisition risks that must be managed/mitigated. 2.	The NBC is considering a negotiated firm-fixed price performance-based contract with an objective and performance measures.  Based on past experience and knowledge of Government competitive sourcing procedures: a.	Is this the best contract approach for an IT Modernization Analysis of this sort?  What are the plusses and minuses of alternative approaches? b.	What performance measures would be most effective in ensuring a successful IT Modernization Analysis?  c.	What is the size standard for the industry for this type of analysis, and whether the responding firm is below that size standard? d.	What are the best practices for commercial terms and conditions for this type of project? 3.	Selection will be made on a best-value basis.  What are the key factors the NBC should include in evaluating: a.	Approach and methodology b.	Past performance c.	Organizational experience d.	Personnel experience - what are the appropriate roles and the key qualifications for those roles? 4.	A statement of interest from all firms that respond to the RFI.  Comments, whether supportive or critical, are earnestly solicited regarding every aspect of the proposed initiative. Replies are not mandatory. Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Request for Proposals.  The use of comments received from industry to complete final statements of work and resulting solicitation documents will be at the discretion of the NBC. Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. The Government will not critique a potential offeror's comments and the RFI should not be used by offerors to market their products/services. The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the RFI. Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR THE ELECTROHYDRAULIC SERVOVALVE 
ON THE INTEGRATED SERVO ACTUATOR

Classification Code:	1650

DESCRIPTION

This announcement constitutes a Request for Information.  The Air Force plans to use flexible sustainment procedures to replace the existing electrohydraulic servovalve (EHV) with a more reliable, longer life EHV that carries a ten-year warranty.  Flexible sustainment encourages the procurement of items using performance-based acquisition specifications vice build-to-print requirements.  This procurement will be based on the "best value" to the government, not necessarily lowest procurement cost.  This EHV will incorporate state-of-the-art technology and be compatible with existing hardware and software interfaces in order to maintain form, fit, function, and interface (F3I) equivalence.  The information in this request is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting a market survey of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Ogden Air Logistics Center.  This is not a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid.

We are seeking contractors who are interested in designing and manufacturing a high reliability EHV using modern technology rather than following traditional build to print requirements.  The F-16 Logistics Operations Division has a requirement for a minimum of 255 units (0.30 replacement rate of 855 overhauled next-higher assemblies) units per fiscal quarter.  The new EHV will add redundancy in source of supply for the current EHV (National Stock Number 1650-01-084-1570WF, Part Number 975138-9).

Parties can respond in one of two fashions: 1) As an intended original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for an alternative part with limited data rights and working prototypes as a product of a RFQ, or 2) two as a reverse engineering shop whose request for quote (RFQ) response would include working prototypes and a set of build-to-print specifications to allow a full-and-open competition for production runs. If responding under option #2 please include a market analysis of what production run costs will be in addition to your concerns prototyping costs. Interested parties are requested to submit two copies of a summary of the capabilities and facilities they have which will allow them to perform the development and manufacture (or reverse engineering and prototype) of the new EHV.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and an estimate of the anticipated time between contract award and first flight article delivery are solicited as an aid in the budgeting process.  The cost and schedule estimates are for planning purposes only and the contractor will not be bound by these preliminary estimates.  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that procurement will be accomplished.  THIS INFORMATION MUST BE RECEIVED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS FROM THE DATE THIS NOTICE IS PUBLISHED.  The government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No telephone or fax responses will be accepted.  Input and output requirements describing the current EHV is available for reference.
Actual EHV articles will be available to interested respondents as GFP issued equipment; please coordinate the requesting and shipping of these samples through the programmatic/engineering POC.

<DESC>Drug Interaction Checker for Consumers
Release Date:  September 19, 2005
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
National Library of Medicine

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION -  Drug Interaction Checker for Consumers

This Request For Information (RFI)/Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  The purpose of this RFI/SS is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  NLM welcomes comments from all individuals on each or all of these questions.  The NLM does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NLM’s use of such information.   Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NLM’s evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this RFI/SS, the NLM may issue a Request for Proposal(RFP).  In the event a RFP will be issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519, 541511 or 511210 may apply.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the NLM shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the NLM’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. 

Request for Information: 

The NLM seeks input and comment on a drug interaction checker for users of its MedlinePlus consumer health web site.  MedlinePlus already provides information on individual drugs and classes of drugs, and users access these pages over 3 million times per month on average.  The pages include information on side effects and precautions but at this time, MedlinePlus has no section where a user can type in or select medications and receive information on possible interactions and their severity.

To aid in the design of a possible future solicitation, we ask that interested organizations submit comments on the following issues: 

1.	Do you have a commercially available drug interaction checker written for a consumer audience? If so, is the interaction checker available for viewing on any public web site?
2.	What measures do you use to calibrate the reading level of the information you are providing?
3.	If you have a drug interaction checker but it is not written for a consumer audience, would you consider adapting it for such an audience?
4.	How many substances are listed in the interaction checker? Does the interaction checker include prescription drugs? Over-the-counter drugs? Brand names? Generic names?
5.	Does the interaction checker also include information about interactions with nutrients, dietary supplements, alcohol, and herbals? If so, can users include or exclude results for these categories? 
6.	What is the source of the drug interaction checker? Do you develop it in-house or do you acquire the data from another organization?
7.	Who writes the information? What are the qualifications of the person(s) who does the writing? If the interaction checker is available for viewing on a public web site, are the contributors listed there?
8.	Does the interaction checker list the sources of information that are used in 
a.	general preparation of the interaction information?
b.	specific sources for information for each interaction?
9.	Does the interaction checker list the potential severity of interactions? If it does, on what basis is the severity rating based?
10.	Does the interaction checker include a description of symptoms associated with an interaction? 
11.	Does the interaction checker recommend any course of action or management of interactions? Does the information stipulate that it does not constitute medical advice and to consult a health professional?
12.	In what languages other than English is the interaction checker available?
13.	Can users enter multiple drugs? How do they enter them—type in names (if so, is a spellchecker available), pick from a list (if so, are multiple formulations available and are generics as well as brand names available)?
14.	Does the interaction checker allow a user to see all of the potential interactions of an individual drug?
15.	How is the information updated? How often is it updated?
16.	What are the provisions for emergency updating of content?
17.	How is content delivered technically? Do you provide an application program interface (API) for other organizations or do you provide data to other organizations that are then responsible for programming?
18.	Is the interaction checker integrated with any other drug information product? If so, please describe.
19.	Based on the current use of MedlinePlus drug pages, can you give us an estimate of what it would cost to license your interaction checker? NLM prefers flat fee licenses.
20.	Based on the description provided in this RFI, what NAICS code would the proposed drug interaction checker best qualify as? 

NLM welcomes responses from all individuals and organizations on each or all of these questions.  Responses should be limited to approximately one (1) page per question, and are due November 22, 2005.  

Sources Sought: 

Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 10 pages that details the ability to perform the aspects of the effort described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit hospital, or other nonprofit organization, in their response.  

Responses should be identified with NLM-RFI2006-04, and are due by November 22, 2005.  Please submit three (3) copies of your response to the attention of: Sally Boakye, Contract Specialist, The National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisition Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bldg. 38A, Room B1N17, Bethesda, MD 20894.

<SUBJECT>D -- The Emergency Managers Weather Information (EMWIN)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-2005-EMWIN-RFI
<RESPDATE>101805
<CONTACT>Paquetta Myrick-Hancock, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-3405, Fax 301-713-1024, Email Paquetta.N.Myrick-Hancock@noaa.gov
<DESC>PURPOSE - This RFI is being issued to identify potential sources and products capable of enabling the public to receive and utilize NWS essential weather information.  It will allow the NWS to determine the interest of prospective manufacturers in designing, constructing and marketing systems for the reception of the Emergency Managers Weather Information (EMWIN) datastream or for software to make that information more valuable to EMWIN users.  The EMWIN satellite broadcast in its present form through the NOAA Geostationary Orbital Environmental Satellites (GOES) must undergo a change when the new generation of satellites is placed into service sometime on or before 2011.  Existing EMWIN receiving systems must be adapted or replaced to make the transition to the new satellite broadcast.    The NWS wishes to identify and inform a community of potential offerors who have an interest in marketing low cost and reliable products capable of accommodating the transition.

BACKGROUND – What is EMWIN? – The EMWIN system is a popular dissemination system providing a serial bit stream containing timely watches, warnings, forecasts, hydro-meteorological products, graphics and satellite imagery. The EMWIN data stream is prioritized to meet the needs of emergency managers. EMWIN uses NOAA’s GOES satellites and economical receive systems to disseminate and process this bit stream. L-band Satellite broadcast is accomplished via GOES-East and GOES-West and also rebroadcast in Pacific via PeaceSat.  In addition to L-band satellite broadcast, portions of the EMWIN data stream are also rebroadcast via VHF radio, in certain areas, and via the internet in it’s entirety via internet push technology.  Additional information may be found at:   http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/index.htm.
EMWIN Satellite Broadcast - The current EMWIN broadcast modulation is Dual Frequency Shift Keying (DFSK) at a user data rate of 9.6 kbps.  The service is transmitted from the GOES satellites using an L-band down-link frequency at 1690.725 MHz.  Additional information may be found at the following address:  http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/WINSAT.HTM

What must change? - Changes in the next series of GOES satellites, the GOES-N thru P constellation, have necessitated development of a service to be offered as a replacement and upgrade to the existing broadcast.  All current EMWIN users will need to migrate to newer technologies due to frequency, power and modulation changes.  In addition, EMWIN users and contractors have also stressed the importance of increasing the EMWIN data rate and keeping the cost of the GOES-N transition as low as possible.

PREPARATION FOR TRANSITION - EMWIN System Design & specifications – Working with NESDIS, the NWS has developed a system design and specifications for the use of potential offerors.   The next generation broadcast, EMWIN-N is a digital direct broadcast service with a frequency of 1692.7MHz.   The broadcast will be offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) modulation and convolutional rate 1/2 plus Reed Solomon forward error correction for additional gain.  The user data rate will be 19.2 kbps.  Details of the design and specification are now available at the following link:  http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc. 
 
Proof-of-Concept Development – To demonstrate the feasibility of a receiving system capable of meeting the new EMWIN system design, NESDIS has developed and constructed a proof-of-concept model system using hardware implementation for the intermediate-frequency (IF) conversion and a software-defined radio scheme for the demodulation.  Detailed information on the proof-of-concept design may be found within the specification at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc.  It is the intent of NWS to make the Demodulation and Decoding software and the dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that were developed available to the public at no charge.  The software may be downloaded at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/EMWIN-N%20OQPSK%20software.htm.  Potential offerors are free to develop any alternative scheme which meets the system design and specification criteria.
Launch of GOES-N Satellite – The proof-of-concept model has been successfully bench-tested and further tests will be conducted after the launch of the GOES-N satellite on or about early September, 2005.   The results of these tests will be posted, when available, at:  
http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWINtstReptGOES-N.doc.  After completion of these tests, the GOES-N satellite will be placed in storage until required to replace the generation of GOES satellites still in service.  These older satellites will be replaced by the new generation on or before 2011, depending upon fuel consumption, premature failure or demand for capabilities only present in the new satellites.  Before being placed into operational service, the GOES-N satellite will be activated each year for a test period.

INVITATION – Potential offerors who may have an interest in exploring possible development of EMWIN products compatible with the new generation of GOES satellites are encouraged to send an e-mail expressing their interest and any questions to emwin.system@noaa.gov.  No telephone calls please!
These e-mails will be used to develop a mailing list to be used by the NWS in disseminating additional information on EMWIN and the GOES satellite evolution and as part of a list of those invited to participate in an EMWIN conference to be held in Silver Spring, MD in late 2005.
  
E-mail responses should include the following information:

1) Brief description of firm and current similar product lines;
2) Firm’s URL;
3) Any questions; and
4) An expression of interest in being on the mailing list and possible participation in a forthcoming conference in Silver Spring, MD in late 2005.

Submissions are due no later than October 18, 2005.

Interested parties who market EMWIN related products will be identified on a list of potentital offerors posted on the EMWIN website but without any endorsement by NWS.   

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES - Additional information on the EMWIN program and transition may be found on the EMWIN website located at the following address:

http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/index.htm.

DISCLAIMER – This RFI is issued by NWS solely for obtaining information for planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Proprietary information must not be submitted and  will not be accepted by NWS.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Interested parties are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Furthermore, no basis for claims against NWS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or NWS’s use of such information.

Description

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM), Patuxent River, Maryland, is seeking information from firms that are capable of providing Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliant rocket motor products/technology for the Zuni 5-inch rocket.  This request for information (RFI) is part of a market survey required for the Congressionally-mandated Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program.  The FCT program provides funds for comparative testing of non-developmental foreign defense equipment to determine whether foreign products are available which can satisfy current U. S. military requirements.  Since the FCT program compares foreign company products against U.S. products for best value to the military, U.S. companies are also encouraged to respond to this RFI.  See Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Comparative Testing Office (CTO) website at http://www.acq.osd.mil/sts/fct/ for details on the FCT program.  NAVAIR understands it is unlikely that an off-the-shelf Zuni IM compliant rocket motor exists or that one can be developed in time for the FY07 FCT cycle.  Therefore, in lieu of an IM compliant Zuni rocket motor, NAVAIR request respondents provide information on IM products/ technology that could be demonstrated in the FY07 FCT program, and later be tailored to fit the Zuni 5-inch rocket application.  Request all interested companies who have IM compliant rocket motor products/technology, including propellant, igniter, and rocket motor case designs respond to this RFI.  Should favorable responses to this RFI be obtained, it is NAVAIR’s intention to submit an FY07 FCT proposal in January 2006.  NAVAIR anticipates that the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) will make final FY07 FCT selections by August 2006, and Congress will approve these selections in September 2006.  If the IM compliant rocket motor FY07 FCT proposal is selected by OSD and approved by Congress, we expect funds to become available in January 2007.  At which time, NAVAIR would identify its acquisition strategy for an IM compliant rocket motor product/technology demonstration.  Multiple sources may be selected, and their products tested, to ensure that the government is getting the best value.  

Zuni 5-inch Rocket Motor Requirements:  NAVAIR is seeking sources for an IM compliant (MIL-STD-2105C) Zuni 5-inch rocket motor for use by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps on fixed and rotary wing aircraft.  The primary aircraft are the F/A-18 Hornet Strike/Fighter and the AH-1 Super Cobra attack helicopter.  The new motor must be able to operate in its intended fixed wing and rotary wing environments without additional captive carriage and weapon release flight restrictions.  As a minimum, the rocket motor will have the same form, fit, and structural properties as the current Mk71 Mod 2 rocket motor. The new IM compliant rocket motor and the Zuni Mk 71 Mod 2 rocket motors shall be interchangeable.    It must be compatible with both the LAU-10C/A and LAU-10D/A launchers.   The rocket motor must be able to be safely transported, stored, and handled aboard U.S. Navy surface combatants.  It shall be suitable for carrier operations (i.e.; catapult takeoffs and arrested landings).  The rocket motor must be Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) ‘Safe’, and meet the shipboard shock requirements of MIL-S-901. The rocket motor must be acceptable for shipboard CONREP and VERTREP operations.   The motor must survive and operate in a variety of natural and induced environmental conditions that are possible during storage, transport, and tactical operations.  The motor must be capable of operating in battlefield conditions to include snow, ice, rain, sand, dust, salt fog and battlefield contaminants.  Induced battlefield environments include Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3), and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC).   The new rocket motor will meet the ballistic requirements of the Propellant Grain Mk 88 Mod 0 Product Specification, WS 33726 (provided in enclosure 1), and the overall rocket motor requirements of the Rocket Motor, 5.0 Inch, MK 71 Mods Product Specification, WS 33725 (provided in enclosure 2).

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS AN 8(a) SET-ASIDE; 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SIZE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.  The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research to understand, and ultimately prevent and/or treat, infectious and immune-mediated diseases that continue to threaten millions of lives each year.   The Bacteriology and Mycology Branch (BMB) has a contract entitled “Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA)” currently being performed by Focus Technologies, Inc. under NIAID Contract N01-AI-95359 since April 12, 1999.  It is the intent of the BMB to recompete the NARSA contract and make one (1) award for a period of seven (7) years.  The current NARSA contract, due to expire on April 11, 2007, established a repository of staphylococcal strains important to public health and research.  This repository of staphylococcal isolates with associated historical case information is available to researchers to use to the fullest potential to increase knowledge and affect prudent clinical management approaches for minimizing antimicrobial resistance.  NARSA also includes a website www.narsa.net and communication capacity to link basic scientists, epidemiologists, clinical microbiologists, and clinicians working in the area of staphylococcal diseases and antibiotic resistance, thereby encouraging collaborative research across disciplines of science, public health and medicine.  Other NARSA activities include strain characterization; establishment and maintenance of a registry of S. aureus case information; the evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods; establishment of a NARSA Scientific Working Group to provide guidance and oversight of NARSA activities; and coordination of annual investigator meetings which is open to any interested party. The NARSA network of investigators currently consists of 190 NARSA Affiliate Members (researchers approved to order NARSA strains) and 71 NARSA Core Members (researchers receiving NIAID grant/contract support to study S. aureus). At present, the NARSA repository maintains 216 strains, and ships approximately 100 samples monthly, with one-third shipped abroad.  Oracle databases store the information for the NARSA Strain Repository, the NARSA Case-History Registry, and NARSA membership information. At the time of the first contract, there was no systematic collection and distribution system for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. NARSA has filled this gap and it is important to maintain and update this resource for the research community.  Researchers will continue to need ready and reliable access to well characterized isolates as well as an ability to easily communicate and interact with other researchers.  The original NARSA repository collected isolates of interest for S. aureus fully resistant to vancomycin (VRSA); however, in the contract to be awarded under this RFP, the repository will collect and distribute isolates of clinical, public health and research importance to antibiotic resistance in S. aureus.  The repository will also acquire and distribute other reagents which the Scientific Working Group deem helpful to the research community in advancing research on antibiotic resistant S. aureus.  Information submitted in your capability statement shall be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration in each of the following qualifications:  (1) facility and expertise for the handling of infectious microbial agents; (2) informatics expertise for database maintenance and updating; web design and implementation; (3) online ordering and database query; and (4) scientific conference organization and execution.  Small business and 8(a) contractors are reminded that in order to quality as a set-aside, 51% of the direct labor must be performed by the prime contractor.  It is anticipated that an anticipated total effort of approximately 1.35 FTEs will be needed to accomplish this project.  Interested organizations are encouraged to respond and are required to submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing the areas cited above.  Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence and identify the NAICS and size status of your organization.  See Government-Wide Numbered Note 22.  NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR MAKING PYROPHORIC METAL USING SOL-GEL CHEMISTRY
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR MAKING PYROPHORIC METAL USING SOL-GEL CHEMISTRY

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to make pyrophoric metal using sol-gel chemistry.

Researchers at LLNL have developed an environmentally friendly method to produce high surface area, porous, nanometer sized pyrophoric metals using sol-gel chemistry.   The sol-gel method permits the manufacturer of individual or combinations of metals.  The metals produced by this method include iron and zirconium and many others.  This is potentially useful for pyrotechnic applications such as decoy flares, illuminating flares, colored flares, smokes, igniters/starters and miscellaneous pyrotechnic items.

The method for making the pyrophoric metals starts by using sol-gel chemistry to make nanostructured metal oxides.    A published US patent application (#20040060626, filed Apr. 1, 2004, Serial No. 422488, Series No. 10) describes a method for producing highly porous nanocomposite metal oxides.   Basically, sol-gel chemistry utilizes the hydrolysis and condensation of molecular chemical precursors, in solution, to produce nanometer-sized primary particles, called "sols". Through further condensation the "sols" are linked to form a three-dimensional solid network, referred to as a "gel", with the solvent liquid present in its pores. A final step of drying then extracts the solvent liquid from the network.  

Sol-gel materials are distinctive in that they typically posses high surface areas, high porosities and small primary particle size. The properties unique to sol-gel materials lead to their enhanced reactivity. Sol-gel chemical routes are very attractive because they offer low temperature routes to synthesize homogeneous materials with variable compositions, morphologies, and densities.
 
After producing the nanostructured metal oxides, the LLNL method then produces the pyrophoric metal by reducing the metal oxide to pure metal.   Under a unique set of conditions this transformation can be done while retaining the desirable sol-gel material properties of high surface areas, high porosities as well as the small particle size.   

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's technology to make pyrophoric metal using sol-gel chemistry should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 111-05

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in technology to make pyrophoric metal using sol-gel chemistry.

<SUBJECT>75 -- FSC 7510 - FPI Plastic File Folders Follow-up
<DESC>On September 28, 2005, Federal Prison Industries, Inc (FPI) posted a “good faith” notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) in response to an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  In this notice, FPI proposed to manufacture plastic file folders for sale competitively to DHS, without mandatory source.

The notice indicated that under FPI's guidelines covering the production of new products and significant expansion of existing products, the primary determinant of what constitutes a "specific product" is an item's Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code.  Plastic file folders fall within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 7510 - Office Supplies.  FPI has recorded sales in this category every year since FY 1989.  The most appropriate SIC codes for plastic file folders is SIC 3089 - Plastic Products, Not Elsewhere Classified. 

The notice also highlighted that FPI had a history of making similar items in the FSC code for plastic file folders.  Previously,  FPI had produced items in the relevant SIC code as well.  For that reason, FPI believed plastic file folders did not meet the definition of "new product" set forth by FPI's guidelines.  However, FPI recognized that a reasonable person may construe this item to be a product separate and distinct from any other made by FPI. 

FPI received no comments from interested parties regarding this proposed production within the 21 days allowed as stated in the September 28, 2005 FedBizOpps notice.  Therefore, FPI will provide plastic folders competitively to DHS, without mandatory source. 

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<SUBJECT>99 -- FPI - Two New Categories for Commercial Market Services Follow-up
<DESC>On September 12, 2005, Federal Prison Industries (FPI) posted a notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) regarding FPI’s request that the FPI Board of Directors (the Board) approve two additional types of services which FPI will perform outside the Federal market. 

The notice stated that in September of 1998, FPI received approval from its Board of Directors and legal concurrence from the U.S. Department of Justice to provide commercial market services (CMS) in four specific service areas.  The areas include: 1) work that is currently being performed outside the United States; 2) services with a recognized labor shortage that causes companies to outsource work to foreign countries; 3) new services that a company otherwise intends to contract outside the United States; and 4) services that were performed by non-Federal Bureau of Prisons inmates (such as District of Columbia inmates) for non-Federal agencies. 

On August 25, 2005, FPI requested that the Board approve two additional categories in the area of commercial market services:  service work for state and local governments, and service work that would be economically unfeasible to perform without the availability of inmate labor.  The notice stated that the approval of the two new categories is contingent on public review.  As with other FPI CMS projects, there will be no displacement of United States workers in either category as a result of FPI’s work nor will any potential partnership hinder the development of the domestic market.  

The notice stated that in the case of service work to state and local governments, FPI did not anticipate a great amount of work from this category, but would like to be available to assist state and local agencies if they express an interest in having FPI address their service needs.  FPI will work closely with its counterparts in state correctional industries programs and with the National Correctional Industries Association, to ensure that the interests of the state programs are protected.  

The September 12th notice explained that for service work that is economically unfeasible without the availability of inmate labor, this type of service work is not currently being, or likely to be, performed because it is not economically feasible in the commercial marketplace.  An example of this work would be for FPI to provide a variety of labor-intensive cleaning, repair, and repackaging services for a broad array of consumer goods which have been returned by customers.  Ordinarily, it is too expensive to return the items to new condition, and associated costs make having the work done outside the United States economically impractical.  Currently, these consumer goods are being disposed of by throwing them away, donating them to charitable organizations, or selling them through outlet stores. 

FPI allowed 45 days for the public to comment and received two comments from state officials.   The first comment expressed the possibility of partnering with FPI on service initiatives.  The other comment, to which we responded, inquired on the process FPI would use to notify state correctional industries of requests for services from the state and local governments.  Based on the positive nature of the comments and the fact that no adversarial comments were received, the Board of Directors has approved FPI to add the two new categories to its commercial market services.  

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<DESC>SAP003-000HCN38-2006-27242 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to Miriam Hospital / Lifespan Office of Research Administration, 593 Ebby Street, Aldrich 3, Providence, RI 02903. The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR 13.106-1.  The CDC intends to conduct a study in Rhode Island that will provide information relevant to the correlation between environmental concerns and health issues involving chronic, episodic, and acute pathophysiological conditions; and/or traumatic injury in the home. Rhode Island was chosen due to its small geographical region, and based on current census studies suggesting that most residents seldom relocate out of state or move to another jurisdiction or county within the state. 
 Miriam Hospital will be required to identify and evaluate various surveys, instrument or tools that can be used to monitor housing quality and the resident’s health status. Miriam Hospital will provide documentation in the form of technical guide based on a pre-approved format. This published guide (A Guide to Healthy Homes Tools) will be used to assess housing conditions as it relates to the impact on the occupant’s health. For more information on the CDC Healthy Home program, see www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/healthyhome.htm 
Miriam Hospital was chosen to provide these services based on the believe that they are the only vendor within the designated geographical region that posses the required experience working with local health, residential and environmental issues. Miriam Hospital is the only vendor believed to posses the necessary clinical and technical skills required to accomplish this work in a timely manner with accurate results.
Firms that believe they can provide these services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of the publication date of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquires may be sent to Russell Oxford by e-mail at efn3@cdc.gov or by fax to 770-488-2670.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN06-08 - Sustained Littoral Presence (SLP) Program
<DESC>PROPOSERS’ DAY ANNOUNCEMENT
SUSTAINED LITTORAL PRESENCE (SLP) PROGRAM

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) will sponsor a Proposers’ Day conference in support of the Sustained Littoral Presence (SLP) program on 30 November 2005, from 8:30 AM until 4:30 PM, located at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association facility located at 4301 Wilson Boulevard, Lobby Level, Arlington, VA 22203.  The purpose of the event is to provide information on the program, promote additional discussion on the associated research topics, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to identify teaming opportunities.

The SLP program objectives are: (1) to develop sustainable, microbial fuel cells (bottom mounted and in the water column) to generate continuous, unattended power for greater than 10 years in both ocean and fresh water regions and (2) to develop unique mobile surveillance systems that utilize these novel microbial power plants and operate with a high degree of autonomy, stealth, and weather tolerance with minimum cost and manpower risk.  These SLP objectives will be achieved through the development of enabling technologies and the integration of said technologies into systems via a phased, multiyear program.  System and technology areas of interest include: instruments to identify and determine concentrations of chemical reactants and reductants in real time and in situ in marine sediments and adjacent waters; instruments to characterize environmental processes and related parameters in real time and in situ in marine sediments and adjacent waters (temperature, salinity, pressure); models and simulations to represent the parameter space and processes required to produce reliable power from microbial fuel cells in laboratories and in situ in coastal waters; fuel cell components (electrode materials, surfaces, and coatings); fuel cell power monitoring, conditioning, processing, and storage; location and characterization of plankton type and concentration in water column; plankton filtering in water; extraction of oxygen and methane gases from ocean and fresh water; microbial conversion of methane gas to liquid methanol, in situ in marine environments; microbial conversion of methane gas to hydrogen, in situ in marine environments; bottom mounted microbial fuel cell systems; water column microbial fuel cell systems; amphibious vehicles with integral microbial fuel cell systems; and water column vehicles with integral microbial fuel cell systems.
  
For additional information on the SLP program, reference DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 06-12, and the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which DARPA plans on publishing before the Proposers’ Day conference.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The agency’s need for the Drug Abuse Treatment Protocol Journals listed above can only be provided by one source (The Change Companies).

The Change Companies designed and developed the Drug Abuse Treat Protocol Journals.  The journals are copyrighted and may not be reproduced or utilized in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, including photocopying, without written permission from The Change Companies.  The BOP now has a requirement to receive these journals and The Change Companies is the only available source who can fulfill the BOP’s requirement.
