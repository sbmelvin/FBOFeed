The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery type firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />Period of Performance shall be from award through twelve (12) months.<br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. <br /><br />The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is an intramural research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) that conducts population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. Through its programs in cancer epidemiology, genetics, statistics, and related areas, the Division conducts high-quality, high-impact research, responds to public health concerns identified by the Institute, Congress, and national agencies, and develops resources and trains the next generation of scientists in cancer epidemiology and genetics.<br /><br />The goal of the Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG) is to dissect the genetic basis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) validated in large scale, genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This approach will identify new regions to be studied in great detail and eventually applied to large molecular epidemiology studies to estimate the magnitude of the effect.<br /><br />To accomplish this goal, thousands of patient DNA samples are sequenced each year to identify common gene variants, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This genotyping is done using a well-established, high-throughput DNA sequencing platform that utilizes a 3730xl genetic analyzer. This instrument sequences DNA by capillary electrophoresis and allows us to sequence 96 samples simultaneously.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide a minimum of one (1) and a maximum of four (4) BigDye Terminator version 3.1 (BDT) cycle sequencing kit. The BDT been used for over nine years in the LTG and has provided high-accuracy base assignments for comparative sequencing applications, namely SNP identification. The lab receives various types of DNA extracts from all over the world that require sequencing, so it is imperative that the sequencing chemistry performs well on a wide range of template types and qualities. BDT allows this, and it also tackles complex, repetitive sequence patterns that are often seen. Applied Biosystems is the only source known to NCI that can provide the BDT that is compatible with the current sequencing platform (3730xl genetic analyzer, Applied Biosystems) and is compatible with both data collection software (v3.0) and sequence analysis software (v5.2) housed in the laboratory. The purchase of this supply allows for consistency in data collection needed to continue the mission of the NCI DCEG. <br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM EST, on February 7, 2012. For further information, please contact Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies regarding the generation, storage, handling, and delivery of liquid oxygen (LOX) to the end using hardware from both shipboard and/or from waterfront structures.  NAVFAC ESC is seeking to identify qualified sources which offer potential for advancement and improvement of Navy and Marine Corps operations through the development of such systems for supporting the at-sea operation of fuel cell powered Navy hardware.  Whether or not the various processes from the production through delivery of the liquid oxygen product to the end using hardware are conducted shipboard, or from a waterfront structure, will depend upon many factors, including the specific hardware type, the concept of operations (CONOPS), and the operational tempo (OPTEMPO).
  At this time, the Navy does not want to artificially preclude any potential solutions, and therefore is seeking technologies and methodologies that are applicable to being conducted from either shipboard, or from a waterfront structure, or from both.         

The term shipboard environments is meant to encompass operations from Navy, Military Sealift Command (MSC), and commercial platforms.  The term waterfront structure is meant to encompass the various facilities that support the naval mission such as berthing facilities that support ships and craft (e.g., piers, and wharves). The term LOX delivery systems is meant to encompass equipment and methods to deliver the LOX to the fuel cell/using hardware (end user) and potentially include mobile LOX carts to transport the LOX product from the producer to the end user; and piping, tubing, and/or hose systems for LOX transport from the producer or cart to the end user.
          

To be eligible for consideration and possible contract award, the technology or methodology shall be in either basic research (Category 6.1), applied research (Category 6.2), advanced technology development not for a specific system/hardware (Category 6.3A.  Furthermore, the technology or methodology shall address the performance areas cited in the attachments.

<DESC>In coordination with the Joint Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Board and the JCREW 3.3 Program Office, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) is soliciting applied research proposals to develop and demonstrate technologies to improve virtually all aspects of performance related to next generation JCREW equipment. ONR seeks to improve counter-Radio Controlled IED (counter-RCIED) effectiveness by developing radio frequency (RF) related operational capabilities, including simultaneous transmit and receive, on-mission wireless communications, interoperability with blue force communications, comprehensive spectral awareness, and improved packaging.
<p>The proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in technologies that support electronic warfare (EW) and communication systems, both single unit and distributed. New RF modules, RF components, system configurations, digital signal processing, and onboard decision making enabled by these BAA efforts will be key to future JCREW electronic battlefield success.</p>

<p>Wright-Patterson Air Force Base anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide BAK-12 aircraft arresting system and the Portarrest IV/BAK-12 Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS) to be delivered to bases in Poland and Morocco.</p>
<p>Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide the following items:</p>
<p>Aircraft arresting systems are installed along runway and overruns of all airfields that support fighter and training aircraft. Aircraft arresting systems are used to bring disabled aircraft safely to a complete stop on their own. Item 1, the BAK-12 aircraft arresting system is a permanent arresting system installed in pits or sheds alongside the runway and is used to bring disabled aircraft to a safe stop when pilots are unable to. Item 2, the Portarrest IV/BAK-12 MAAS, is a mobile and temporary arresting system designed to provide the capability of moving into geographic sites that do not have standard aircraft landing facilities allowing for establishment of an aircraft retrieval system within hours.</p>
<p>The following items are required for this program:</p>
<p>1. BAK-12 Aircraft Arresting System 2 Ea <br />2. BAK-12 MAAS 1 Ea <br />3. Spares <br />4. Technical Assistance in Project &amp; Design Oversight <br />5. Site Surveys</p>

All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DOD contract. No set-aside decision has been made.

Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</p>
<p>Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit packages that outline their capability to provide the required items.

<DESC>US Army  RDECOM - ARDEC, Fire Control Systems & Technology Directorate, Small Unit Combat Systems Division, of Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is conducting a market survey on behalf of PM Individual Weapons, Precision Weapons Division, to identify potential sources for a Mirage Mitigation Device (MMD)/Suppressor Sleeve.
	U.S. Army Snipers have a requirement for a Mirage Mitigation Device (MMD) to minimize suppressor heat mirage, which reduces the ability to identify and engage targets as well as estimate wind speed and direction down range when using high power optics. Proposed device should be constructed using heat resistant / insulating material. The high thermal resistance of the material should allow for slow thermal transfer from the inside to the outside of the thermal wrap, thus permitting item handling under high temperature / high rate of fire operating conditions. Additional benefits should include the minimization of bodily injury and burn damage to clothing and carrying packs due to unintentional contact with the hot suppressor. The MMD is a new capability that will ultimately increase a snipers vision, effectiveness and survivability.
RequirementsThe device is required to interface with the suppressor of the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System (SASS). The current suppressor has the following rough dimensions: Length 14.125, body diameter 1.375, horseshoe clamp diameter 1.55. The device should also include or be able to perform within the following parameters:
a)	Mirage Reduction: MMD shall not melt or show extreme signs of mirage (sniper not able to identify a target) emanating from the suppressor after firing 50 rounds at a rate of fire of 1 round every 2-3 seconds at a range of 100 meters.b)	Heat Reduction: Sniper shall be able to grasp the covered suppressor with gloved hand after firing 50 rounds at specified rate above.c)	Durability: MMD shall last throughout a year of combat operations defined as approximately 448 hours of use with an anticipated 2910 rounds fired through the host SASS.d)	Attachment Capability: MMD shall attach by either sliding directly over the suppressor or wrapping around the suppressor and shall remain securely in place (does not slide off/back due to over pressure/gasses exiting the suppressor) while firing the weapon system.e)	Weight: MMD shall not weigh more than 8oz.f)	Survivability: MMD shall survive in operational military environments in accordance with the latest MIL-STD-810.
MMD shall be a Non Developmental Item (NDI) or a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) item. Primary interest is in a device designed for use with no modification to the weapons configuration including the suppressor. However, information for products that require minimal modification may also be provided. The MMD shall not cause damage to the sniper weapon system or suppressor due to overheating or melting of the material.
ResponseFirms/companies are invited to indicate their capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, demonstration video and other technical data as well as identification of current customers and rough indication of pricing. Any pricing data should be sent, if available, and at no cost to the US Government. In addition, if any firms/companies would like to submit sample hardware they may do so, but are not required.   If any firms/companies do submit sample hardware it will be at NO COST to the US Government.  Any hardware submitted in response to this Market Survey will not be returned.
Interested companies are requested to submit a capabilities statement of 2-5 pages via e-mail by 24 February 2012.  The Point of Contact is Jessica Parker at jessica.d.parker@us.army.mil. No phone calls will be accepted at this time.  Interested firms should also provide their address, point-of-contact with telephone number and e-mail address, and size of business (small/large).  This is a market survey for information only and shall not be construed as a request for a proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government.  The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.  This is a request for information only, not a solicitation.  There is no guarantee that a solicitation will be issued at any point.

<DESC>****ATTENTION****ALL FORMAL COMMUNICATION RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION MUST BE DIRECTED TO: Darryl Wright, Contract Specialist, email: darryl.wright2@us.army.mil.  No telephone calls will be accepted. The Army Contracting Command-Redstone proposes to award a contract for tactical and non-tactical, Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) Base Shop Test Facility (BSTF)/Commercial Equivalent Equipment (CEE)/Electro-Optics Test Station (EOTS)/Electro-Optics Test Facility (EOTF)/Next Generation Automated Test System (NGATS) Repair and Calibration of Secondary Items for Fiscal Year 2012 through FY 2016, by other than full and open competition to Northrop Grumman Corporation, 600 Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL  60008-1098, (Cage Code: 26916).  The new contract will be a five-year contract consisting of the repair and calibration items which are planned to be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) requirements type contract.  The repair of tactical and non-tactical Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) will have a maximum ceiling for number of repairs.  The repair and calibration portion of this contract cannot be adequately defined to develop a fixed price as there are various levels of repair required.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Northrop Grumman Corp.  The Government suggest that small business firms, or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with this procurement, make contact with the firm(s) listed.  This acquisition covers potential future requirements for five (5) years; however, this does not preclude the Government from ordering the maximum quantity at any time during the requirements period.  Orders will be issued one or more times as repair and return materialize.<br>Below is the complete listing of Repair and Calibration items:<br> <br> 	NSN	PART NUMBER/MODEL

A.  Pre-survey document review: (Upon Notice to proceed)

Meet with Facility and Safety staff to perform the following:
Review of all existing SOC documentation both electronic and hard copy  plans, current basic building information (BBI), plan for improvement (PFI), and equivalencies before the field survey. 
Identify any apparent code violations on the drawings or SOC documentation including exiting, smoke compartmentation, and input on the equivalencies (recent code changes which might impact the need for the equivalencies).
Review VAs response to any identified any apparent issues and adjust the survey plan, if necessary, to add any required areas of emphasis to the survey.





B.  Field survey

Survey of Buildings 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 26, walking all areas of the facility identifying fire code deficiencies with respect to sprinkler placement, fire alarm device placement and fire door rating and operation.

Modify architectural drawings provided by the VA to show all fire rated walls from the current SOC drawings which are in a .pdf format.
Add other elements to the drawings, such as exit identification, smoke compartment zone identification and smoke compartment sizes which the Joint Commission has indicated it expects to find on the SOC drawings at every facility.
Copy of Electronic CAD format on CD of updated SOC drawings identifying the above mentioned information.
Hard copy of the updated SOC drawings with correct title block and licensed Fire Safety Engineer (PE) stamp and approval signature form company. 


D.  Not covered under this contract:

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BACKGROUND:<br /></strong>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Strategic Human Resources, and Operating Divisions have a requirement for Commercial-Off-the Shelf (COTS) accounting and tax law training courses in an E-learning (Web-based learning, computer-based learning, virtual education opportunities and digital collaboration) format for IRS employees. These courses will allow IRS employees to obtain and retain their professional certifications, to update their knowledge, and to develop a depth of technical competence in specialized areas of the legal and accounting professions. The contractor is required to have a proven background in producing a wide range of materials in this area and the ability to provide training courses in an E-learning format.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IRS employees have an on-going requirement for Continuing Professional Education (CPE). Research shows that the most efficient and cost effective method to provide such training and education is via COTS, E-Learning training modules. IRS employees need access to training courses that will allow them to choose from an appropriate range of professional specialties. Employees who are Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) must obtain CPE credits each year to maintain their certification. Employees use E-learning courses to help them prepare for the CPA Examination. Employees use CPEs to learn about new issues, stay abreast of industry changes and tax law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>SCOPE OF WORK:<br /></strong>This Statement of Work encompasses the creation and establishment of access to E-learning format and media that will provide training modules for CPE and CPA certification purposes of IRS employees that work in examination, compliance, collection, and/or tax-customer-service functions. The contractor shall provide support as required to update and maintain the training tools at a level of professional development in conformance with the IRS's training requirements in the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) Learning and Education section.</p>
<p>The individual training modules requests will be controlled by the approval&nbsp;of designated IRS training coordinators. The contractor will be responsible for delivering all training modules in conformance with this Sources Sought. All technical and support services must adhere to IRS standards and methodologies. The requirement includes, but is not limited to the following:<br />&bull; Provide a vast selection of E-learning training modules in the areas of Accounting, Auditing, Taxation, CPA Exam Review, and related areas. <br />&bull; Establish an ordering system to include online and off-line ordering capabilities. For Site License proposals, this will be the method of determining whose site licenses should be tracked <br />&bull; Modify and upgrade specific training modules in conformance with IRS tax law changes<br />&bull; Design and develop specialized tax modules to meet Business Segment Specialization needs<br />&bull; Customize products according to embedded IRS procedures, processes, and workshops/scenarios<br />&bull; The contractor must provide individual user support via a Toll-Free Telephone Number during each business day from 9:00am to 6:00pm Eastern Time<br />&bull; Document, transmit and communicate results of changes to the training modules<br />&bull; Generate automated management reports to include:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Monthly activity of training requests and deliveries<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Provide technical assessment and training regarding the use of E-learning and online tools</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>SPECIAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATIONS:<br /></strong>The contractor's Continuing Professional Education (CPE) courses will be accepted for CPE credit for Certified Public Accountants. State Boards of Accounting change from state to state and periodically change their requirements. The contractor must inform the IRS of any State Boards of Accounting changes as they occur. The contractor must design their CPE courses according to the "Statement on Standards for Formal Continuing Professional Education Programs," published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for continuing education hours. The National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) as well as states with specific CPE course requirements must accept the CPE series courses for CPE credits. The CPE courses must also meet the Quality Assurance Service established by NASBA in 1998.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DISCLAIMER:<br /></strong>This is NOT a solicitation announcement; it is a Sources Sought announcement only. As stated in FAR 15.201, responses to Sources Sought are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The decision to release a contract solicitation is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>35--ALTERNATIVE CARD ACCEPTING DEVICE (CAD) FOR VENDING MACHING ON NAVY SHIPS

<RESPDATE>020812
<ARCHDATE>02082012
<CONTACT>JOSEPH CALTAGIRONE - 215-697-9687 - JOSEPH.CALTAGIRONE@NAVY.MIL

<a href="mailto:JOSEPH.CALTAGIRONE@NAVY.MIL">JOSEPH.CALTAGIRONE@NAVY.MIL</a>
<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office is issuing a request for information (RFI) seeking sources to provide an alternative Card Accepting Device (CAD) for vending machines used aboard Navy ships. This announcement is issued for informational and planning purposes only. THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES PROPOSALS AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. Responses to the RFI will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 

Cashless vending machines (soda/snack/stamp) are currently deployed aboard U.S.
 Navy ships and accept a specific bank card containing an Integrated Circuit Chip (ICC) with a stored value e-purse. The Navy is requesting information to determine if alternative CAD devices are available with barcode scanners. The desired cards to be used in the future will contain a linear and 2D barcode. Navy personnel will already have these cards. 

The barcode-reading CAD should essentially be an off-the-shelf, commercially available unit that with minimal modifications can be easily swapped for the present ICC-reading CAD. Navy would not be seeking a lengthy development or modification process that would be required to make a barcode-reading CAD compatible with our ships vending architecture.
 The barcode-reading CAD must be a modular unit that the Navy AIT contractor will install into existing vending machines to replace the current ICC-reading CAD. The new CAD must be compatible with the current physical characteristics regarding size, shape, and power/data connections. Please refer to the attached CAD specification, which describes the present requirements.

The purpose of the card read will be only to obtain the identity of the card holder and to associate it with the purchase value of the vending selection. The identity information read by the CAD, and the purchase value, will be provided in electronic format. The identity and purchase data will be passed electronically via the ships network.
 As long as the CAD is online each purchase will be passed to the server at the time of sale. If the CAD is not online, the identification and purchase information will be stored in the CAD and passed to the server when the CAD does come back online.

THIS RFI PERTAINS ONLY TO THE CAD HARDWARE; CARDS ARE NOT A PART OF THIS RFI. RFI respondents should assume that they will collect the purchase and identification data that the CAD acquires and be capable of passing those data in a format to be determined by the Navy. Navy expects that their own developer will be responsible for accepting the purchase and identification data and handling it from there.

All responding sources shall provide a summary of company capabilities including organization name, address, point of contract (including phone number and e-mail address), business size, DUNS number, CAGE Code, and past experience.
 Responses should also provide a list of how many devices are installed, type of warranty/support is provided, specific types of vending supported (i.e. snacks, drinks, frozen, etc.), and price examples based on the units installed. The NAICs code for this acquisition is 454210 and the size standard is $10M.  All submissions are required to be submitted via e-mail to joseph.caltagirone@navy.mil no later than 3pm (Eastern Standard Time) on 08 February 2012. Please direct any questions concerning this sources sought synopsis to Joseph Caltagirone at 215-697-9687, or joseph.caltagirone@navy.mil.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: TF-HPOD-12-0006
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to FLIR Systems, Inc., for purchase of infrared gas-imaging cameras, telephoto lenses and an extended warranty.
Scope and Capabilities: The objective is to obtain two FLIR GF320 infrared (IR) cameras to use for determining compliance with Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) provisions in the Clean Air Act, including Reference Method 21 monitoring, and other investigative purposes. In addition to the cameras, a telephoto lens for each, for detecting gas releases at greater distances, and a one-year extended warranty on the cameras is required.

<p>NAICS Code: 518210</p>
<p>Response Date: January 27, 2012</p>
<p>Subject: Sole Source Bridge Contract with Akamai Technologies for Public Web Site Content Delivery and Continuity of Operations Services</p>
<p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Akamai Technologies, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts by January 31, 2012 for continuation of critical operational services to maintain and expand assistance to distribute and deliver HTTP content and provide COOP services for the NRC Public Web Site (www.nrc.gov). NRC currently has a contract that expires on January 31, 2012 for these services, and Akamai Technologies is the provider of those services. NRC intends to award a "bridge" contract to Akamai Technologies for continuation of those critical services so that it can ensure that there is no interruption in those services while NRC conducts additional market research to determine appropriate acquisition strategy for a longer-term requirement. The services under the bridge contract will include continued website caching, backup and spidering, content delivery, application scripting, monitoring, reporting tools, and automatic fail-over capabilities 24 hours a day, 365 day a year. The NRC anticipates a firm-fixed-price contract with a period of performance of one year, starting on February 1, 2012, and one (1) six-month option to extend the term of the contract. The authority for this sole source action is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)( 1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Based on NRC's current market research, Akamai Technologies is uniquely qualified to perform NRC's requirements because of the following:</p>
<p>CURRENT COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT (FISMA) OF 2002</p>
<p>The contractor must comply with the requirements for a Moderate risk system as defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-60, Revision 1. Because only domestic (U.S.) companies can be held to FISMA requirements, the company must also be U.S. held. Akamai Technologies holds a current FISMA-moderate certification by at least one U.S. Federal cabinet-level department for requirements materially similar to those of the NRC for this acquisition. Akamai is also an early partner in the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) initiative sponsored by the U.S. Federal Chief Information Officer to develop a common baseline for security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services to reduce the cost or redundant agency security assessments. By participating in the FedRAMP initiative, Akamai has demonstrated its continued commitment to maintaining its FISMA certification in a manner that is cost-effective for its Federal clients. Based on NRC's market research (discussion with other agencies, professional knowledge of the industry, internet searches), the NRC has found no other source besides Akamai Technologies that can provide a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with a current FISMA-Moderate certification or that participates in the FedRAMP initiative.</p>
<p>CONFIDENCE OF LAST MILE DELIVERY</p>
<p>The NRC requires market penetration to ensure that all public site content reaches the Internet Service Provider (ISP) of the end user accurately for users in every country around the world. Akamai Technologies provides end-to-end delivery and control of content with proprietary algorithms that connect over 95,000 Akamai servers strategically distributed in 71 countries on 1,900 networks. Eighty-five percent of all Internet users are within a single "network hop" of an Akamai server to ensure "last-mile" delivery. Based on its market research, NRC has found no other source for a CDN that can demonstrate the ability verify the arrival of NRC content in the ISP of the end user.</p>
<p>CONFIDENCE OF LAST MILE REMOVAL</p>
<p>The NRC requires programmatic tracking and control of all content delivered by or cached on the contractor's CDN servers in host ISPs such that any Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) found at the public site can be removed from all of the contractor's CDN servers in networks world-wide at the client's request. In order to ensure that content requested by the NRC for removal from the public site is in fact purged from ISP servers, the CDN must retain control of that content while at the ISP. Otherwise, if the content is passed to an externally controlled server, the CDN loses control of the content. Akamai Technologies retains control of the content by delivering it using proprietary algorithms on its own CDN servers co-located in the host ISP, rather than relying on the servers of an external partner to deliver the content to the user's ISP. This ensures that Akamai retains control of the cached content until shortly before it reaches the end user. Thus, when content is scheduled for removal or refresh by the NRC, Akamai retains the ability to remove or refresh the content (and to verify the task is complete) at most ISPs worldwide. Based on its market research, NRC has found no other source besides Akamai Technologies that can provide a CDN that can demonstrate the ability to verify the removal of NRC content from the ISPs of most end users.</p>
<p>In addition, the NRC has invested substantial time and effort in the existing configuration and FISMA certification for the Akamai Technologies CDN to support the NRC delivery requirements. The effort needed to migrate, configure, certify for FISMA compliance, and test a new CDN implementation would be cost-prohibitive and would place at risk the NRC's effort to achieve IPv6 compliance for the public site by the OMB-mandated deadline of September 30, 2012. Therefore, awarding this bridge contract acquisition any other source besides Akamai Technologies would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. And, as stated above, NRC's market research revealed no other sources besides Akamai Technologies that can satisfy NRC's requirements.</p>

For these item(s), the sum of $ * of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.<br />(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).<br />(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."<br />(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.<br />(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "Disputes."<br />(f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.<br />(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "Default." The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.<br />(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."<br />(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.<br />(j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:<br />On execution of contract $ TBD<br />(month) (day), (year) $ TBD<br />(month) (day), (year) $ TBD<br />(month) (day), (year) $ TBD<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>This requirement is sole source to the following company:<br />Quality Cryogenics of Atlanta, LLC<br />Cage 1DSR2</p>
<p>Justification for Sole Source: A new ESS chamber has been purchased. It is necessary to reduce the possibility of leakage due to manufacturing differences among multiple vendors. Quality Cryogenics installed the primary system in the 2005-2006 time range and is considered a priority vendor for modifications to the existing LN2 system. The new vacuum jacketed piping will service and connect to this primary system. The interface between the existing piping and the new piping will be made with a Bayonet connector. When connecting piping with the same vendor, the closest tolerance fits possible will improve the quality of the installation and reduce the possibility of a failure. The existing connections are made using Quality Cryogenics' proprietary bayonet connector. They must use this proprietary connector to interface with their existing piping, which is why we must use Quality Cryogenics for this work.</p>

<p>The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quotation is the most highly rated, and conforming to the solicitation, results in the best value to the Government, non-price and price factors considered. NIST reserves the right to make award to other than the lowest-priced offeror or to the offeror ranked highest technically, if it determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>The Government intends to make a single award but reserves the right to make multiple awards or make no award as a result of this RFQ.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a purchase order without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial quotation should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any and or all quotations if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest price quotation; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotation received.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of quotations, the Contracting Officer will review each to determine if the offeror followed all of the instructions in this combined synopsis/solicitation. A quotation that did not follow the instructions may be deemed unacceptable and may not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Non-price factors are listed in descending order of importance. Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The relative importance of price will increase with the degree of evaluated equality of the technical factors.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL</p>
<p>NIST will evaluate quotations, based on the information submitted in support of this factor as follows:</p>
<p>Capability:</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide information in sufficient detail to demonstrate its understanding of the requirement, providing a concise and thorough discussion of its ability to provide the required conference space and A/V equipment.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA:</p>
<p>***Capability - The Government will evaluate the offeror's ability to comply with the minimum specifications detailed in this solicitation based on the information contained in the technical volume to determine the extent of its understanding of the requirements and the likelihood that the offeror could provide a suitable conference venue and A/V equipment/labor. <br /><br />PAST PERFORMANCE/REFERENCES</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide at least three examples of past performance conducted within the last three years of contracts of relevant events, similar in type and scope to the current requirement, with federal, state or local governments and/or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance it should include a statement to that effect in its proposal. The government reserves the right to consider past performance data obtained from sources other than those provided by the offeror in its proposal.</p>
<p>The description of each reference described in this section shall not exceed a half page. For each of the contracts, the offeror shall provide the following information: <br />&bull; Contract number<br />&bull; Client's name and address<br />&bull; Dollar value<br />&bull; Period of performance<br />&bull; Narrative describing the requirement and its relevance to the current requirement<br />&bull; Name of contracting officer or point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA:</p>
<p>***Past Performance/References - the Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance information to determine first its relevance to the current requirement. Secondly, only the relevant past performance references for the past three years will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror demonstrates it has successfully fulfilled relevant contracts in the past three years, including quality of services and products and customer satisfaction. The Government will evaluate past performance by contacting the references selected at random or a specific reference identified by the offeror. The Government will assign a neutral rating to offerors with no relevant past performance in the past three years. The Government may also obtain past performance information from sources other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>PRICE</p>
<p>Price - firm, fixed-price for the required conference space, A/V equipment and labor.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA:</p>
<p>***Price - the Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed prices to determine whether the proposed prices comply with the instructions articulated above and are realistic, complete, and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements.</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>

The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only.

For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes.

<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)<br />1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79.

<p>Description of the Requirement: Overhaul prices shall include all replacement parts required by the AFTO. All replacement parts shall be new with traceability back to the OEM. In addition to the parts described in the AFTO to be replaced, a list of 100% Replacement Parts is as Attachment 1. USCG aircraft operate primarily around saltwater at low altitude and are subject to corrosion. During inspection and functional test, the presence of corrosion in any item or part thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection. Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made to the extent necessary to remove all corrosion or replace the part or parts affected. The Coast Guard does not intend to provide replacement parts as Government Furnished Material in performance of the requirement. The contractor shall be required to submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer once equipment has been received verifying the actual Part Numbers, NSN's and Serial Numbers on the equipment. The information on the equipment should mirror the information on the Purchase Order. The written notification shall identify any discrepancies between the equipment and the Purchase Order. Equipment received that indicates obvious misuse, cannibalization or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage are considered exclusions and will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Over and above work outside the direction of the AFTO that is found during performance will be handled on a case-by-case basis. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the repair directive will not be considered as "over-and-above". In the event of exclusions or over-and-above work, the contractor will be required to submit an equipment condition report to the Contracting Officer detailing the finding and a listing of the additional parts and labor necessary to return the equipment to serviceable condition. Non-re-workable items replaced during modification/overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap. Should equipment be determined Beyond Economical Repair (BER) the contractor shall provide written notification to the Contracting Officer of the BER condition and await disposition instructions. The contractor will be entitled to a separate evaluation fee and scrap charge.</p>
<p>Packaging and Marking: Packaging of the items for return shipment shall be in accordance with the contractor's best commercial practices with the following exceptions: Each item or unit must be individually packed in a separate box, carton or crate. Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with Purchase Order Number, Line Item Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, NSN, and Serial Number. The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipping, handling and storage. Preservation and protection shall be provided to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one (1) year. The USCG Aviation Logistics Center is a supply depot, therefore material will be stored and transshipped to various users. The container shall be packed and labeled suitable for shipment via land, air or sea. Packaging material shall NOT consist of popcorn material, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type or peanut packaging. Copies of packing slips shall be affixed to the outside of the shipping container.</p>
<p>The USCG does not own nor can it release the Air Force Technical Orders (AFTO) necessary to perform the equipment overhaul work. The contractor must be able to obtain the AFTO including any applicable service bulletins. All parts are Flight Critical and serial number tracked.

Offerors and any subcontractor to be used in performance of the required work shall be either OEM Certified or be an FAA Approved/Certified Repair Station. Offerors are required to submit evidence of a valid OEM Certification or FAA Certification showing authorization to affect overhaul of all parts. Expired or pending certifications are not acceptable and will render an offeror's quotation as not technically acceptable.</p>

Origin, Freight Prepaid quotes MUST include an estimate of shipping costs which will be added to the price quote for price evaluation purposes to arrive at the total cost to the Government.</p>

<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-</p>
<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or</p>
<p>(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.</p>
<p>(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:</p>
<p>(i) warrants;</p>
<p>(ii) options;</p>
<p>(iii) contracts to acquire stock;</p>
<p>(iv) convertible debt instruments; and</p>
<p>(v) others similar interests.</p>
<p>(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

 E.2  	FAR 52.209-5  CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)
 
   (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -
 
       (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -
 
         (A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
         (B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:  commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);
 
         (C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and
 
         (D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
           (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
             (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
             (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
           (2) Examples.
 
             (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
             (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
             (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
             (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
             (ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
 
     (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).
 
   THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.
 
   (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
 
   (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation.  However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility.  Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
 
   (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision.  The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
 
   (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.  If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689).  (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified  acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge  and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--

    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;

    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal  criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission
of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes  in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains  unsatisfied.

      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not  finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial  challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when  full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in  cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

      (ii) Examples. 

        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a  hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,  and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to  sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the  taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal  rights.

        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement  pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The  taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The  taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
    
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

    (1) Listed end products.

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all  service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

<DESC>Amendment No.:002 is for Solicitation No.: A12PS00396 is as follows:
1. To extend the closing date to Friday, January 27 at 12:00 p.m. Mountain Time.

2. To answer questions received.
Response to items identified in PR A12PS00396.
1.	 Factor II:  Change the term Project Engineer to Key Personnel.  Delete the requirement for a 	knowledgeable Professional Engineer and remediation.  Remainder of the paragraph.  This certifications should be for mold identification and sampling.
2.	Factor III: Reword statement to read specialized experience in rural communities for the identification of mold and speciation in human occupied spaces.
Response to Questions from Potential BidderPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) Questions:
1.	 Question 1.  Do you require that protective suits be work while sampling.  Yes.  The use of the breathable tyvek? suits is required to allow contactor to remove and dispose of the suit from house to house to prevent transporting mold spores from one unit to the other.  The occupants have been informed and this should not be a problem.
2.	Question 2.  Is so, may the suit be work from one quarters to another?  No.  A Separate suit will be required for each house/unit samples.  A total of 19 suits will be required for the project if one suit is worn per entrant/sampler.  In the event two samplers are needed per unit, each will be required to wear suits for a possible total of 38.
3.	May we us our professional judgment on site to determine if the situation requires hazardous materials procedures of if OSHA's "A Brief Guide to Mold in the Work Place" is appropriate.  Yes, but it must be documented in the final report
Suspect Bacteria Discussion:
1.	 On the second page of the solicitation, Task 2:  Mold/Bacteria Study, Paragraph A refers to "suspect bacteria," but it does not elaborate.  This item will be deleted.  Originally, the plan was to sample for bacteria but subsequent data has identified the presence of hazardous mold.  No sampling or response is required for bacteria.
Technical Capability Proposal:
1.	This will be changed to Key Personnel.  This was an error.  The requirement will be Industrial Hygienist with knowledge of impacts of mold on human health especially on susceptible populations.
Sales Tax:Arizona GRT @ 8% is an estimate intended to alert the potential that if GRT is to be paid to the State of Arizona for the work, then it should be included like the Navajo GRT of 4%.  It there will be not AZ GRT charged, then the bidder should state this no AZ Tax will be charged.
THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE OK.  EXCEPT FOR ITEM #1. SUITS MUST BE CHANGE WHEN WORK IS COMPLETED FOR EACH HOUSING UNIT.  THIS IS BEING DONE TO ASSURE THAT NO MOLD SPORES ARE CARRIED FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE.  SEE ITEM ONE ABOVE.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OFDA/OD). The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs), including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The January 2005 signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the Government of the Republic of the Sudan and the southern-based Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) officially ended more than two decades of north-south conflict during which famine, fighting, and disease killed an estimated 2 million people and displaced at least 4.5 million others. The CPA gave legitimacy to the two major parties-now sharing power in a Government of National Unity (GNU)-and contained a proviso for Southern Sudan to conduct a referendum on self-determination on January 9, 2011. The referendum in January 2011 resulted in a vote for independence. As a result, the Republic of South Sudan officially became an independent country on July 9, 2011. Between the signing of the peace agreement in 2005 and November 2010, more than two million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and 330,000 refugees returned to their communities in Southern Sudan and the Three Areas located between northern and Southern Sudan, according to the International Organization for Migration and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p>Populations continue to return from northern Sudan to the ten states of Southern Sudan and the Three Areas of Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Abyei Area. Returns have continued at a steady but slow pace since late January 2011 following the referendum, relative to the high rate between the end of October 2010 and the beginning of January. Nearly 350,000 people returned to Southern Sudan and the Three Areas between October 30, 2010 and May 31, 2011.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government (USG) remains the leading international donor to Sudan, contributing nearly $5.1 billion for humanitarian programs in Sudan and eastern Chad since FY 2004. In FY 2011, the USG continued to support the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Juba, South Sudan to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met in the ongoing response.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Juba, South Sudan, as determined in consultation with the Embassy and the Mission and subject to security and programmatic considerations. It also requires willingness to travel outside of Juba on short notice for possibly an extended period of time. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in South Sudan, as well as for disaster risk reduction programs. The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/South Sudan Mission, the US Embassy, other U.S. Agencies as appropriate, IOs, NGOs, and the UN, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA East and Central Africa Regional Office (ECARO) in Nairobi, Kenya, OFDA Washington, and USAID/South Sudan and U.S. Embassy/South Sudan, as required.</p>
<p>This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the US Embassy, other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, the Republic of South Sudan (ROSS), U.S. military representatives, as well as with relevant UN and NGOs, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.</p>
<p>Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the OFDA Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for East and Central Africa and in consultation with USAID/South Sudan, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in South Sudan for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy and other U.S Agencies, military representatives, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.<br />&bull; Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief and reintegration programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDA-funded programs in South Sudan. <br />&bull; Supervise relevant U.S. Personal Services Contractors and foreign national program staff within the Juba OFDA Program Office.<br />&bull; Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance efforts in South Sudan. Regularly review partner's reports, coordinate with OFDA/ECARO and OFDA/Sudan on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated field feedback to the partners.<br />&bull; Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:<br />o Capacity and level of activity of local institutions to carry out relief programs;<br />o Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;<br />o Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;<br />o Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;<br />o Impact of ROSS activities on humanitarian programs; <br />o Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief and reintegration programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and <br />o Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.<br />&bull; Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/Washington and OFDA/ECARO.<br />&bull; Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDA's approach to reintegration and humanitarian protection. Work closely with the PRA to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.<br />&bull; Visit OFDA-funded projects, and report on a timely basis to OFDA/Washington and OFDA/ECARO on the quality of grantees' work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions. <br />&bull; Represent USG humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.<br />&bull; Maintain regular liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, the ROSS, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.<br />&bull; Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with the OFDA/ECARO PRA and OFDA/Washington, as necessary. <br />&bull; Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as reintegration, humanitarian protection and coordination.<br />&bull; Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including monthly official reporting cables or as the situation warrants.<br />&bull; Have the ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA PRA for ECARO. However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/South Sudan, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. Embassy staff. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from the OFDA/ECARO PRA and OFDA/Washington. <br /><br />SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The OFDA PRA for ECARO will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>This is a revised Synopsis to change the procurement strategy from unrestricted to a 100% small business set-aside and to change the NAICS code.  The scope of work establishes requirements for services pertaining to the monitoring, sampling, data analysis, and data collaboration of groundwater wells at the Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) Open Burning (OB) and Open Detonation (OD) areas. Waste Military Munitions are destroyed by burning and underground detonation at the OB and OD areas. There are currently eight groundwater wells to be monitored on a semiannual basis, all of which are currently in ANAD's Hazardous Waste Facility Permit. Additional wells may also be monitored for groundwater water elevations based on the requirements of state environmental regulators. A statistical evaluation will be completed to determine if statistically significant evidence of contamination above background levels at each monitoring well exist within 45 calendar days after completion of each sampling event. If statistically significant evidence of contamination exist above background levels sampling of Appendix IX to part 264 of 40 CFR compounds will be required in addition. Annual groundwater reports are also required within this scope. This scope includes the above monitoring activities and any other groundwater activities that may result from the site's continued operation based on ANAD's Hazardous Waste Facility Permit and state/federal environmental regulations. This solicitation is for a base and four one year options. This procurement set-aside 100% for Small Business. North American Industry Classification System Code is 562910. This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501, 5.102(a)(7) and 14.205-1(c); therefore hard copies will not be provided. Proposals submitted must be in electronic format as stated in the solicitation. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ (Army Single Face to Industry). Estimated issue date is 1 February 2012. CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is, in fact, unable to maintain a bidder's mailing list. It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal non-responsive and result in the rejection of your proposal.

<DESC>This Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 10, Market Research. It is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or its Centers. The purpose of this RFI is to help the FDA understand the industry best practices, technical solutions, and sources capable of providing the full range of requirements described in this RFI. FDA will use this market research information to assess the market's capability to successfully meet FDA's Text and Data Analytics (TDA Solution) Software requirement.
<p>REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>The Government requires a comprehensive analytical tool, TDA Solution software, to assist investigators and analysts in analyzing and presenting findings of voluminous amounts of unstructured and structured evidentiary material used in investigations conducted by FDA-Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI). As described below, the TDA solution must be capable to extract entities and identify relationships with full integration of a visualization tool to present such findings. Where indicated, the TDA Solution must utilize "out of the box" functionality to accomplish tasks. Due to the sensitivity of the evidentiary material, open source plug-ins or software cannot be utilized.</p>
<p>SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:<br />Text and Data Extraction and Classification:</p>
<p>1. The TDA Solution must be able to process various Optical Character Recognition or searchable file formats such as but not limited to PDFs, Text Files, XML, Microsoft Office formats, and various email formats. The TDA Solution must have "out of the box" functionality to process the above listed formats in various languages.</p>
<p>2. The TDA Solution must have "out of the box" functionality to extract and classify text and data by entities.</p>
<p>The TDA Solution must be capable of accepting custom libraries or dictionaries as designated by FDA-OCI. Once these libraries and dictionaries are incorporated, the TDA Solution must be able to extract and classify the data. This includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceuticals, food products and additives, and medical devices.</p>
<p>Text/Data Parsing:</p>
<p>The TDA Solution must be able to parse fields containing structured data and extract and classify data by entity of the parsed fields on at least five forms designation by FDA-OCI. The data extraction from this process will be combined with extractions from unstructured data.</p>
<p>Relationship Identification:</p>
<p>The TDA Solution must be capable to use "out of the box" functionality to identify relationships between entities. This includes "out of the box" functionality to identify and tag financial relationships between entities.</p>
<p>Sentiment of Written Communication:</p>
<p>The TDA Solution must have "out of the box" capability to determine the sentiment of written statements in unstructured text. The sentiment analysis includes the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Sentiment, characteristics of the entities of the sentiment, attributes<br />&bull; Sentiment, problem expressed by the sentiment, major, minor<br />&bull; Sentiment, requests and questions associated with the sentiment, new, existing, contact<br />&bull; Sentiment, strong positive, week positive, neutral, weak negative, strong negative</p>
<p>Data Cleansing and Disambiguation:</p>
<p>The TDA Solution must include the "out of the box" functionality to determine judgments regarding disambiguation of different but similar description of entities. This includes determining that variations of a name or an address are actually one person and address, respectively. Further, the TDA Solution must be capable to standardize this data and combine into single or reduced entity identification.</p>
<p>Search and Viewer:</p>
<p>The TDA Solution must include "out of the box" functionality to search, discover, and analyze by various methods and techniques.</p>
<p>Once entities are extracted and relationships identified, the TDA Solution must be capable of pointing to the source image containing the entity or relationship. This includes a viewer that will show the results of an entity or relationship search in PDF and Text File formats. The viewer will highlight the specific location of the entity or relationship in the PDF and Text File.</p>
<p>Visualization Tool:</p>
<p>The TDA Solution must include a fully integrated visualization tool with the text and data extraction and relationship identification as described above. The vendor must present documentation to demonstrate that the tool is integrated with these attributes as part of the award. Development and integration of a visualization tool with text and data extraction and relationship identification during configuration, testing and deployment of the TDA Solution is not permitted. The visualization tool must allow for the automated extraction of identified entities and relationships into the visualization tool. This includes icons or labels to identify entities and relationships. This must also include the "out of the box" identification and labeling of financial transactions between entities. The visualization tool must allow the end user to search by entities and to crate visualization reports or graphical representations of the search results. The above described viewer will be fully integrated with the visualization tool, as it will allow the end user view the source images based on the search criteria. The visualization tool must be capable of allowing the end user to filter results in order to focus on key investigative findings. The visualization tool must also be able to demonstrate results using link analysis, graphical, statistical, and geographical charts or tables.</p>
<p>Testing, Training and Knowledge Transfer, and Technical Assistance:</p>
<p>The TDA Solution software award should include hours for government usability testing prior to production. This includes creating a testing and development environment. In addition, prior to production, the vendor must provide 80 hours of knowledge transfer to FDA-OCI or designated user on the use of the TDA Solution. Further, the vendor must provide training to at least five (5) individuals identified by FDA-OCI on the use of the TDA Solution to include the text and data extraction and relationship and visualization tool components. The vendor must provide a total of 100 hours annually of technical assistance for troubleshooting and fine-tuning of the TDA Solution software.</p>

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to issue a sole source modification to an existing contract for&nbsp;Geochemistry GIS under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The modification to this contract will add two additional one year options to the period of performance. The purpose of this contract is to&nbsp;investigate the spatial significance of specific isotope ratios and trace elements through the following: Defining stability and uniqueness of geographic variation; Quantifying seasonal variations; Quantifying variations correlated with elevation; Understanding granularity possible for mapping water sources; Determining whether surface water sources from nearby ground water sources can be distinguished clearly; Determining whether nearby or overlapping aquifers can be distinguished from each other, and exploring the use of isotope ratios and trace element compositions for various applications. This effort intends to build on results of work transitioned from another government agency.

 Projects may also require comprehensive interior design and incorporation of sustainable features. Projects (Task Orders) issued under this contract will require either single discipline or multi-discipline design services or may include 100% construction performance specifications. Projects can be based on design-build, modified design-build, or full plans and specifications format, ranging in size from $4,000,000 to $20,000,000. Task orders under or over these amounts may be considered if deemed to be in the Governments best interest and approved by the Contracting Officer. Under the FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 15 percent of the contract work with its own employees.
 The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, engineering, materials, equipment, tools, parts, supplies, and transportation to perform all of the services described in the Request for Proposal for each task order. Each task order will site a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages and the applicable Davis Bacon Wage Determination. Project Task Orders will require that schedules be managed with Primavera Suretrack (or Primavera P3). 

The procurement, if pursued, will be for one solicitation resulting in the award of approximately five separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design-Build and Construction Contracts for Northern Florida and Southern Georgia.

<DESC>Synopsis mod 01: The purpose of the synopsis mod 01 is to change the solicitation number from N61331-12-R-0004 to N61331-12-R-0010.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division, Panama City, FL (NSWC PCD), intends to award a sole-source firm fixed price contract to the Lord Corporation, 111 Lord Drive, Cary NC 27511 for upgrade to a prototype Marine Rotor Active Balancing System (MRABS) currently installed on the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hull number 91 at NSWC PCD.  Upgrades required are to the starboard balancers with better-protected cables, adding balancers to the port side of the craft, upgrade the control system to manage transient inputs and coupling between different balancers and between port and starboard systems, replacing test-type electronics control rack currently installed in the starboard cabin with a more compact control system,  providing a new maintenance and  interface panel, and material upgrades to certain components to provide better corrosion resistance in the LCAC environment.
  This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The system to be upgraded was designed, manufactured, and installed by Lord Corporation.  This company, as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is the only source with the in-depth knowledge of the MRABS design required to modify and upgrade their own system.  This is particularly true of the proprietary control system and imbedded software.  Thus Lord Corporation is the only source that can perform this requirement. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.
  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Department of Defense will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  Registration may be accomplished by accessing the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/.  NAICS 541330 applies.  Small Business Size standard $4.5M.  PSC K020.  Contract Specialist: Mrs. Kayla Nelson, Code B32, NSWC PCD, 110 Vernon Ave., Panama City, Fl 32407-7001 (850) 230-7072, FAX (850) 234-4197.

<DESC>The original synopsis posted on 01-23-12 is herein revised in its entirety and replaced with the following:



The Navy and Marine Corps Spectrum Center (NMSC) has operated with centralized spectrum management support at the national level.  Frequency Assignments are required in order to radiate radio frequencies (RF).  These are submitted in either the Standard Frequency Action Format (SFAF) or in the Government Master File (GMF) format by NMSC to the National Telecommunication Information Administration (NTIA) where they are voted on by other federal agencies belonging to the Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS).  The timely processing of proposals is critical to meeting the emerging spectrum management requirements of the DoN.
  To that end establishing spectrum support closer to the warfighter will better anticipate and meet the warfighters spectrum management requirements.  The services required will provide NMSC with essential field level technical support in the planning, acquisition, retention, protection and effective use of electromagnetic spectrum resources in support operations to the Department of the Navy.

This is a sole source action which will be a nine-month contract to Odyssey Systems Consulting Group LTD (Odyssey), in response to an effort to extend present services, while a follow-on acquisition is being processed.   Odyssey Systems Consulting Group LTD is the only firm who can supply the required services for the acquisition.
  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), and Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a).

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The new Solicitation Number is N00189-12-R-Z021.

<AWARDEE>McCrone Associates, Inc., 850 Pasquinelli Drive, Westmont, IL 60559-5539 US
<DESC>A new cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract is being awarded to acquire non-personal services for the processing and analyzing of particle samples from McCrone Associates (MA) at Westmont, IL. The decision to use the CPFF contract type is based on the use of a complex decision tree to determine how the samples will be processed and on which equipment the samples will be processed. The samples are environmental in nature and come in many forms. The instruments used include thermal ion mass spectrometer, secondary ion mass spectrometers, electron microprobes, scanning electron microscopes, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray fluorescence, just to name a few. Every NPP sample is treated independently and none of the sample analysis decision trees is routine. The decision tree process is usually performed by a group of scientists. Sample analysis can range from a bust where no particles are of interest, all the way up to a very rich sample where hundreds of instrument analyses are performed on particles of interest. The inability to accurately negotiate exact costs prior to start of work, due to the inability to determine in advance how many tests will be performed on what equipment, makes CPFF the appropriate contract type for this effort. Additional as-needed CLINs include: Equipment upgrades to be negotiated on either a firm-fixed-price (FFP) and CPFF basis, additional sample analysis and research and development (R&amp;D) to be negotiated on a CPFF basis, and travel costs based on cost reimbursement/no fee. For equipment upgrades, the nature of each effort to be added to the contract will determine whether it is negotiated as FFP or CPFF. Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), the services to be acquired are determined to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force&rsquo;s requirements. The highly specialized services to be acquired are primarily concerned with separation, manipulation, analysis, and identification of particulate matter, performed as an integral part of the government&rsquo;s nuclear test ban treaty verification. Particle analysis requires the ability to: (a) be proficient in detection, isolation, and analysis of particles; (b) perform thermal ion mass spectrometry analysis; (c) perform nondestructive screening of particles; (d) perform elemental analysis; (e) maintain all processing areas and microscope clean rooms in accordance with the current General Services Administration standards for clean room and workstation requirements and maintain class 100 clean room techniques sufficient to ensure no cross-contamination between samples; (f) describe and characterize sample particle isotope information, morphologies, elemental and molecular compositions using all available analytical techniques; (g) maintain the capability to perform isotopic and elemental analyses via scanning techniques such as microscope and scanning electron microscope; and (h) maintain capability to process and analyze samples from surge of additional collections, as required.
