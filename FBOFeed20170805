DESCRIPTION: This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government at this time. This notice is intended strictly for market research. The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to determine interest and capability of potential qualifications of Small Businesses Service Disabled Veteran-Owned firms relative to the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 333314, Optical Instruments & Lens Manufacturing.

The Department of Veteran s Affairs is seeking small business manufacturers or distributors of small business manufacturers, of functionally equivalent equipment to all the following:

          Lumenis Selecta Duet Laser Systems  

The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, supplies, materials, engineering design, and supervision to design, manufacture, and deliver this equipment. Design and delivery shall be coordinated with the Service Point of Contact Personnel, to be revealed after contract award has been determined.

PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS: 
1) Must have the minimum of the following:
Combines the YAF photodistribution cababilities with the Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) Technology into one complete unit.
SLT proven laser reduces IOP without coagulating the Trabecular Meshwork.  SLT laser can be safely repeated on patients; whereas most other laser cannot.
Lumenis SLT technology uses a Q-switched, frequency-doubled Nd:YAG; 532 nm wavelength green laser. When applied to the target tissue, the laser is selectively absorbed by melanin-containing pigmented cells in the Trabecular Meshwork, without causing thermal or coagulative collateral damage to adjacent tissue. The increase in expression of biological cytokines and cellular mediator activities following laser irradiation recruit macrophages to the Trabecular Meshwork.  In turn, macrophages remove obstructive proteins and remodel the Trabecular Meshwork, improving aqueous humor outflow and, thereby, reducing intraocular pressure (IOP).
Proprietary Advanced Laser Design automatically runs internal tests to ensure that every laser pulse meets exact power requirements, and the advanced secondary control unit guarantees the power accuracy of each laser shot. 
The unique temperature-controlled KTP crystal ensures the continuous accuracy and stability of the 532 nm (green) laser beam.  
Advance component selection, laser delivery technology and enhanced slit lamp optics provide you with consistently optimal performance from this packaged platform.
The Super Gaussian Beam Profile in YAG mode ensures the lowest energy level, allowing less optical breakdown, significantly lower risk of lens pitting to allow a more efficient tissue cutting that will enhance patient s safety and comfortability.
Storage Space
The Ergonomic Table offers true wheelchair accessibility for patients, whereas other models do not or cannot offer this feature.
The Selecta table is equipped with built-in compact storage space for lenses
or other accessories.
Ergonomic Joystick with EZGrip  Coating includes a convenient integrated laser
fire-switch.
The Selecta features 3 posterior defocus positions with an adjustable focal
point of up to 350  m posterior to the aiming beam.
The Selecta full Slit Lamp function includes a 6-step magnification changer.
The Selecta table height can be easily adjusted using its electronic up/down

<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Eunice Kennedy Shriver, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of providing delivery of ultra-pure gaseous Nitrogen (N2).<br />The delivery of ultra-pure gaseous Nitrogen (N2) is a critical requirement for many of the individual laboratories at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The loss of this resource for even a few hours imposes very large costs to experiments in the building.<br /><br />NIDDK has a requirement is for Bulk delivery of liquid nitrogen to the loading dock, and to the basement plumbing system. Users from individual laboratories use this resource for experimental work and for sample cryogenic freezing every day. Both the liquid and gaseous phases of liquid nitrogen are provided to NIDDK laboratories in Bethesda, Maryland through the large bulk delivery tanks to the loading dock (Building numbers provided at time of award). This will be Base + 4.<br /><br />Special Considerations: Loss of N2 has in the past has triggered direct damage to scientific research equipment (of several $10,000s). An even more expensive problem occurs when people undertake multi-week long unstable sample preparations so that their biochemical preparation occurs for "just-in-time" access to expensive pre-scheduled instrumentation time. To maintain 24/7 delivery to the building, this tank has to be refilled approximately once per week. It is imperative that the risk of LN2 delivery interruption to NIDDK laboratories in Bethesda, Maryland be mitigated, so the NIDDK has invested in a Telemetry Unit, which we own, that is compatible with and vendor shall, monitor our Telemetry round the clock, and it will trigger a delivery if the tank drops to 3,000 gals.<br /><br />The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 221210 with a size standard of 1000.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Eunice Kennedy Shriver, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of providing Upgrades: Existing Spinning Disk System: Dual Camera, Piezo Z, Software and Workstation.<br /><br />The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Intramural Research Program (IRP) conducts biomedical research and training related to diabetes mellitus; endocrine, bone, and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, including liver diseases and nutritional disorders; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases. Intramural research is conducted in the Institute's laboratories and clinical facilities in Bethesda, Maryland and in Phoenix, Arizona. There are currently 19 Laboratories and Branches (i.e. 19 departments with different focus areas) in the NIDDK IRP.<br /><br />Most if not all these areas of research, either occasionally or on an ongoing basis, require advanced fluorescence microscopy, including confocal microscopy, as the basis of a quantitative assay or to qualitatively complement other assays. The Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope (SDC) was originally purchased to satisfy such a need. Spinning disk confocal microscopy has been, and remains the best technology to image live cultured cells, labeled with fluorescent markers, over time. The LERB SDC thus provides a useful technology resource for other NIDDK departments outside LERB.<br /><br />Although the LERB SDC is useful to some in its current state, it requires upgrades to keep pace with technology and users' wishes for experiments. It is not nearly as sensitive nor as fast as what is currently available on the market, and several NIDDK researchers have not been able to pursue experiments that would greatly advance their studies. Because this SDC has hardware-based autofocus and the capability to turn lasers on/off within a few microseconds, whereas other SDCs in NIDDK do not have these features, it is the most cost-effective to upgrade this SDC to current technology, to answer researchers' experimental requirements.<br />All tasks need to be compatible with existing hardware and functionality of this Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope.<br /><br />Replacement of the existing CCD camera (NIH keeps the old camera) with dual 3rd-generation CMOS cameras:<br /><br />Low light sensitivity and background noise reduction at least as good as the Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 v3.<br /><br />Pixel size when using a 100x lens should be 50-80 nm in the sample space.<br /><br />Software supports simultaneous or sequential imaging with the two cameras.<br /><br />Images from the two cameras can be aligned in a few minutes by trained NIH staff after changing the dichroic between the two cameras.<br /><br />Timing of camera acquisition is synchronized with laser on/off on a sub-millisecond time scale.<br /><br />Addition of piezo stage insert to enable much faster movements in between image acquisitions during z-stacks, with sub-msec synchronization with lasers and cameras.<br /><br />The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 333314 with a size standard of 500.

<p><strong>Background:</strong> <br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.  <br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which mission it is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.<br />The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is tasked with identifying and developing novel small molecule leads against a wide spectrum of human disease targets, which it accomplishes by screening thousands of small molecules in collaboration with both intra-and extramural researchers. In pursuit of this goal, the Center has a strong internal transdisciplinary team of scientists who continually discover novel small molecules and develop novel disease models for application against a wide range of human diseases.  <br />As such, discovering probe molecules and developing human disease models that could serve as starting points for therapeutics is of great interest within NCATS. NCATS started several projects developing tissues of human disease models using 3D bioprinting technology. As a tool for validation of 3D microstructure, electron microscopy (EM) provides data in cellular and subcellular level. A Sputter Coater is one of the essential components to prepare EM. The acquisition requested here will provide insight on efficacy across many types of engineered tissues and will help progress and provide critical scientific guidance on projects that NCATS has been working on for many years.</p>

<p><strong>1.	Solicitation Number:	 HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-SBSS-2017-680</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.	Title:  Mechanical Cryogenic -150C Freezer</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.	Classification Code:  66 - Instruments and laboratory equipment</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.	NAICS Code:  334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.	Description: </strong><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong><br />The mission of The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. This request will enable NCATS and the Bioprinting group to optimize Tissue Engineering techniques by increasing capabilities, flexibility and throughput. This will ultimately increase the capability to optimize biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; and perform automated high-throughput screening (HTS) and high-content screening (HCS)<br />The Probe Development group is part of The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). The Probe Development group utilizes 3D bioprinting techniques to generate tissues which will be used to perform studies into causes and treatments of various diseases. This approach can provide data more relevant to the whole-body response than traditional studies which use two-dimensional cell cultures. Initial research is being performed to advance fabrication techniques and protocols.<br />3D bioprinting is an additive manufacturing technique to build three-dimensional live tissue structures that mimic natural in vitro live tissue. Live cells are harvested and dispensed into spatially controlled patterns in a layer by layer approach to generate three dimensional arrangements. The created structures undergo further biological treatment until they form tissue like morphology. The tissues may subsequently be used for therapeutic and research purposes.<br />As part of tissue manufacturing, large volumes of cells must be grown and cultured in a cell culture laboratory. In order to store the cells, a Cryogenic -150C Freezer is required to keep the cells viable and easily accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong> <br />Acquisition of one Mechanical Cryogenic -150C Freezer is required to enable the tissue printing group to store large quantities of cells and maintain cell viability by providing storage below the -130C glass transition temperature of water.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations<br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

<p>AA 16-05 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
