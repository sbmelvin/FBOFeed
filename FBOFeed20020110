<DESC>The Transportation Administrative Service Center (TASC), an organization within the US Department of Transportation (DOT) is seeking sources to provide urine collection for drug testing and breath alcohol testing services and supporting functions in accordance with Executive Order 12564 and the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 and any other related services to support the DOT Drug-Free Workplace Program.  In addition, similar services for certain other Federal, state, and local government agencies or entities are required under this contract.  Collection/testing is required in all 50 States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and certain locations in the Western Pacific Area.  

The estimated number of collections/tests to be performed is approximately 20,000 collections a year for drug testing and 10,000 alcohol tests with a peak in any month of approximately 2000 drug and 1000 alcohol tests.  The rate of random testing in the DOT workforce is subject to change.  The actual number of tests to be performed each year will vary depending upon such factors as random testing rate, volume of testing other than random, as well as testing that may be required to support non-DOT agencies that are customers of TASC.  Services are required on a 24-hour, 7-day a week basis.  A responsive emergency service is required.  The Contractor shall comply with any applicable Government wide standards, DOT regulations, and other related procedures, particularly in providing collectors and alcohol testing technicians qualified under 49CFR Part 40 regulations.  In addition to workload and invoicing reports, DOT may require electronic scheduling and reporting of completed work.

The testing component requires a complex scheduling, testing, monitoring, and reporting process.  The contractor shall participate with DOT in this effort by assisting, in a flexible and responsive manner, in establishing and modifying procedures required and assuring a high quality of performance.  Specific procedures may differ for TASC customers, from the procedures defined in the various DOT regulations for the drug and alcohol testing of transportation industry employees.  Also, procedures are, under certain circumstances, subject to collective bargaining of covered employees of DOT or other participating entities.  The full impact of other entities participating in this contract cannot be estimated at this time.

TASC reserves the right to include any work related to substance abuse testing, related awareness and employee/supervisor training, program design and/or advisory services which may be necessary.  This includes, but is not limited to Medical Review Officer services, alternative specimen collection/testing and alternative testing technologies.

Sources interested in this requirement should provide a description of previous experience performing contracts comparable to these services over the past three years.  The description of previous experience must include for each contract the contract number, dollar value, customer, name and telephone number of the customer point of contact, and a summary level description of the work performed.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, is not a notice of a solicitation, and does not constitute a Government agreement to contract.  Sources must indicate whether they are a small or 8(a) business under NAICS 62199.  The Government does not intend to pay for information furnished in response hereto.  Responses (an original and one (1) copy) are required by 5:00 pm on January 18, 2002 to the attention of Deborah Rincon, US Department of Transportation/TASC, 400 7th Street, SW, Room 5106, Washington, DC 20590.  NOTE hand-carried responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory is in need of a modern power drive system for two existing DC Dynamometers.  Heavy duty test cells #3 and #4 are equipped with GE 380hp electric double ended reversing dynamometers.  A motor-generator set and original GE controls power the dynamometers.  The dynamometer systems were installed in the 1970's.  The scope of activity in this procurement is to replace the motor generators and GE controls with modern Digital DC Drives and a manual dynamometer controller. Heavy Duty Test Cells #3 and #4 are Engine Dynamometer Test Cells.  The test cells are designed to run steady state exhaust emission tests on methanol, gasoline and diesel engines.  The engines are used on research projects for the Advanced Technology Division and typically have rated power value range of 0 to 380hp.  The engines are directly coupled to the dynamometer with a vibration dampening drive shaft.  The testing consists of steady state mode operation.  During the steady mode testing, the exhaust emissions can be sampled and measured along with many other parameters including actual engine power output.  Finally, emission rates are calculated to yield brake specific results or according to US Federal Standards (40 CFR 86) and standards from other international governing bodies. The contractor will provide for electrical disconnection of all old equipment, installation of new equipment, connection of new equipment to power grid and dynamometer, drive commissioning, and training of EPA personnel.  The procurement is for a drive system and a manual dynamometer controller it makes no further requirement of integrating the drive/controller/dynamometer system will be a stand alone unit.  The EPA will provide the necessary utilities, with proper capacity, to the site.  Interested parties should submit a written request to receive the Statement of Work and RFQ (SF-1449) to Scott Tharp at the above address by Fax (513) 487-2107 or by E-mail Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Quotations are to be submitted on SF-1449 by 3:00 p.m. January 18, 2002.

<DESC>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) intends to negotiate with Battelle Memorial Institute under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-2 for tribological wear testing services to characterize the effectiveness of lubricating grease on bronze/steel couples in reciprocating, sliding wear motion.  Specifically, a series of ASTM standard Block-on-Ring tests (ASTM D-3704) incorporating variations in pressure load, lubricant type, and foreign contaminant fluids is required. In response to this notice the contractor must be experienced in the specific ASTM test procedure utilizing ASTM standard wear test apparatus.  The contractor will be under the technical direction of an NTSB-designated Principal Investigator. The NTSB?s test plan (to be provided) calls for about 60 tests, each requiring about one working day.  The tests must be conducted in accordance with the test plan, which specifies the test protocol, test matrix, data acquisition requirements, analysis requirements, documentation, and reporting.  The NTSB will provide test specimens (steel rings and bronze blocks), lubricants, and contaminant fluids.   Electronic versions of test data shall be provided to NTSB and its designated Principal Investigator following each test, throughout the duration of the program.  A final report documenting test procedures, test conditions, pertinent tribological data reduced to engineering units, analysis, and conclusions shall be provided within 30 days of the completion of testing. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 10 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the NTSB.  A determination by NTSB not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of NTSB.  Information received will normally be considered soley for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note. (22)

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Engineer District, New Orleans, has a requirement for the removal and disposal of asbestos-containing materials.  The first phase of the work to be performed under this contract consists of removing and satisfactorily disposing of approximate ly 2700 square feet of asbestos ceiling panels from the three rooms of the Old River Control Structure shop building, located in Concordia Parish, LA.  According to a test performed on 4 February 2000 by EMSL Analytical, Inc. of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, usi ng polarized light microscopy, the material is believed to be 45% chrysotile asbestos and 55% other non-fibrous materials.  This determination was made from a single sample, and may not be representative of all of the material to be removed.  It shall be t he responsibility of the Contractor to confirm the results of this test prior to performing abatement work.  The Government anticipates that the abatement work will be performed under Class II protocols, but again it shall be the responsibility of the Cont ractor to confirm this assessment and to take all appropriate contractual, regulatory, and protective actions required to perform the safe removal of the asbestos-containing material, regardless of the abatement protocols actually required.  Most ceiling p anels are presently intact, but there are some damaged panels.  The second phase of the work consists of furnishing and installing approximately 2700 square feet of 3/8-inch plywood panels to replace the asbestos panels, including painting of the plywood.  The second phase cannot be performed until all work is completed for the first phase.  Solicitation No. DACW29-02-T-0042 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation is unrestricted.

<DESC>:  The National Wildlife Health Center (BRD), Madison, WI, U.S. Geological Survey intends to award a non-competitive purchase order to BIOLOG, Hayward, CA for a microstation system which is compatible with the current systems in use in the laboratory.  The procurement of the Biolog Microstation System is an enhancement of the identification systems employed by the laboratory since 1997.  The Biolog Microstation System consists of a semi-automated reader connected to the databases to provide enhanced Biolog use and reduce operator errors.  No other commercially available system can be used to enhance the current system in use.  The system is capable of identifying over 1,900 species of aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, yeast, and filamentous fungi.  Especially critical is the system's database for Aeromonas, Vibrio, and filamentous fungi.  The Filamentous Fungi Database contains the identification patterns for over 500 taxa from over 120 genera.  This database can only be used with an automatic system.  No other commercially available system is capable of the identifications needed to be supplied by this system.  The system must provide bacterial and fungal identifications based on metabolic utilization patterns rather than biochemical reactions.  This unique feature complements the other systems currently used in the laboratory that use the biochemical reactions methods for identification.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must be submitted via e-mail to: mfritts@usgs.gov by 01/14/02.  No additional synopsis will be published.   Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) Contracts and Controls Review Department (CCRD) has a requirement for professional audit services in support its Premium Compliance program. It is anticipated that the PBGC may award one or more contracts on a labor-hour basis in support of this program. There is an estimated 9,225 hours of effort to be performed in the base year and similar quantities in each of four option years. The primary objective of the Premium Compliance program is to assess compliance with PBGC premium regulations and filing requirements. Reports issued by contractors will provide input as to whether plan sponsors have paid PBGC the appropriate amount of premiums and met other filing requirements. In doing so, the contractor will be responsible for complying with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Government Auditing Standards as they relate to application of agreed-upon procedures and examinations, as appropriate.  As PBGC has the burden of proving that plan sponsors did not pay the appropriate amount of premiums and the work of the contractor may be subject to review in court proceedings, it is critical that all work be performed in accordance with the referenced auditing standards. Firms interested in this requirement may view additional information regarding the PBGC at its web site: www.pbgc.gov. The solicitation will be made available through the FedBizOps.gov web site. The estimated release date of the solicitation is February 8, 2002. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration by the agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

Step-One, Request For Technical Proposal (RFTP) will be due approximately February 25, 2002.  Offerors should submit technical proposals that are complete and acceptable without the need for additional explanation or information as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as originally submitted.  The Government may proceed with Step-Two (Invitation for Bid) of the process without requesting further information from any offeror.  However, the Government reserves the right to request additional information from offerors on technical proposals that could reasonably be made acceptable.  At the conclusion of the technical evaluation (Step-One), only the most highly qualified firms in accordance with the evaluation criteria, will be eligible to participate in Step-Two of this process.  Offerors will be notified of a pre-proposal/site visit conference in the RFTP documents.  Attendance at the conference by firms wishing to participate in Step-One of the process is highly encouraged.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be in writing and addressed to judi.m.jzyk@noaa.gov.   Step-Two involves the submission of sealed "priced" bids.  An Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued only to those firms that were determined to be most highly qualified under Step-One procedures.  Each bid received in Step-Two must be based on the offeror's own technical proposal as submitted under Step-One procedures.  A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH has a requirement to award several contracts to address the threat of emerging viral and prion diseases. 

The use of interactive research units focused on a specific need has proven to be a successful model that serves as both a responsive infrastructure capable of rapidly implementing new activities and a mechanism to provide cross-fertilization of ideas. The Request for Proposals (RFP) is being designed around this model to support interactive research on emerging viral diseases. 

NIAID intends to establish several multi-disciplinary research units/contracts to develop and evaluate the scientific information and tools needed by the Government to control emerging viral and viral-like diseases. The units will conduct collaborative, interactive, interdisciplinary research. The units must be capable of quick response to threats posed by emerging diseases. Two or more units will provide the capability to address scientific questions arising from the emergence of viral pathogens, such as the flaviviruses West Nile and Dengue. In addition one or more units will focus on the emergence of viral-like prion agents typified by those associated with infectious neurologic diseases such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in both humans and animals. 

Those units dealing with conventional viruses must develop and maintain the capacity to quickly study new threats from emerging viruses and provide needed information in the areas of general virology, viral immunology, viral pathogenesis, and epidemiology of these agents. These units must demonstrate the ability to perform field studies to define the natural cycling of the virus in the environment. They should include experts in the study of arthropod-borne vectors and enzootic amplifying hosts. The capability to work on these agents will be demonstrated by establishing and maintaining a successful research program providing needed scientific information on viruses that have already emerged, particularly flaviviruses such as Dengue and West Nile viruses. An additional capacity to be developed by these units is the ability to analyze new, environmentally sound vector control tools and other strategies needed to intervene in the emergence and spread of arthropod-borne infectious diseases.

One or more units will focus on unconventional viral-like agents, primarily prions associated with infectious neurologic diseases such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in both humans and animals. Laboratory studies show that there is a strong barrier to inter-species infection by TSE-associated prions. Nevertheless, the actual risk to humans posed by TSE-affected cattle or other animals remains unknown. In the U.S., there have been no documented cases of TSE in cattle, but other prion diseases are endemic in several western states. These units will determine factors effecting intra-species transmission of TSEs to humans and potential interventions for prevention or treatment of disease.

In the event of a public health threat, each unit will be required to respond by re-direction of its program. Therefore, it is envisioned that these units will implement, staff and maintain coordinated groups that can provide information needed to enhance the U.S. capacity to better predict, prevent, treat and control emerging viral diseases.

Studies envisioned include key elements of: the natural history and epidemiology of the agent, its replication and evolution, and its pathogenesis in animal and human hosts. This information would be used to develop and test prediction, prevention and control strategies utilizing newly developed public health tools such as vaccines and antiviral therapeutics.

<DESC>The Parasitology and International Programs Branch (PIPB), Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), intends to negotiate the renewal of two on-going contracts that provide support as Helminth Reagent Resources Centers.  One contract is with Biomedical Research Institute for The Maintenance and Supply of Schistosome Infected Snails and Mammals and the second is with the University of Georgia for The Filariasis Repository Research Service. The objective of the Institute, under this 7-year renewal, is to continue to maintain and supply (to pre-approved U.S. and overseas requestors) filarial or schistosomal resources.  These supply projects include the maintenance of parasites, intermediate vector hosts, and mammalian hosts of either filariasis or schistosomiasis. Both contracts have been in existence for over 30 years and represent the only source of these materials.  They have continued to provide reliable sources of filarial and schistosomal parasites, vectors and host mammals to the helminth research community.  The filarial resource center filled approximately 180 requests in the latter half of 2001.  The schistosome resource center filled 133 requests, as well as many standing orders which do not require separate request forms for each order.  These contractors will continue to provide supplies, training and applicable protocols, when requested, for utilization of the supplied materials.  CURRENT SUPPORT includes:  1) maintenance of life cycles of selected confirmed species of filarial or schistosome parasites; 2) maintenance of intermediate host vectors of each parasite: vectors of filarial parasites are mosquitoes of specific species; vectors of schistosome parasites are snails of specific species; 3) maintenance of mammalian host animals of filarial and schistosome parasites:  filarial parasite hosts include jirds, mice, dogs and cats; schistosome hosts are specific species of mice (AALAC accreditation is required for the maintenance of mammalian hosts of either parasite; 4) inventorying of parasite, intermediate and mammalian hosts organisms; and 5) shipping, according to specific standards established and approved by OHRP, or parasites, vector and mammalian host animals to requestors, both in the U.S. and overseas. EXPANDED SUPPORT will include:  1) computer-based inventorying of parasites, vectors, and mammalian hosts; 2) establishment of a contract Website (for each resource) providing registration/indemnification information, a complete listing of available parasites, vectors and mammals, standard operating procedures (SOPs) for use/maintenance of resource materials, and online training materials available to requestors; 3) provision of on-site training in the culture and/or use of resource materials (at either the requestor's or contractor's site); 4) storage and inventorying of genomic/genetic materials produced by researchers and sent to the resource services for distribution to requestors: genomic materials may include clones, probes, specific gene segments, etc.; 5) provision of support for collaborative interactions to expedite the application of molecular biological/genomic technology to the study of these two parasites.  AUTHORITY:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and HHSAR 306.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Inherent duplication of cost to the government and difficulty and high costs of starting a new repository make competition unfeasible for this project.  If, however, there are responsible Sources who feel that there are extenuations that would enable them to perform the requirement, they must respond within 45 days from the posting date of this announcement.  See Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. 
The following Request for Information (RFI) is issued for purposes
of conducting market research and encouraging commercial companies to provide information concerning current industry practices. Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) Infantry Weapons Product Group is formulating acquisition and life cycle support strategies for flash hiders for weapons of .50 caliber and less. These devices should be compatible with current weapon systems, in particular the M16A2, M249, M240G, and M2.  The flash hider should significantly reduce current flash signature, making the discharge of the weapon as close to invisible as possible to both the naked eye and third generation night vision devices.  Installation of the flash hider should be able to be accomplished by the operator or 2nd echelon maintenance facility.  MARCORSYSCOM is seeking candidate systems which do not require additional special tools.  The device should not significantly affect the shot dispersion, trajectory of the round, zero of the weapon, or cycle of the weapon.  These systems will be operational and maintainable in all types of climates and terrain where Marines deploy, specifically in arid, tropical, temperate, and arctic climates, as well as amphibious operations. Background information: The Marine Corps is looking for available COTS systems to fulfill these requirements, potentially acquiring several thousand systems of each caliber.  Industry firms capable of rapidly accomplishing the required services, in whole or in part, are invited to submit a response to this notice.  Firms should identify/submit a copy of their GSA schedule.  Firms should also include literature, brochures, price lists, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.   Interested firms are requested to respond NLT 25 January 2002, stating their business size, NAICS Code, and identifying a corporate point of contact. Interested sources should respond to: (U. S. Mail address) Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN CT-JC, 2033 Barnett Ave., Suite 315, Quantico, VA 22134-5010. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.

<CONTACT>Felicia Rodriguez, Contract Specialist, (805) 228-8701.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division (NSWCPHD), Port Hueneme, CA, Code 4G60 is seeking sources to develop and produce a solid-state high voltage RADAR modulator.  The solid-state modulator will be a retrofit replacement for an existing vacuum tube-based modulator installed in U.S. Navy surface RADAR transmitters on board U.S. Navy combatant ships.  The new modulator will be required to create a high voltage pulse (greater than 10KV) using solid-state components such as but not limited to IGBTs, MOSFETS, FETs to perform the high voltage switch function.  The new modulator will provide the high voltage pulse to a TWT operating in anode pulsed configuration.  The new modulator will also provide the TWT with a negative cathode potential adjustable from -9.5KVDC to -12.5KVDC (non-pulsing) and a high voltage grid anode pulse from the baseline cathode negative voltage  (TWT OFF) to 0 volts (TWT ON) at 2 amps max.  The new modulator will also provide a dual-mode DC filament voltage adjustable from 5.2 to 6.2 volts. The modulator design must contain Lowest Replaceable Units (LRUs) that can be easily replaced by shipboard technicians using standard hand tools.  Replacement of LRUs must not require the use of any special tools, special test equipment, soldering, or special training.  Voltages available to power the new modulator are 115VAC 400HZ 3 phase delta at 20 amps and 115VAC 400HZ single phase at 2 amps.  NSWCPHD anticipates procuring one prototype modulator plus one first article modulator.  If the prototype and first article are successful, NSWCPHD anticipates procuring up to 32 production modulators.  This announcement is not a request for proposal, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information or items submitted in response  to this announcement.  It is anticipated that a solicitation for contract award will be issued in the summer of FY02.  Parties capable of developing and producing the modulators should respond in writing no later than 25 January 2002.  Responses should include company information regarding the development and production of similar or like high voltage switching devices.  Each response should reference the subject of this sources sought announcement.  Submit responses to Gaylin Humphreys, PHDNSWC Code 4G61, Tel (805) 228-7655, Fax (805) 228-7637, or Email: HumphreysGL@phdnswc.navy.mil

<SUBJECT>R -- Students.gov Online Survey
<DESC>Project Background:  Students.gov, the SFA-sponsored government-wide web portal for students, was launched in April 1999. Since its debut, the site has been enthusiastically received and its usefulness confirmed through awards and praise from the secondary, postsecondary and cyber communities. 

More than a million visitors have visited the site since its launch over two years ago, beginning with 2,400 visitors in its first full month of operations to more than 68,000 visitors in November 2001. The students.gov web team has completed two major site redesigns in response to feedback from student focus groups and email feedback received through the site.  The site is fully accessible and compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

Recognized both within and outside of government, students.gov serves as a model for customer-centered government web portals. James Vaughan of AOL's GovernmentGuide, speaking at the Department of Labor in May 2001, cited students.gov as an outstanding customer-centric website and stated, "This is what most government websites should be like." 

Students.gov received the Hammer Award in March 2000 and the E-Gov 2000 Trailblazer Award in May 2000; was featured in articles in FirstGov's "e-Gov News" in May 2001 and GSA's "Intergovernmental Solutions" in July 2001; was featured in the Scout Report (an influential website review newsletter directed at educators and librarians) in November 2000; received an "A+" rating from EducationWorld. Students.gov is prominently featured in AOL, Google, Yahoo, and many other commercial portals and search engines.

Objective:  SFA wishes to create a website user survey to measure customer satisfaction and comments about the students.gov web portal and to determine which groups (e.g. students, families, educators, college officials, etc) are using students.gov and for what purpose.  Subject to OMB approval, the survey will be posted on students.gov for a limited period of time, and website visitors will have the option to complete it, but not be required to do so.  The survey should take no more than 5 to 10 minutes to complete.  No names, addresses, Social Security numbers, or other personally identifiable information will be collected ? only user feedback about the site and general demographic information that cannot be connected to any individual.

The survey results will be used to complement students.gov?s customer focus groups and usability study findings.  At the end of the survey period, the survey results will be compiled and analyzed, and used to improve students.gov by making it more usable and relevant to those who are using it most.

Tasks:  Develop a survey that measures customer satisfaction with the services, information, and usability of the students.gov website, identifies some general demographic information about website visitors (not personally identifiable or linked to individuals), and determines the purposes for which those visitors are coming to the site.  

Assist with the forms and process of obtaining OMB clearance for a limited online survey.

At the end of the survey period, compile and analyze the survey results. 

Prepare a written report presenting the findings and conclusions resulting from the survey, including recommendations for site enhancements or design changes.

Assumptions:  SFA will post the survey on the site, create a banner to solicit survey responses, and provide the resulting survey data to the contractor.

Project Benefits:  Surveying website visitors about their satisfaction with students.gov will provide valuable information that will be used to improve the usability and relevance of the site to those who use it.

Expert advice in creating the survey and analyzing survey results will provide SFA with better insight and understanding of the value of students.gov.

Evaluation Criteria:  Familiarity with web portals, especially federal web portals -- 20 points; Understanding/experienc
