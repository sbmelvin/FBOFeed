<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Knowtis Design, Inc. in an effort to raise public awareness about the services and programs of the NLM.  Knowtis Design will 1) produce 2500 MEDLINEPlus physicians outreach kits 2) produce mailing labels and prescription pads 3) produce Lucite Stand to hold materials.  After meeting with numerous design firms and other potential contractors, NLM has determined that Knowtis design is the only vendor that could meet NLM's needs.  Knowtis Design is uniquely qualified to assist NLM in its design needs based on their current NIH experience with the NLM and other institutes.  They have an understanding of the NIH and NLM structure, health and science content, science and biomedical research involved and the audiences that the NLM needs to reach.  Additionally, Knowtis Designs has been responsible for successfully developing the many NLM outreach projects, and was also responsible for creating the NLM Capabilities Brochures.  Another vendor would require a considerable amount of time to reach a similar level of understanding that would limit our ability to produce these deliverables highlighting the products and services of NLM with regards to MEDLINEPlus in a timely fashion. Our goal is to reach the targeted physician's market and their patients by October 31, 2002.  This period of performance is a critical element and must be mid-October, 2002.  This service will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations ( RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm's ability to meet the government's requirements.  Responses are required within 7 (seven) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 02-244 shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Michael G. Kapsilis, Contract Specialist (301) 496 6546 kapsilm@mail.nlm.nih.gov or Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, (301) 496 6545.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This requirement is being conducted in conjunction with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and is follow-up to the DIA pre-solicitation conference notice posted on September 4, 2002 (Reference No. VACA09-01). All interested parties should refer to this notice for details with regard to the conference.  The Department of the Interior, GovWorks as an acquisition agent for the DIA, intends to competitively award a contract for DIA's workforce planning initiative. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Solicitation Number is 1435-04-02-RP-87324. The solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).   STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES - 1.0 OVERVIEW: Of the -four thrusts- that have been instituted by the Director, DIA to address issues central to the defense intelligence community, none is more broad, complex, emotionally charged, or open to widely varying interpretation than the Workforce Thrust.  Also, none is more vital to our overall modernization effort.  Skilled people will continue to be the common denominator of successful intelligence support, regardless of the customer or mission.  The Workforce Thrust effort is chartered with two explicit tasks: A. Craft a Workforce to Meet Future Challenges, and B. Improve Proficiency and Efficiency.  Overarching these basic tasks is a stated intent to transform DIA into a modern knowledge-based organization. This statement of intent is extremely relevant to Joint Vision 2010 or even 2020 workforce issues.  Among the most significant challenges our future workforce must meet is that of ensuring Decision-making Superiority in an environment where an enormous stream of information is pervasively and rapidly available to all parties.  Velocity and value, rather than exclusivity, will more often define superiority in this realm.  That is, while access to secrets -exclusive information- will not diminish in importance, the rapid addition of value - transforming data into knowledge or rendering it actionable - to information of all types will gain exponentially in importance.  In instances where access to information is universal, the side that most rapidly and precisely moves it, interprets it, and acts on it wins.  2.0 WORKFORCE PLANNING SCOPE: The overarching intent of this program is to identify the necessary DIA skill mix and balance to meet future mission requirements and transform DIA into a modern knowledge-based organization.  More specifically, the Government's intent is to: A. Capture details of current workforce, B. Project future workforce requirements, and C. Establish a force structure transition plan.  3.0 PARTNERING PHILOSOPHY: A major intent of this SOO is to create a partnership between DIA and the contractor.  DIA intends to structure the contract in a manner that ensures that the contractor's goals and objectives are in alignment with those of the agency.  DIA does not use the term partner and partnership as legal terms.  The DIA/contractor relationship will reflect the attributes of an open, collaborative, and customer-oriented professional relationship.  In addition to meeting program objectives, the contractor is encouraged to: A. Consistently take steps to understand DIA's crucial business issues and opportunities, B. Ensure its services deliver tangible and meaningful business benefits, C. Work collaboratively with other contractors, government agencies, and business partners to ensure project success, and d. Resolve the complexities and difficulties that are characteristic of recruiting, retaining, and managing mission-critical human capital.  4.0 WORKFORCE PLANNING OBJECTIVES:  A.  Identify the workforce skill mix and balance needed to meet mission requirements and achieve DIA strategic objectives now and in the future, (i). Prioritize current and future DIA mission requirements, (ii).  Inventory current and future workforce skills and mix (civilian/military/contractor) necessary to meet mission requirements, B. Bridge current capability to future need. C. Revitalize and reshape the DIA workforce to: (i). improve DIA proficiency and efficiency in meeting DIA strategic objectives, by (1) Achieving a more flexible and adaptive organization and workforce that accommodates change, (2) Determining the proper future workforce size, mix and balance, and (3) Improving employee recruitment, cross-training, and fungible skills; D. Develop a system to measure and forecast DIA's workforce requirements in support of DIA strategic objectives.  5.0 DIA STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES: A partnership of highly skilled people and leading-edge technologies providing war-fighters, policymakers, and planners with assured access to required intelligence.  ACQUISITION STRATEGY - The Government anticipates awarding one or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with subsequent Time and Materials or Fixed Priced Delivery Orders.  It is estimated that any contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation will be for a period of 1 base year with for 4 option years. HOW TO RESPOND: GovWorks will conduct this acquisition utilizing a multi-phased approach. The initial Phase will consist of the pre-solicitation conference followed by submission of capability statements by the interested parties.  An interested party must demonstrate that your organization is qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement detailing 1. key staff that will work on the contract (those contractor employees that will have primary responsibility for performing and managing the work,) 2. organizational experience and facilities, and 3. past performance (specific references for similar work that your firm has successfully performed within the past 12-18 months, including number, size, and complexity of similar projects), adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered products.  Include contract number or reference title, project name or description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with a point of contact and phone number that is current.  All references will be checked.  If references can't be contacted, then the information is of no value.  An original plus five (5) copies of the Capability Statement are due October 1, 2002, by 4 PM ET to Procurement Operations, Mail Stop 2510, Second Floor, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA, 20170.  If delivery is made in person or by courier, the building has a security check in at the rear of the building, which may delay timely receipt of proposals.  Allow extra time for security check in when hand delivering documents.  An electronic copy of the Capability Statement may be sent by email to James.MacKay@mms.gov.  A FAX copy of Capability Statement will not be accepted.  Following the evaluation of the Capability Statements, only firms demonstrating the best experience, organizational capability and assigned key personnel to complete the work will be invited to continue on with Phase 2, which will be in the form of Technical and Cost proposals.  After Phase 2, the Government anticipates entering into a Due Diligence Process (Phase 3) with only those offerors deemed most likely to receive a contract award. FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS - The Technical Proposal will be primarily in the form of an oral presentation, followed by a question and answer (Q&A) period as described below.  Those Offerors deemed by the Government to be capable and qualified to perform this type of effort, based on a review of the Qualification Statements, will be invited to give oral presentations.  While the Technical Proposal is mainly an oral presentation, there is a written portion.  The written portion consists of a summary of the oral presentation that is to be given, a proposed Performance Work Statement which will become part of any resultant contract, and a Program Management Plan (discussed below).  The Government will establish each Offeror's presentation time and date by lottery and will inform each Offeror by telephone or FAX.  Please provide the name of the person to be notified along with the telephone and/or fax number.   ORAL PRESENTATION CONSTRAINTS - Only the Offeror's key project personnel will be allowed to participate in the oral presentation. Key project personnel includes only those persons who will be assigned to the contract.  Two additional people (i.e. chief executive officer, company president, legal representative, etc.) may attend, but will not be allowed to present at the oral presentation except in a brief company introduction that will not be evaluated.  It is anticipated that the key project personnel will answer the majority of the questions posed during the Q&A discussion session.  The two additional representatives may address any appropriate questions that arise during the discussion.  The time allowed for each Offeror's presentation may not exceed one hour in length.  Upon completion of the presentation, the Government will caucus for up to one hour to discuss the Offeror's presentation and to formulate questions.  The Government will ask these questions to the Offeror directly after the caucus during the Q&A discussion session.  The Q&A discussion session will last approximately one hour.   ORAL PRESENTATION TOPICS - During the oral presentation the Offeror's key project personnel should expound on the following topics: (1) Discussion of the Offeror's understanding of the background, objectives and work requirements of the Statement of Work, (2) Discussion of proposed staffing, personnel qualifications, management, methods and techniques for completing each task, (3) Discussion which supports how each task will be evaluated for full performance and acceptability of work from the Offeror's viewpoint, (4) Discussion of anticipated major difficulties and problem areas, along with potential recommended approaches for their resolution, and (5) Discussion on any perceived major logistical considerations.  Key project personnel may also address any other topics considered to be pertinent to a demonstration of the team's knowledge, competence, and capability to perform this effort as long as the all information is presented within the one hour time limit. The oral presentation should reflect the Offeror's reasoning and approach to solving the objectives of this project.  The Government will assess the Offeror's knowledge and understanding of the required tasks.  WRITTEN PRESENTATION SUMMARY AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT PLAN - As stated above, you must submit a written summary of your oral presentation as described in (1) through (5) of Oral Presentation Topics.  The written summary should explain the subjects addressed during the presentation and not exceed ten pages in length.  Use bullets to highlight items and keep it concise and to the point.  We do not want an elaborate written discussion of your oral presentation.  Any documentation in excess of the ten (10) page limit will not be evaluated.  In addition to the summary, a Program Management Plan is required from each Offeror.  The Program Management Plan shall be simple, easy to read, and shall clearly and concisely describe project responsibilities and personnel, any proposed subcontracting arrangements, communication and coordination, scheduling of all tasks and subtasks, meetings, and deliverables.  All staff needed to conduct the work and produce all required products and deliverables must be identified.   A program scheduling plan portraying critical areas of effort, significant milestones, and the schedule for completion of each milestone, shall be provided.  FORMAT FOR PRICE/COST PROPOSAL - Your cost proposal shall be a separate volume from the written portion of your technical proposal.  It shall be submitted in an original and five (5) copies at the same time as the written portion of your technical proposal.  The due date for submission of both Technical and Price/Cost Proposals is October 22, 2002 East Coast time 4:00 P.M.  Electronic submittals are acceptable.  Your cost proposal shall clearly indicate the proposed labor categories, hours and rates for this effort.  ASSUMPTIONS, CONDITIONS, OR EXCEPTIONS - Offerors must submit, under separate cover, all (if any) assumptions, conditions, or exceptions with any of the terms and conditions of this statement of work.  If not noted in this section of your proposal, it will be assumed that the offeror proposes no assumptions for award, and agrees to comply with all of the terms and conditions as set forth herein.  It is not the responsibility of the Government to seek out and identify assumptions, conditions, or exceptions buried within the offeror's proposal.  Oral Presentations are expected to take place the week of October 28, 2002.  PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA - Each Offeror's proposal is evaluated according to the factors shown below. While the price/cost factor will be an important part of the selection decision, non-price/cost evaluation factors are significantly more important than the price/cost factor.  However, price/cost will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical factors approach equal. Factor A, B and C are roughly equal to each other; factor D is slightly less important.  Sub-factors listed under each factor are of equal importance to each other.  A. Technical Approach - 1.  Understanding of the work, including creativity and thoroughness shown in planned execution of the project; 2. Discussion of specific methods and techniques for completing each discrete task including the comprehensive performance work statement and contract work breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet program and mission requirements set forth in the SOO; 3. The degree to which the technical approach clearly demonstrates how implementation of proposed solutions will improve delivery of timely, cogent intelligence to warfighters, policymakers, and weapons systems designers;  4.  Anticipation of potential problem areas, and creativity and feasibility of solutions to problems; 5.  Discussion of logistics, schedule, and any other issues the Government should be aware of; 6.  Quality of the Program Management Plan and allocation of personnel and resources. B. Past Performance - 1.  The organization's history of successful completion of projects; history of producing high-quality reports and other deliverables; history of staying on schedule and within budget; 2. The quality of cooperation (with each other) of key individuals within your organization, and quality of cooperation between your organization and its clients. C. Key Personnel Qualifications - 1.  The currency, quality and depth of experience of individual personnel in working on similar projects. A similar project is meant to convey similarity in topic, dollar value, duration, and complexity; 2.  Quality and depth of education; experience on other projects which may not be similar enough to include in response to C.1. (immediately above) but may be relevant; and publication history; D. Organizational Experience/Contractor's Capability - 1.  The degree of comparability of past projects to the current project, including number of projects, complexity, and dollar amount.  Supporting subcontractors, consultants and partners will be considered; 2. Appropriate mix and balance of education and training of team members; 3. Capability to handle Top Secret/SCI material; E. Price/Cost.  CONTRACT AWARD - Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFP, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between proposals that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror. Questions should be sent via fax or Email as soon as possible to:  <mailto:James.MacKay@mms.gov> James.MacKay@mms.gov. Please include with your question(s) your full name, the RFP number & title, your organization, complete address with telephone and fax numbers.  Telephonic questions or requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration Logistics Center (FAALC) intends to award a contract to the University of Oklahoma (OU) School of Industrial Engineering (IE).  This consulting services requirement will be processed under single source procedures to assist the FAALC for the purposes of designing restock locations for Stockroom G in the Logistics Support Facility (LSF), Oklahoma City OK using a popularity-based storage.  The contract will be a firm-fixed price contract, and has an estimated value of $27,000.00.   <P> This follow-on contracted action to the University of Oklahoma will be a continuation of the re-design of the Logistics Support Facility (LSF) material flows and layout in stages using an analytic stocking optimization model known as Flow Planner. This sub-contractor proprietary model was developed with the University’s input, and was purchased by the FAA to provide a means to maintain the slotting design in the future (this model is required for this requirement since it is the basis of the FAA’s stocking configurations).  Therefore, it has been determined it would be cost and time prohibitive for a new contractor to attain the level of understanding and support that will be required under this contract.  The final analysis to single source with OU is based upon the need to maintain the continuity, and integrity for the specified services.   <P> This announcement expires on 09/18/2002 at 5:00 CDT, and is for informational purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<SOLNBR>RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BAA-03-41

<CONTACT>Paul McFarlane, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-0349, Fax 301-402-0972, Email pm24v@nih.gov - Paul McFarlane, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-0349, Fax 301-402-0972, Email pm24v@nih.gov
<DESC>The Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT), at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) promotes and supports a broad range of research projects on basic mechanisms of immune function, including studies of innate immunity and the immunological basis of vaccines and adjuvants. The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) ?Innate Immune Receptors and Adjuvant Discovery? is to solicit proposals for a research program beginning at the discovery/molecular response evaluation stage and progressing to preclinical testing of new adjuvants based upon triggering of the human innate immune system.  For the purpose of this BAA, adjuvants are defined as molecules that act via innate immune system signaling to activate desired innate and adaptive (T-cell and antibody-mediated) immune responses.  The adjuvant products aimed for in this program may encompass uses both as vaccine adjuvants, to elicit T- and B cell responses when co-administered with an immunogen, as well as stand-alone immunomodulators to stimulate short term protective responses against broad categories of infectious agents. Research must be directed toward vaccine adjuvants and immune stimulation strategies to defend against NIAID categories A, B, or C agents. These pathogens are listed at the website: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/bioterrorism/bandc_priority.htm.  

The following research areas will be part of this requirement: (1.a.) High throughput analytical approaches to identify and characterize innate immune receptors and/or their ligands. This includes use of existing techniques or the development of improved methods including genomic and proteomic approaches to identify receptors and/or their ligands, as well as structure-activity relationship studies (SAR) of innate immune receptor-ligand interactions.  Ligands may include both direct and indirect triggers of the receptors. (1.b.) Analyses and evaluation of cellular responses activated by innate receptors/ligands.  The overall goal of this research area is to understand the direct and indirect effects of receptor-mediated activation in order to focus on desired responses for lead development. (2) Lead compound identification and improvement based upon mechanism of action; and, (3) Preclinical testing of compounds with adjuvant activity emerging from the above research.  The ultimate goal of this effort is to protect the human population from infectious diseases; therefore, research must result in adjuvants that are effective in the human innate immune system.  This RFP is discovery focused and does not solicit proposals to study already known adjuvants or adjuvants currently in development.  Detailed information on the technical requirements follows in the ?Technical Objectives? section. Projects concerning adjuvants for biodefense that are not within the scope of this solicitation may be eligible for support by other NIAID solicitations as indicated on the web page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/bioterrorism/fund_opp_table.htm.  Inquiries may be directed to Program Staff indicated on the web site.

It is anticipated that up to five (5) cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of five (5) years each, beginning approximately September 30, 2003.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BAA-03-41 will be available electronically on or about September 27, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/cgi-shl/cmb/rfps.cfm. Please note that the RFP for this acquisition only includes the work statement, deliverable and reporting requirements, special requirements, the technical evaluation criteria, and the proposal preparation instructions. All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package. Following proposal submission and the initial review process, Offerors comprising the competitive range will be asked to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer. Responses to this RFP will be due approximately January 7, 2003.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  Point of contact: Wanda Neal, Contract Specialist at wneal@niaid.nih.gov, telephone: (301) 496-0189, FAX: (301) 480-5253 you may also contact Paul McFarlane, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 496-0349, email pm24@nih.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plans to issue an order on a sole source basis to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b), Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The objective of this requirement is to assist in the development of a theoretical and empirical basis for deploying NIST's Office of Applied Economic (OAE) cost-effectiveness tool for evaluating and mitigating the consequences of extreme events. Tasks include: 1) summarize the factors leading to the successful implementation of mitigation measures in recent years; 2) develop procedures for estimating potential benefits (both direct and indirect) from alternative mitigation measures and their associated costs and apply then to a selected set of measures to generate estimated values; 3) prepare a technical report documenting and synthesizing the finds from Tasks 1 and 2; and 4) develop procedures for testing and evaluating OAE's cost-effective tool and apply then to the beta version of the software product. The Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center of the University of Pennsylvania is the only responsible source to conduct the proposed research on implementation challenges for building safer communities. The universities' Center is the only such Center in the nation containing both risk management and decision processes in its focus.  Both elements are critical to the completion of this research.  Since its inception in 1986, the Center has carried out an internationally recognized program of basic and applied research to promote effective policies and programs for low-probability events with potentially catastrophic consequences.  The Center's reputation continuously attracts a broad cross section of stakeholders concerned with the consequences of low-probability events.  The Center is unique in its ability to link the science of risk assessment with risk perception and risk management as it relates to natural, environmental, and technological hazards.  The Center's research on risk management policies is regarded as world class due to its focus on strategies for combining private market-based mechanisms (e.g. insurance and third-party inspections) with public sector strategies (e.g., government-based regulations and standards).  Building on the disciplines of economics, decision sciences, operations and information management, finance, insurance, marketing, and psychology, the Center's research program is unique in its focus on both descriptive and prescriptive analyses of relevant risk management issues.  Descriptive research focuses on how individuals and organizations interact and make decisions regarding the management of risk.  Prescriptive analyses propose ways that individuals and organizations, both private and governmental, can make better decisions regarding risk.  NIST cosponsored a June 11, 2002 Roundtable on Economic Incentives for Building Safer Communities that brought together key decision-makers and planners from the construction industry, government, real estate, financial and insurance institutions, and academic to identify economic incentives and discuss the next steps for using them to build safer communities.  The Roundtable participants recommended all tasks specified. One firm-fixed purchase order will be awarded. This requirement will not be split. The period of performance will be from date of award through June 30, 2004. The anticipated award date of this order is on or about 4 days from the date of this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation. Interested persons may identify their intent and capability to respond to the requirement no later than the response date above. Questions must be received by September 18, 2002 cob. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For information, call the POC identified below.

Analyses will entail simple descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses, and a variety of regression models.

Dr. James R. Hebert and Dr. Thomas G Hurley of the University of South Carolina have been involved with prior analysis for this project and therefore have considerable knowledge and expertise of the data format and overall project analytical plan. Data for these analyses will be collected at seven different research sites (primary investigation was funded under the BCC Dietary Validation substudy grants) and forwarded to the University of South Carolina for processing.  Individual reports to each site provide the results from the data analyses conducted for each site.  A final combined report of the analyses across sites will be generated and shared with all sites.  Data from these analyses will be used to generate a peer-review publication. The contractor shall provide HPRB the final report sixty days after award of the contract.  Performance period is sixty days from date of award. FAR clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services is applicable.Dr's.

Award to the University of South Carolina is necessary in order to maintain the consistency of the database and contract expertise.

HPRB, NC I is sponsoring Dr. Hebert and Dr. Hurley to work with the lead Principal Investigators from each of the seven sites on data analyses to validate a 10-item fruit and vegetable screener, a 7-item fat screener, both developed by NCI with 24-hour food recall and Food Frequency Questionnaire data.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms in the Small Business Administrations (SBA) Regions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8(Wyoming) and those 8(a) firms with bona-fide places of business in these SBA districts (See http://www.sba.gov/regions/map/ to view Region Map).  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to be selected from 8(a) firms, within specified SBA districts, that meet the qualification requirements as set forth in this announcement.  Those firms that can demonstrate that they meet the qualification requirements will be awarded a BOA.  The estimated period of performance for the BOAs will be one year (1) with the Navy reserving the right to exercise options for up to four years, with no single option exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c).  BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the specified SBA District Offices.  While there may not be opportunities in every district within the regions cited, potential work has already been identified for the Jacksonville and Miami SBA Districts in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, and the Dallas/Fort Worth and Harlingen SBA Districts in Texas.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The Navy will compete task orders issued under the BOAs among the BOA holders.  Each task order that is issued under the BOA shall constitute a separate contract.

<SUBJECT>A -- Hybrid-Electric Vehicles Demonstration and Evaluation Project
<DESC>This is notice of a proposed sole source modification under Other Transaction Agreement DTRS56-99-T-0017 between the U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration and the Hawaii Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP) to provide funding in support of an advanced vehicle technologies demonstration and evaluation program between the State of Hawaii, High Technology Development Corporation (HTDC) under its HEVDP consortium and the U.S. Air Force.  The U.S. Air Force Advanced Power Technologies Office (APTO) has an arrangement with HEVDP to demonstrate and evaluate alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) technologies at Hickam AFB, Hawaii.  This initiative has generated a partnership to apply dual-use technologies in helping the military services meet the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) requirements for clean fuel vehicles. The Department of Transportation began supporting the AFV project at Hickam AFB in FY 2001 through its Other Transactions Agreement with HEVDP under the Advanced Vehicle Technologies Program (AVP).  Phase I of the project included purchase and installation of rapid chargers, integration of a 120kW Electric Drive system into a 100kW hybrid drive bus, a warranty/service program; and a data collection effort.  The purpose of this second and final phase of this project is to develop comparison testing for heavy vehicles, and introduce multi-charging systems.
