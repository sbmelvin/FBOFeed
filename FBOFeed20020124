<DESC>POC Purchasing Agent, Gaynelle Parker, 2212, (619)553-0889. Contracting Officer, Wayne Johnson, 2211, (619)553-9046 DESC: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with FAR Part 13.   No hard copy Request for Quote (RFQ) will be prepared or made available for distribution.  Award will be based on responsive, responsible, technically acceptable low bids.  The government intends to award, on a sole source basis, a maintenance contract to Ultratech Stepper in accordance with the following Statement of Work (SOW).  STATEMENT OF WORK: INTRODUCTION:  The purpose of this contract is to provide routine preventive maintenance and emergency repairs as required for the XLS-7300 i-line stepper in the Integrated Circuit Fabrication Facility (ICFF) of SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego (SSC SD). The stepper is a complex electromechanical optical system that is used to produce patterns on silicon wafers for the manufacture of electronic devices and integrated circuits. It utilizes several light sources each with specific purposes and includes mercury arc lamps and lasers.  The critical elements of the stepper are enclosed in a chamber where temperature and humidity are carefully controlled.  The sensitive electromechanical system provides precise alignment, rotation, focus, and exposure to produce circuit elements that are 0.5 microns or smaller and place them within 0.1 micron of the intended location relative to as many as 15 underlying patterns. Proper operation including precise imaging and positioning requires frequent attention by highly trained service engineers.  Rapid response is required in the case of system failure because the stepper is the critical element in a process flow that requires the use of the stepper as much as twenty times as much as any other equipment in the manufacture of a typical product. If the stepper stops working, the fabrication work is halted. SCOPE  The purpose of this contract is to provide for the routine preventive maintenance and emergency repair as required for the XLS-7300 i-line stepper in the Integrated Circuit Fabrication Facility (ICFF) of SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego (SSC SD).  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: Contractor shall:  Schedule and perform on-site routine preventive maintenance (PM) of the stepper once every month during the contract period. A PM will include:  Cleaning and lubrication of all mechanical systems.  Installation of and proper uniformity adjustment of mercury arc lamps. Checking, recording and correcting for registration overlay errors. Back up system constants and job setup data to tape. Place a field service engineer on site within twenty-four (24) hours of notification of a functional failure that requires emergency service as determined by ICFF personnel.  Provide technical support via telephone. Provide PM, technical support, and emergency services during the period from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm on Monday through Friday excluding holidays. The contractor and the ICFF personnel depending upon circumstances and in the best interests of the operation of the stepper may mutually agree upon exceptions. Provide all parts for the performance of the maintenance and repair of the stepper excluding the projection lens and the following consumables which will be provided by the SSC SD ICFF if required: Mercury arc lamps, frosty wafers, O-rings, printer parts or materials, test reticules, floppy disks, autoloader belts, filters, and fuses. CONTRACT PERIOD Twelve (12) months from the date of award. TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVES Mark Roser, Code D876,  (619) 553-1554, Fabrication Manager, Charley Young, Code D876,  (619) 553-3890, Lead Engineer Photolithography. Other Security: Work performed on this task will be unclassified. Place of Performance: SPAWARSYSCEN, San Diego, Bldg 560N Facsimile quotations may be sent to (619)553-1062.  Questions may be directed to Gaynelle Parker (619)553-0889, email parkerg@spawar.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the overhaul/repair of an estimated annual quantity of 150 each Amplitron Tubes, NSN 5960-00-023-9482, Litton Systems Inc. (Litton), P/N L4953R, Raytheon Service Co., P/N QK653 and Electronics Industries Assoc., P/N RK7577.  Raytheon, who subsequently sold that division to Litton, originally manufactured the tubes.  The proposed contractor is Northrop Grumman, Williamsport PA, who recently acquired the Electron Devices Division of Litton Systems Inc.  The proposed contract provides for major overhaul or modification services in support of Air Route Surveillance Radar Models 1 and 2 (ARSR 1/2) systems.  The ARSR 1/2 are integral part of the Air Traffic control system.  Requirement is for a base year and includes option provisions to renew for four additional 1-year periods, to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA.  The proposed contract will incorporate AMS Clause 3.2.4-35, Option to Extend the Te! rm of the Contract, and 3.2.4-34, Option to Extend Services. <P> Raytheon originally built the ARSR 1 & 2 systems in 1957 specifically for the FAA.  In 1994 Raytheon sold their tube division to Litton.  This acquisition included the proprietary rights for repair of original tubes applicable to the ARSR 1 and 2 systems, as well as the test set for testing rebuild/overhaul of amplitron tubes.  The test set is a one of a kind unit, which was built specifically for testing the rebuild/overhaul of amplitron tubes in order to maintain FAAs stringent safety and reliability standards.  The amplitron electronic characteristics cannot be measured and aligned without the use of this test set.   <P> The repair processes are proprietary to Northrop Grumman; however, the FAA has revised FAA Logistics Center Specification, FAA-D-1275, Tube, Electron, Amplitron, which coupled with a company's knowledge and experience should enable other vendors to be qualified to rebuild/overhaul these tubes.  However, a vendor must have access to a test set, which will be required in order to accomplish system testing.  The FAA does not have a test set to provide to a contractor as Government Furnished Property.   <P> Interested vendors that have the capabilities and access to a test set should respond with their documentation and proof of availability of test set to the Contracting Officer. <P>

<DESC>VIDEO SURVEILLANCE INSTALLATION PROJECT

This project is for the installation, calibration, training and warranty of video surveillance equipment at Malmstrom AFB, MT.  A list of government provided equipment follows with quantity, manufacture and model. The equipment will be installed into ten (10) separate locations, described as military base dormitory housing. Buildings are constructed using concrete interior walls and floors and are treated as firewall. All fire wall penetrations must be treated in compliance with local codes.  Electrical and video cabling installation will be in accordance with existing local code.  Buildings will be occupied at the time of installation and contractor must take this into account when evaluating project to minimize disruption. All necessary installation materials used to install the equipment listed below are to be supplied by the contractor.  Time needed for installation is also an issue and will be considered as part of the proposal.   Upon project completion, training on the total operation of the system(s) will be provided to at least four (4) dormitory management personnel.  Installation parts and labor must be warranted for one (1) year after completion for defects in workmanship and quality.  During the warranty period contractor must supply on-site warranty labor and materials on the hardware supplied by the government. In addition during the one (1) year following the contractor must provide a minimum of at least two (2) on site visits for retraining. An on site visit to evaluate the project is highly recommended as building plans will not be supplied.  This will be a service, so all labor shall fall under the Service Contract Act.  This project is also set-aside 100% for small business.  For any questions contact Amn D.J. Thompson at (406) 731-4554 phone, (406) 731-4005 fax, or email me at Donald.Thompson@malmstrom.af.mil

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Kunitz and Associates, Inc. (KAI), 6001 Montrose Road, Suite 920, Rockville, MD under existing contract N01-NS-4-2320, 1,863 hours of additional labor effort to the current term, January 1, 2002 through March 31, 2002.  The current contract with KAI is entitled NINDS-sponsored Clinical Research Coordinating Center and requires data management, quality control, and data analysis for ongoing clinical trials sponsored by NINDS.  This new work will require KAI to continue performing the quality control and data analyses and includes biostatistical support for the NINDS Extramural Program.  Activities shall include, but are not limited to, auditing sponsored clinical trials, reviewing and providing recommendations regarding statistical design, reviewing clinical trial methodology, and performing analyses.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  KAI has been determined to be the only responsible source because of the staff's familiarity with the various on-going clinical trials supported by the NINDS.  KAI is in an optimal position to provide this work in a timely and cost-effective manner.  This organization has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their experience to date under the contract.  Inherent duplication of the cost to the Government and unacceptable performance delay make competition for the extension of the contract and for the additional labor effort unfeasible.

Statement of Work - Simultaneous Interpreter (Russian)
SABIT Standards Program

Background

The Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration's Special American Business Internship Training Program (SABIT), is managing a specialized program in Standards to train standards, certification, and testing professionals from Russia and the New Independent States (NIS). 
		
The Training Program will consist of three four-week training sessions with approximately seventeen to twenty participants each. The first two weeks of each Training Session will be provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  The remaining two-week portion of each Training Session, will consist of visits to private companies (Host Firms) and industry expositions, with SABIT overseeing all training and program development.

Purpose and Objectives

This requirement is for a simultaneous Interpreter(Russian- English; English-Russian) for the Training Program.  The program dates are as follows: Standards Program for Telecommunications: February 23-March 23, 2002; Standards Program for Oil and Gas: June 1 - June 29, 2002; Standards Program for Information Technology: October 19 - November 16, 2002.  It is anticipated there will be two Interpreters assigned to each program.  

The period of performance of this requirement is from the effective date through twelve (12) months with an option for two additional 12-months.  The Interpreter will travel with the group throughout each four-week Training Session.  Interpreters shall be responsible for all sessions, orientations, seminars, receptions and other activities involved in the four week training program.  Additionally, simultaneous interpreting rates will be paid for weekdays and escort rates on the weekends for each four-week session. 

Interpreters agree to be housed in the same lodging facility as the interns while traveling outside of interpreter's city of residence; be on call to assist participants in case of emergency day or night.

Additionally, travel costs, lodging and per diem will be provided outside of the interpreter's city of residence.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration shall provide each interpreter with the following:

1.  All travel and lodging costs for the interpreters associated with the non-residential city portions of the training programs.  
2.  A government per diem for the duration of the non-residential city based travel (amount varies by city).
3.  Wireless interpreting equipment and batteries.
4.  The SABIT Program will pay the contractor for interpretation services in two installments:  one every two weeks, under "immediate payment" regulations.  Each payment will cover 14 days of interpretation services each at the daily rate (simultaneous for week days and at the escort rate for weekends). Any translation work may be paid separately.

Optional: (Consultation and translation services):

1.  Translate group travel schedules into Russian.
2.  Translate intern exit surveys.

Basis of Evaluation:

Offerors will be evaluated based on their experience, education and training shown on their application as it relates to the evaluation criteria listed below:

Evaluation Criteria:

1.  Skills comparable to a State Department seminar-level simultaneous interpreter from English to Russian and Russian to English. (Note: skills will be assessed)
2. Experience serving as an escort interpreter (English-Russian; Russian-English) for weekend activities
3.  Ability to communicate effectively and professionally in Russian and English.
4.  Experience working with technical training programs and a highly technical vocabulary 
5.  Ability to understand and recognize the needs and interests of the host company and the group. The ability to facilitate communications between the two.	
6.  Ability to perform liaison functions among various organizations involved in the SABIT  Program
7.  Previous work experience with delegations of this size and programs of this duration.
8.  Diplomatic, yet assertive manner.	
9.  Ability to translate written material Russian to English, English to Russian 
10.  Willingness to work on weekends and evenings when necessary as escort interpreter.

Evaluation of Quotation:

The award will be made on a ?best value basis', giving due consideration to price, approach, and past performance.  The approach and past performance are considered to be more important than price, however, the closer they are in terms of the approach, the more important price will become.   It is requested that prices be quoted based on daily rates for work at the simultaneous interpreter rate as well as for work at the escort rate.

Attachment A

SABIT Standards in Telecommunications Program

The Delegation

SABIT Standards in Telecommunications delegations are generally composed of 17-20 government sector telecommunications specialists representing Russia and the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union (NIS).  Agencies represented include national and regional standards agencies, testing laboratories, and state telecommunications companies.

The Program

The SABIT telecom program will consist of a two-week training session at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  Discussions there will focus on --  1) U.S. practices in standards development, certification, and laboratory accreditation,  2) the U.S. regulatory process and government-wide standards activities, and 3) NIST/DOC activities in the telecommunications sector.  Site visits may include the FCC, the Telecommunications Industry Association, the Information Technology Industry Council,  Comsat, and the AT&T Technology Center.  

After the completion of the NIST training, the group will visit a variety of telecommunications technology companies and testing labs, anticipated to be in New Jersey, New York, and Boston, (i.e., UL, Intertek Testing, and Lucent Technologies.) These site visits will be followed by the delegation's participation in Wireless 2002 in Orlando, Florida.  This trade show is billed as the largest telecommunications event in the world, with 700+ telecommunications companies represented, and a projected attendance of 70,000. 

Regional Issues

Prior to setting the SABIT Standards Program agenda for the year 2002, NIST staff queried BISNIS* consultants and economic attaches at U.S. embassies in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to determine what training topics might best serve the needs of U.S. industry.  Difficulties with the certification of telecommunications equipment were mentioned repeatedly as stumbling blocks by U.S. companies trying to enter the CIS market.

Mission

The goals of the SABIT Telecom Program are --  1) to provide information on effective and efficient practices of equipment certification used in the U.S,  2) to inspire confidence in U.S. products,  3) to encourage further development of the elecommunications sector in CIS countries, and 4) to identify global trends in equipment certification.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM) intends to issue Request for Proposals (RFP) No. N00039-02-R-0001 for the award of a cost plus award fee (CPAF) contract for the Taiwan Advanced Tactical Data Link System (TATDLS). TATDLS is a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program to provide the implementation of defensive warfare area capability enhancements representative of Link 16-like functionality for the Taiwan Military.  The acquisition encompasses final TATDLS design and development of hardware and software, integration, test, installation and training for numerous platform/systems. Issuance of the RFP is subject to approval of the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) of the FMS case. The prospective contract will be for one (1) year with four (4) one-year options. This is a full and open competition. However, only companies holding a current U.S. Department of Defense CONFIDENTIAL facility security clearance or appropriately cleared Taiwan companies may obtain and respond to the prospective solicitation. Qualified prospective offerors will access the solicitation via electronic means only from the SPAWARSYSCOM Virtual Program Office (VPO) web site entitled "PMW-159 TDLP Phase 2" (URL is https://vpo.spawar.navy.mil). Any amendments, when issued, will also be available only on this web site. A Bidders Mailing List will not be established and hard copies of documents will not be provided.  All personnel having access to this RFP or access to information concerning the procurement after contract award, to include subcontractor personnel, must be US citizens or Taiwan citizen personnel.  A CONFIDENTIAL security clearance will be required for all personnel with access to US CONFIDENTIAL information, Taiwan CONFIDENTIAL information, Taiwan RESTRICTED information, and Taiwan unclassified information provided on the condition that it will be treated "in confidence". Qualified entities may obtain access to the VPO by both: (1) Going to the VPO web site and making an on-line request for the PMW-159 TDLP Phase 2 VPO. For the blocks related to "person who can confirm your need for access", insert Jon Wester, phone (619) 524-7176, e-mail westerj@spawar.navy.mil. (2) Sending an e-mail request directly to Jon Wester (telephone requests will not be honored). This request shall state the company's name, address, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and point of contact name, e-mail and telephone number. Also, the request shall include a signed and dated copy of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) on company letterhead.  The NDA shall state the following: "[Company Name] understands that certain information related to the prospective Request for Proposals (RFP) No. N00039-02-R-0001 is considered classified and/or sensitive by the Taiwan Government and that such information will be marked to indicate that it is restricted for the eyes of U.S. and/or Taiwan citizens only. [Company Name] agrees to limit its employees' access to all such RFP information in accordance with the marked restriction. [Company Name] also agrees to limit dissemination of all RFP information outside its company to firms that have a Department of Defense CONFIDENTIAL facility security clearance or are appropriately cleared Taiwanese companies. [Company Name] also affirms that it will obtain an agreement with the same language contained herein from any firm to which it disseminates RFP information." Requesters shall forward the NDA as an attachment to the e-mail request and include an electronic signature or be formatted as a scanned version of a signed hardcopy. Parties approved for VPO access will be notified by e-mail. It is important to note that, prior to solicitation release, the VPO will provide access to TATDLS background information, as well as a draft RFP. In addition, parties granted access to the VPO will be invited to attend an Industry Day in San Diego, CA on 12 February 2002. The Industry Day will provide potential offerors with an opportunity to review the draft RFP with Government personnel and receive answers to RFP-related questions. Parties who do not submit a timely request for VPO access disqualify themselves from attending Industry Day. Notification of the release of important solicitation announcements (such as the date of RFP issuance, etc) will be made via the SPAWAR E-Commerce Web Page at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. This site is different from the VPO. Thus, it is essential that parties approved for VPO access also review the SPAWAR E-Commerce Web Page regularly. Issuance of the solicitation is estimated for March 2002. Contract award is estimated for July 2002. The projected proposal due date/time in this synopsis is an estimate only; the actual proposal due date/time will be established in the final RFP.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with Illinois officials, requires three (3) firm, fixed-priced, requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennnis (Motschulsky) within the State of Illinois.  The first contract will cover the Chicago area, the second contract will cover Summit, and the third is for Addison, Park Ridge, and O'Hare.  The application is intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees. ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, and London Plane. This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture has declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  This spring APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 3,000 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 36,000 by Mauget trunk injection and an estimated 30,000 trees with an estimated total dbh of 364,000 by soil injection in the Chicago area.  Eight hundred, eighty-six (886) trees with an estimated total dbh of  10,400 are projected for soil injection treatment in the Summit area.  Addison, Park Ridge, and O'Hare are projecting an estimated 11,200 trees with an estimated total dbh of 80,800 for Mauget trunk injection. The effective period of the contract will be from date of award through December 31, 2002.  Spring Mauget treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer. PPQ intends to begin soil injection treatments on or about March 4, 2002.  Spring soil injection treatments must be completed on or about April 26, 2002.  Mauget trunk injection treatments will begin on or about April 22, 2002, and must be completed by May 31, 2002.  The solicitation (request for proposals - rfp) will be issued on or about February 1, 2002, to prospective offerors.  Offers are due to the Contracting Officer by 10:00 A.M., Central Time, Friday, February 15, 2002. SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED. The short 2-week turnaround time is due to the unusual and compelling urgency created by the infestation of ALB.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs, and  other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code: 115310.  Size Standard: $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Interested companies may request a copy of the RFP by sending a fax or e-mail request to the Contracting Officer at (612) 370-2106.  The RFP may be downloaded off the Internet after February 1, 2002, or within 2 days after the issuance of the RFP, from the following Internet site: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html  TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR A COPY OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<DESC>A -- Research & Development
Commercialization and Licensing of Nickel Aluminide technology
Please address all correspondence to: G. W. Joe (email: joegw@ornl.gov)

UT-Battelle, LLC (UT-Battelle), the management and operating contractor for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) under the authority of its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy, is seeking expressions of interest from companies for licensing and commercialization of ORNL's intellectual property in the technology area of nickel aluminide.

In alloys of nickel and aluminum there are two intermetallic compounds of significant commercial interest.  One of these two intermetallic compounds is based on alloys of nickel with aluminum and other elements that results in metallic materials that can be described by the ordered crystal structure of Ni(3)Al.  These nickel aluminide alloys have unique properties that make them attractive candidates for many high temperature applications.

The nickel aluminide alloy commonly referred to as IC221M in published information is covered by ASTM A1002-99, "Standard Specification for Castings, Nickel-Aluminum Ordered Alloy."  As the ASTM Specification title indicates, the IC221M alloy is intended for use as metal cast parts.  The nominal chemical composition of IC221M in weight percent is: nickel balance - 8 aluminum -7.7 chromium - 1.43 molybdenum - 1.7 zirconium.  The ordered crystal structure of IC221M contributes to its unusual properties.  For example, the strength of the alloy increases above its room temperature strength as it is heated to 700-900?C.  Additionally, it maintains relatively high strength to nearly 1100?C.  Besides its high strength, the alloy forms a highly protective aluminum oxide surface scale that makes it very resistant to further oxidation and carburization.  These properties make the IC221M alloy an attractive replacement for the traditional heat-resistant alloys commonly used for heat-treating fixtures.  For example, the typical life of a heat-treating tray made from a more conventional cast austenitic alloy is 12-15 months.  In side-by-side testing in a commercial batch heat-treating furnace for steel parts, nickel aluminide trays were still in use with no failures after over 3? years of service.  The initial cost of the nickel aluminide trays is 1?-2 times higher than traditional alloys, but extended tray life more than offsets the higher initial tray cost.  It is anticipated that the nickel aluminide trays will also permit increases in throughput per furnace.  A range of additional heat treating applications and other metal processing applications are anticipated for the IC221M nickel aluminide alloy including fixtures for carburizing furnaces, radiant tubes, fans, rolls, and dies.

UT-Battelle is interested in licensing the technology for producing and fabricating nickel aluminide parts.  Any interested company is encouraged to respond to this announcement as soon as possible.  It is anticipated that the best-qualified respondents will have well-established expertise in casting heat resistant and other advanced alloys.  Companies with in-house capabilities for both static casting and centrifugal casting are especially sought.  Other desirable capabilities include expertise for machining high strength metals, and for welding advanced alloys by both manual and automated techniques.  An established reputation in and knowledge of the heat-treating business is also viewed as highly desirable.

The technology transfer process will be facilitated through appropriate licensing of UT-Battelle's intellectual property between UT-Battelle and the Licensee. Interested companies with experience and expertise commensurate with the requirements of this commercialization effort are invited to respond to this announcement. Companies interested in this opportunity may obtain more detailed technical information and description of the licensing process by submitting a statement of interest, including a written description of their company and its activities and an explanation of their potential application of the technology.  One-page expression of interest should be received by March 29, 2002. No licensing intermediaries please.  This is not a procurement activity.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place: His Excellency Dr. Fawaz H. Zu?bi, Minister, Ministry of Post and Communications, 8th Circle, Wadi es-Sir, P.O. Box 9903, Amman 11191, Jordan, Telephone:  (962-6) 582-1644, Fax:  (962-6) 585-1305

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to examine wireless sector market liberalization as well as the deployment, development and licensing of advanced wireless technology in Jordan.

The Ministry of Post and Communications (MoPC) in Jordan seeks assistance in planning for the liberalization of its mobile and wireless services as part of its commitment to WTO ascension and its Free Trade Agreement with the United States.  The current exclusive wireless franchises awarded by MoPC are set to expire December 31, 2003, and the Ministry seeks to establish a strategic plan with regard to the licensing decisions and the next generation technology options that must be undertaken before that date.

A license was awarded for the provision of cellular mobile (GSM) services to a private company in 1994, the sale of forty percent of the Jordan Telecom Company (JTC) was made to a consortium composed of France Telecom and local investors in January 2000, and a second GSM license to MobileCom, an affiliate of JTC.  Each of the above licenses includes a period of exclusivity.  JTC?s license gives it exclusivity for basic domestic and international telecommunications services, including voice telephone, telex, telegraph and leased circuit services through December 31, 2004.  As noted, the two GSM licenses provide for a joint period of exclusivity through December 31, 2003.

The decision to license other operators of mobile service presents several options, each with advantages and disadvantages as well as costs and benefits for Jordan?s industrial and economic development, its government, and its citizens.  On the one hand, Jordan?s demographic, economic and technological characteristics indicate that it may be time to plan for third generation (3G) wireless technology and its promised access to data services.  Alternatively, the economic environment may point to further use of proven GSM technologies or perhaps even other technology choices.  A decision on this next stage of mobile market liberalization must be taken soon to allow for proper service planning and rollout.  A number of options may be feasible and need to be explored.  

The objective of the Technical Assistance is to examine wireless sector market liberalization as well as the deployment, development and licensing of advanced wireless technology.  The tasks for the Technical Assistance are summarized as follows:  
1) project definition - technology, 2) market assessment, 3) regulatory assessment, 4) economic and financial evaluation, 5) environmental assessment, 6) risk assessment, and 7) final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $268,099 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., Monday, March 11, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  (ii) This solicitation, DCMA01-02-Q-0003, is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  (iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC# 2001-03. (iv) This solicitation is UNRESTRICTED.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 511199 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The small business competitiveness demonstration program does not apply.  (v) A list of contract line item numbers (CLINs)is as follows:  0001 Financial Training Service, 1 job in Clearwater, FL; 0002 Financial Training Service, 1 job in Long Beach, CA  (vi) Description :  Performance Work Statement (PWS) is as follows:  
1. Background: Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) is an agency that performs contract administration services for the Department of Defense and other Federal Agencies.   Monitoring a contractor?s financial condition is a fundamental part of our contract administration services.  Performing financial analysis encompasses the inclusion of the affects of contract financing arrangements, i.e.,   Progress Payments, Advanced Payments and Performance Based Payments. Contract financing puts the Government at risk for not receiving items it has paid for through financing.  DCMA desires to further train and develop DCMA Contract Specialist/Cost Price Analysts (GS-11-12-13) in assessing the financial conditions of various size companies who contract with DoD.  
2.  Objectives:
The objective of the training is to provide the DCMA Contract Specialist/Cost and Price Analysts with learning exercises/activities that they can apply on the job to analyze accurately a Government contractor?s financial capability to remain solvent throughout the duration of the Government contract(s) in order to successfully complete the contract work.   The DCMA analysts must be capable of performing comprehensive financial analyses on various size contractors/companies using the proper and generally accepted methods of performing those analyses, including the consideration of industry standards, economic outlooks, trend analysis and forecasting in order to achieve reliable results and conclusions that can be solidly justified. 
3.  Scope - Training.  The Contractor shall perform services required to prepare instruction for and teach a workshop style class on the subject of financial analysis and the concepts as it pertains to both large and small businesses and their liquidity and financial viability.  The training must cover fundamental principles and processes, as well as provide hand-on exercises for solvency prediction/financial capability analysis.    The training shall be conducted in Clearwater, FL during the May 14-16, 2002 time frame and in Long Beach, CA in the June 4-6, 2002 time frame.  Approximately 25 DCMA students will need to be trained at each site.  If the bidder provides the facilities as part of their cost and it remains within the funds available for this training, then the vendor?s location within the listed geographical areas would be considered. Training includes standardized materials (i.e., final lesson plans, instruction guides, appropriate handouts, exercises, participant guides/references, certificates). Topics that need to be covered in this financial analysis training include:  
How to read and interpret a company?s financial statements
Standard Financial ratios- what they are and what they mean- include an exercise or demonstration on how to perform the most commonly used ratios.  This must include how to compare the ratios within the same industry types. 
The contractor?s business base- the importance of knowing what constitutes it and what implications or influence the private work portion may have on the government work portion of the base.
Cash Flow Analysis-How to review/analyze and what to look for as warning signs. Debt load and debt repayment- how do they affect the company short term and long term?
Economic Analysis- Understanding how economic climates/conditions affect the contractor?s financial condition.
Trend Analysis- review fundamentals and application 
Forecasting- Basic Principles of forecasting to apply to make a complete financial analysis /financial viability assessment of the company.
Altman?s Z Score- Explain it?s use and the assumptions inherent in the model as well as how to consider it in the overall financial review?
Dun and Bradstreet ratings- Understanding their rating information and how it is derived
Risk Management Associates (RMA)-Understanding the comparisons and the application/use of the information. 
Any other related information used to make reliable financial analysis/assessments of a company?s financial condition.  Ensure that topics and conditions relevant to both small, privately owned businesses as well as large publicly held companies are covered.
4.  Plan of Instruction (POI).    In addition to basic academic instruction on how to perform financial analysis, the contractor is to provide three case studies/ simulations to work through and analyze during the class that will contain and consider Government financing arrangements as part of the scenario in at least two of the cases.  DCMA will provide input and feedback during the preparation of the case studies so that business-financing arrangements that are applicable to Government contracting are incorporated into at least two of the cases.  Government Business financing arrangements to be used are progress payments, and advance payments.  The contractor?s course content and case study/simulation exercises must be reviewed and accepted by DCMA.   The contractor must submit the instruction plan content and case studies/simulations to the DCMA POC within 30 calendar days after contract award.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the Anti Tamper solicitation initially published on 28 Mar 01.  The PRDA still remains open until 22 May 02 for out-of-cycle proposals from the original solicitation. Proposals submitted in response to this amendment for Software Protection Initiatives (SPI)  will be due no later than 28 Feb 02; 4:00 pm local time. This PRDA continues to be open until 22 May 2002.  Out-of-Cycle proposals will be accepted until 22 May 2002.  However, there is no guarantee of funding for proposals received after 28 Feb 02 and before 22 May 2002.  NOTE:  The contracting points of contact have changed, see paragraph 11. above.  Also, the technical point of contact for SPI is Dr. Martin Stytz, who can be reached at (937) 255-2811 ext 4380 or by pager at (407) 497-4407.  The overall objective of the Software Protection Initiatives (SPI) is to identify, study, and evaluate the key technologies needed to strengthen current software protection capabilities for scientific, engineering, modeling, simulation, and operational software that executes on special-purpose and general-purpose computers. The SPI topics include the following research areas: software protection S&E tools, software protection forensics, software protection research investigations/experiments; software protection security policies; software protection component security software contracts, computation accuracy security; computation precision security; computation precision and accuracy control and access; execution host management and traceability; distribution accountability; software protection and distribution sensors; distribution and copy traceability; binary inspection protection; secure notification of use or reuse; software distribution management and accountability; development of software protection science; development of science-based metrics & methods for software protection; and multi-level protection.  Additional topics include component-level software protection; component-based software protection; module-based software protection; module-level software protection; distributed software system protection; inherent access control & management; autonomous protection; autonomous, unsupervised protection assessment; protection of scientific and engineering applications; protection of modeling and simulation applications; design, development, and evaluation of software protection technologies; distribution traceability; protection of operational software on general purpose computers; and multiyear software protection and distribution defense.  Further topics are computational accuracy and precision control; automatic and inherent misuse notification; software protection conceptual design and documentation; technology transition; reference prototype implementations; composable, scalable, and separable protection technologies; protection technology visualization; defensive system biological model paradigms; software architecture to enhance software protection; and technology tools & theory.  Other topics include virtual machine approaches to achieving software protection at the component, framework, aspect, and object levels; protection metrics development and evaluation; component trust and security assurance; technologies for self-destruct or accuracy degradation upon misuse detection; and software protection technologies for mobile code.  While this amendment seeks the development of technologies that enhance the protection of software, the government anticipates that there will be a hardware component to some of the technologies proposed for software protection.  Therefore, hardware solutions are encouraged and the research related to the list of topics provided above or other topics related to the SPI may have both a hardware and a software aspect. Network security, intrusion prevention, intrusion detection are outside the scope of this amendment.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation and this amendment synopsisby accessing the Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/.

<DESC>NA (Amended 24 January 2002) This Procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award a maximum of two Design Build Multiple Award Task Order (MATOC) Contracts. Offerors will be required to submit a technical proposal with a separate price propo sal. Contracts will be awarded to those firms providing the best value to the Government. The contracting officer intends to award based on initial offers received without discussions of such offers, although discussions may be held if in the best interest  of the Government. Technical evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may become a determining factor for awa rd. Based on best value, an award may not necessarily go to the highest rated technical proposal or to the lowest price offer. A tradeoff process may be used to determine the best overall value.  If multiple contracts are awarded, the Government may compete the work among the contractors based on performance and other factors set forth in the contract. Each awardee will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for subsequent task orders. Tas k orders under these contracts could be issued in one of the following methods: (a) Competitive RFP, Firm Fixed Price; (b) Sole Source RFP, Firm Fixed Price.  ORDER LIMITATIONS: The contract duration will be for a base ordering period of one year, or until the maximum ordering capacity of $5,000,000 has been exhausted. The contract also provides for up to two optional ordering periods of one year each, or until the maximum ordering capacity of  $5,000,000 for any given period has been exhausted. No single task order shall exceed the amount of $5,000,000.00, and the maximum contract value, including all options, shall not exceed $15,000,000. If multiple awards are  made, this will be a shared capacity.  GENERAL SCOPE: Task orders under this contract may include design services, construction services, or a combination of design-build services. The Government will provide requirements for each task order in addition to any contractor provided studies/invest igation reports which may include one or more of the following: performance based specifications, conceptual drawings and specifications or definitive designs with prescriptive specifications.  Design services may include, but are not limited to, security engineering and vulnerability surveys, for interagency domestic antiterrorism, force protection, and homeland defense. The services provided in these technical areas could include studies, inves tigations, reports, and evaluations for the modification of existing facilities; analysis of structural and mechanical systems using computer methodologies; and preparation of detailed design drawings, specifications, shop drawings, work plans and other su bmittals for construction services. Disciplines required may include architectural, civil, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, structural, HVAC, instrumentation, information management systems, environmental, security, and safety design.

<CONTACT>Thomas Young, Regional Contracting Officer, Phone 913-551-1044, Fax 913-551-1074, Email tyoung@bop.gov
<DESC>The due date for proposals has been clarified as January 31, 2002. The original solicitation, including its cover letter, dated December 13, 2001 indicated a proposal due date of January 31, 2002. However, the synopsis on this website indicated a due date of February 1, 2002. The minutes, which will be issued as an amendment, will also indicate a due date of January 31, 2001. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to make a single contract award to a responsible entity for the provision of inpatient hospital facility services and various physician services (out-patient and in-patient) for the Federal Prison Camp located at Yankton, South Dakota (hereinafter referred to as FPC Yankton).  The provision of hospital in-patient services shall be accomplished using facilities within a 10-mile radius of FPC Yankton.  FPC Yankton is located at 1016 Douglas Avenue, Yankton, South Dakota, 57078. Officially designated as a LOW/MINIMUM CUSTODY LEVEL institution, FPC Yankton has an inmate-population of approximately six-hundred convicted felons of diverse nationalities. FPC Yankton is an all-male institution with primarily healthy inmates.

When medical needs arise which cannot be provided internally by FPC Yankton?s medical staff and ambulatory clinic, referrals are made to community-based providers. It is the goal of this solicitation to award a contract that will provide necessary hospital facility services for both inpatient admissions and outpatient services. Additionally, the contract requires various physician services to be performed on-site at FPC Yankton and at local clinics and or offices. The following physician/specialities are required on-site at FPC Yankton: Oncologist, Gastroenterologist, Nephrologist, and Neurologist (two, six-hour visits per year); Opthmalogist, Dermatologist, ENT, Urologist, Cardiologist, and Orthopedist (five, six-hour visits per year); Psychiatry (eight hours per month); Physician services (sixty-four hours per month), and Anesthesiologist (twenty, six-hour visits per year). Additionally, the following services are also required on-site at FPC Yankton: Laboratory Technician (thirty-six hours per month); X-Ray Technician (eight hours per month); Dietician (five hours per month); Pharmacy services will also be required; and can either be on-site, or off-site (eighty hours per month). The above-listed services will also be acquired under this contract at local clinics/facilities.

FPC Yankton estimates the following, based on past requirements. The on-site out-patient physician and other services described above are annually estimated at $150,936.00; or $754,680 for the total contract of five years. FPC Yankton estimates hospital in-patient days at seven per year, valued at $14,000 per year, or $70,000 for the total contract of five years. Out-patient clinic visits are estimated at forty per year, valued at $6,000 per year, or $30,000 for the total contract of five years. Therefore, as above-described, the annual estimated value of this contract is $170,936, or $854,680 for the total contract of five years. 

This contract will consist of one base year, plus four option years. The Government retains unilateral right to exercise its option to renew each option period of one contract year. As such, there is no guarantee that the contract will continue beyond each one year period.  Additionally, the quantities and values are estimates and are not guaranteed. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 622110. This NAICS code size standard is $25.0 million in annual revenue.

The BOP intends to award an Indefinite-Delivery, Requirements-type contract with a 12 month base period and four, twelve-month option periods. Delivery orders will obligate funds for the contract, hence there is no guaranteed minimum or maximum quantities, or dollar values. However, all purchase requirements furnished under this contract will be with the awardee, for the periods specified.

Federal penal institution, security requirements apply to this contract. This action is advertised as full and open competition. Solicitation proposal due date will be established based on actual solicitation issuance date. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation (as required under the solicitation) which shall be considered by the agency. 

The solicitation will be available on or after 01/02/2002, and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration?s Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

<DESC>The US Government is looking for sources to provide Cable TV services for 14 locations within the UK consisting of U.S. Air Force facilities at RAF Mildenhall, RAF Lakenheath, RAF Croughton, RAF Fairford, RAF Molesworth, RAF Alconbury and other facilities and US Forces housing areas. 

Currently, the Government is operating with a franchise agreement with contractor owned cable serving approximately 5700 subscribers.  A new agreement must provide for distribution of US Armed Forces Radio and Television services consisting of 13 NTSC format TV channels and 8 FM radio channels plus all local broadcast television channels to all subscribers. The provider would be allowed to provide and charge subscribers for a premium incremental tier service offering elective viewing of movie, sports, etc.  Provider would also be encouraged to offer commercial Internet service and telephone access.

Request suggestions for alternatives to the current approach for providing Cable TV Services.  Please send a letter of interest along with a description of any suggested alternatives to the 48th Contracting Squadron, Attn:  Tara Petersen, Bldg 55, Marham Road, RAF Feltwell, Thetford, Norfolk, IP26 4HL, or you can e-mail the information to tara.petersen@lakenheath.af.mil.  Request all resonses be received no later than 22 Feb 02. Questions can also be directed to Ms. Petersen at 01638 52 7201 or international 011 44 1638 52 7201.

<DESC>Sources are sought in research and development by the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Assessments and Demonstrations Division (AFRL/MNA) to develop and demonstrate common reconfigurable munitions carriage interface technologies for legacy Mil Std 1760 weapons and future Miniature Munitions Store Interface weapons. The technology will be common and applicable to the carriage platforms, dispensers, and munitions.  The reconfigurable technologies include processor, interface, and data link electronics.  These technologies will enable lower integration cost, faster fielding of systems, in field upgrading of systems and longer system life.  Payoffs include:  a) reduced weapon platform integration costs,
   
b) minimized dispenser and munitions parts obsolescent, c) backward compatible/forward configurable weapon platform interfaces and d) common avionics, dispenser and munitions reconfigurable processors.  This program will last approximately 27 months.  The effort will begin with a study phase to determine reconfigurability options.  The feasibility of a common reconfigurable card will be determined during the study phase.  Preliminary design concepts for reconfigurable processor, interface, and data link electronics will be created next.  The preliminary design will be followed by detail design, fabrication, and testing of the prototype electronics.  The prototype electronics shall be reconfigurable for backward compatibility to legacy systems and forward configurable for future systems.  Firms having applicable interests,
capability and background should submit particulars in accordance with Numbered Note 25 to AFRL/MNK, Bldg 13, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, Attn:  Bernice Bradford.

<DESC>NA The US Army CECOM Acquisition Center at Fort Monmouth, NJ is seeking potential sources that can offer the government a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Non-Developmental Item (NDI) for mobile and fixed type NIITS.  These systems will provide US government a gencies a means of non-intrusive inspection for interdicting drugs, weapons, explosives, and other contraband within various sized packages at airports, seaports, border crossings, and other ports of entry.  Each system must adhere to the requirements prov ided in the Statement of Work (SOW) in conjunction with the Inspection Checklist, including system components that operate in all types of weather conditions. The SOW and the Inspection Checklist have been posted under this solicitation number to the Inter active Business Opportunities Page (IBOP)at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/ibophome.nsf/home?open. Below are brief descriptions of each system. The mobile system must be self-contained and able to run on its own power or external power.  The system must have electric outlets available and be accessible for operators to operate an assortment of power tools and equipment.  The mobile system must be able to maneuver and operate in airport terminal environments that have size restrictions.  The system must allow packages, which have certain maximum dimensions, to enter and exit either side of the vehicle for inspection. The fixed type system, by definition, must be primarily stationary in nature allowing rapid inspection of small cargo and oversized objects to occur. The system must allow these various sized objects easy throughput for inspection. The mobile and fixed type systems must be able to penetrate various types of enclosures/packages to detect and identify each separate internal item.  Radiation exposure levels emitted from the system must fully comply with all applicable federal health and  safety regulations.  These types of radiation and other sources must be clearly identified and have appropriate sensors to identify harmful emissions. The operator's station must accommodate various operator heights for proper viewing of each monitor.  The operator must have the ability to enlarge suspected contents and view those objects under various lighting conditions.  The system must have the abili ty to store suspected images viewed by the operator on electronic media and print high-resolution pictures of images. This is a Market Survey requesting information.  Government personnel shall review the information submitted by each offeror to determine if the offeror's systems satisfy the government's requirements to conduct an on site inspection.  If the government de termines that an on site inspection is warranted, only the offeror's mobile system will be inspected.  The government reserves the right to request more information to determine the need for an inspection.  The government shall provide all interested parti es notification whether their system will require an on site inspection or does not meet the government's requirements.  Product inspection will require the offeror to demonstrate the system using test packages provided by the government team.  The governm ent shall have the right to perform an unassisted inspection of the offeror's system at the offeror's production facility or a neutral site determined by the government.  During the government's inspection, the offeror's system experts may be available to answer questions from the inspection team/assist with the inspection.   The government has the right to establish or change inspection dates and times.  Specific on site inspection dates and times will be provided after initial review of all offeror's info rmation submissions.  The anticipated timeframe for performing the on site inspections is March 2002.  Each potential offeror is cautioned that failure to have a mobile system produced by the given inspection date will be an indication of non-compliance to  the government's requirements.  There will  be no extensions granted.   Interested sources shall submit an overview of the relevant products and how they meet the government's requirements.  The offeror must also submit operating procedures, test procedures, internal/external equipment list, hardware/software configuration and  interface diagrams, maintenance times for subsystems (i.e. Mean Time Between Failure data, etc), availability, and costs.

<DESC>NA This is a SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis.  The US Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk District, is seeing business sources that have the technical capability to provide services to Aerate the Fredericksburg Canal.  The historic Fredericksburg Canal will no longer re ceive a free flow from the Rappahannock River.  Since water will no longer flow freely into the canal after the Dam is removed, the water quality in the existing historic canal in Fredericksburg VA has to be maintained.  The most promising alternative invo lves the use of an aeration/mixing system.  The upstream end of the canal will be plugged, resulting in intermittent local stormwater runoff being the sole source of water into the canal, with minor input from a perennial stream that is currently dischargi ng to the canal.  Therefore, the canal will essentially function as a long, narrow retention pond.  To keep the water in the canal from going anaerobic, it is proposed that an aeration system will be designed and installed.  The canal is located in the res idential areas of the City of  Fredericksburg VA.  It is approximately 10,500 feet in length, averages 55 feet in width along most of its length (70 feet at the most downstream end and 45 feet at the ost upstream end).  Total volume of the canal is approxi mately 2.74 million cubic feet (20.5 million gallons) at elevation 48.75.  The basic requirements are to prevent stagnation that a system be designed that will introduce continuous air into the long narrow canal.  Dissolved Oxygen requirement is 5 mg/l.  T his is NOT a request for proposals or an invitation to bid.  Interested businesses that are capable of designing and providing the required aeration system are invited to provide responses to this notice not later than 24 Feb 2002 to US Army Corps of Engin eers, Norfolk District, CENAO-SS-C (ATTN S. Hurst), 803 Front Street, Norfolk VA 23513.  Responses should demonstrate the capability to perform the work described and information concerning the aeration system that is contemplated for use.  The point of co ntact is Susan Hurst, 757-441-7747, 757-441-7183 fax, susan.i.hurst@usace.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>C -- Historic Property Preservation and Development Opportunity
<DESC>GSA Announces Historic Property Preservation and Development Opportunity


KANSAS CITY, MO - The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is looking for imaginative proposals for the preservation and development of the historic former U.S. Courthouse, located at 811 Grand in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. Designed by the local architectural firm of Wright and Wright and constructed in 1939, this nine-story Art Modern building contains 364,000 gross square feet of space providing approximately 256,000 rentable square feet of space.  The development will be based on a long-term lease of the property.  

GSA is also seeking proposals regarding the acquisition of air rights and/or sub-surface development rights for the construction of a parking garage on the government-owned surface parking lot bounded by Eighth, Ninth, McGee and Oak Streets. 

All preliminary development proposals should be consistent with required historic preservation regulations and be compatible with the overall Kansas City downtown development plan.  Responses should identify solid socio-economic benefits for the citizens of Kansas City, the Federal government and thus, the American taxpayer.  All participating parties should demonstrate any comparable prior development projects and strong financial plans for similar historic adaptive reuse projects in the future.  

On or about March 31, 2002, GSA will request Statements of Qualifications and detailed proposals from interested parties that demonstrate the capabilities to successfully complete this project.
