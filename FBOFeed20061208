<DESC>Sources are being sought from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for a company or engineering firm capable of providing full engineering support to design and possibly fabricate approximately one 180 cages in direct support of the Black Footed Ferret Recovery Program. The National Black Footed Ferret Conservation Center (NBFFCC) houses over half of the captive Black Footed Ferrets found alive today.  The health and reproductive efficiency of this population is critical to the survival and eventual recovery of these highly endangered species.  The majority of animals are housed in individual indoor cages that were designed and constructed in the late 1980's during the beginning of the recovery effort.  These plywood cages have since deteriorated and each year an ever increasing number of ferrets become sick or injured due to deteriorating cage conditions.  Although the basic design of existing cages has worked reasonably well over the past years, the Service is in need of cages made up of a more modern design with better materials. Due to the critical nature of the National Black Footed Ferreted Recovery Program, the Service is seeking innovative recommendations for cage designs. At a minimum we are looking for sources with a veterinary background with knowledge of animal behavior as well as knowledge of cage applications to fit the behavior and morphology of small mammals in long term housing in research or laboratory environments.  Firms must have (1) expertise in design and construction of cages for long term housing of small mammals in research, or laboratory environments incorporating animal enrichment considerations and ergonomics; (2) The ability to provide innovative recommendations on cage designs that meet the needs of ferrets, but will also improve the safety and efficiency of staff members caring for the animals; (3) knowledge of materials and their properties and fabrication processes. Interested design firms or other sources responding to this announcement must be able to provide references on the creativity of their design work, quality of the finished product, suitability of the final products for the intended utilization, and must have a demonstrated and have a proven track record to meet both established delivery schedules and budget parameters.  The Service understands the type of work we are seeking is specialized; therefore, designers, engineers, manufacturers, architects, etc… are encouraged to team with sub-consultants or other appropriate personnel as deemed necessary in order to respond to this announcement.  The information received in response to this announcement will be used by Government personnel to determine the most feasible way of acquiring said goods and/or services. The estimated price for design and fabrication will range between $250,000 and $500,000.00.  The selected contractor or contractors will be selected using Present and Past Performance Trade-offs (PPT) procedures resulting in the Best Value to the Government.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 332618.  The Small Business Size Standard is 500 Employees.   Interested offerors shall provide a capability profile which consists of an introduction statement, company structure, and must be able to provide references on the creativity of their design work, quality of your finished product, suitability of the final product for the intended utilization, and prove that they have demonstrated and a proven track record in meeting established delivery schedules and budget parameters.  Please provide as much detail as possible.  Please provide information as to the size and status of your company, i.e., Hubzone, 8(a), Service- Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, Small Business Concerns, etc…. If you are interested in this project and are confident you can satisfy the requirements of this announcement, please submit a written response to this announcement.

<ARCHDATE>01232007
<CONTACT>Erin Durand 7034324156
<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to award a one time sole source firm-fixed price contract to Crossroads Industrial Services, 8302 East 33rd Street, Indianapolis, IN 46226 for the procurement of Combat Identification Panels (CIPs) for 721 Marine Corps-specific vehicles for Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs).  The total estimated cost of this acquisition is $700,000. CIPs have improved combat effectiveness and reduced incidents of fratricide by providing the means to positively identify friendly ground forces on the battlefield.  The Combat Identification Panels provided by Crossroads Industrial are currently the joint solution being used by deployed ground forces. It is necessary that all vehicles used by the MEUS be equipped with the same functional capability and similar Combat Identification design as all other currently deployed equipment, so that procedures associated with installing, maintaining, repairing, and combat employment remain the same.  Each CIP acts as a thermal reflective marker and is designed to fit on a specific vehicle. When viewed through a thermal imaging system, the panels appear as contrasting cold spots on a hot target image.  In the engagement process, gunners rely upon this contrasting signature to determine if the targeted vehicle is friendly or unknown.  The desert tan colored aluminum panels are of varyin!  g sizes and are either flat or louvered, depending on their placement on the vehicle.  One side of each panel is covered with U.S. Army-approved low-emissivity thermal tape and does not require an external power source for effective operation.  This solution is both durable and survivable in harsh environmental and operational conditions.   Crossroads Industrial Services is the sole-source designer, manufacturer, and supplier of these CIPs for the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps.  The Marine Corps vehicles for which these CIPS are strategically designed are: the Light Assault Vehicle-25mm variant (LAV-25), Light Assault Vehicle-Logistics variant (LAV-L), Mobile Electronic Warfare Support System (MEWSS), Advance Man-Portable Air Defense System (AMANPADS), Interim Fast Attack Vehicles (IFAVs), and all Assault Amphibious Vehicles (AAV) and Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) cargo truck variants. No Request for Proposal (RFP) is available, however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability, in writing, for satisfying this requirement no later than close of business on 23 January, 2007 to the contact person listed above.  Numbered Note 22 applies to this acquisition.

Technology gained under this contract will be used by NIAID to manufacture HIV vaccines to be used in human clinical trials, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.  GenVec (Gaithersburg, MD) has been identified as the only responsible sole source for this procurement.  GenVec is the source of a proprietary packaging cell line (293-ORF6) that has a demonstrated safety profile in the production of adenoviral vectors for use in human clinical trials.  In addition, product produced by GenVec has been used in previous clinical trials and is scheduled to be used in an upcoming Phase II trial.  Regulatory requirements indicate that the material for later phase clinical trials must be produced in the same cell line as that used for the initial studies, or the trials will likely need to be repeated at a substantial cost to the government.  Switching to a different packaging cell line or manufacturing technology would require a repeat of a substantial number of previously conducted pre-clinical and clinical studies at a significant and unnecessary duplicative cost to the government.  It is anticipated that any award issued from this solicitation will be a combination firm-fixed and cost reimbursement type contract.  Requests for information or questions concerning this requirement must be submitted in writing, and can be directed to LaDonna Stewart at ladonna_steawart@nih.gov by May 4, 2006.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement to purchase the (77776-026) PAXgene Blood RNA tubes from VWR International 1050 Satelite Boulevard, Suwanee, GA 30021.  These items are to be used to conduct NICHD approved protocols of the Perinatology Research Branch. The PAXgene Blood RNA System is a revolutionary, enabling technology that consolidates and integrates the key steps of whole blood collection, nucleic add stabilization, and RNA purification. By minimizing the unpredictability associated with RNA processing, the system provides enhanced accuracy of intracellular RNA analysis. We have utilized this unique technology in our clinical research protocols. Changing the vendor in the middle of the? research project will make our data useless since we will not be able 10 compare the results obtained from all of our previous assays
All responsible businesses that are capable of providing the Government with the items that are listed above may request a copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ) in writing or by FAX to 301-480-8501 to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement to procure the services of Seu Lain L Chen, Potomac, MD 20854.  Ms. Chen would be responsible for The Referral and Program. Analysis Branch (RPAB) serves as the NICHD's office for scientific programmatic assignment of scientific research grants, contracts and intramural projects; for developing and maintaining the official scientific, administrative and fiscal database; and for analyzing and reporting on the Institute's scientific/administrative research programs. The Branch and its scientific staff are responsible for the scientific coding and updating of the Child Health Information Retrieval (CHIRP) system. The Branch uses this and other data bases to support NICHD's decision making and to respond to ad hoc inquires from governmental officials, congress and the public concerning the Institute's scientific portfolio. Given the importance of this work, and the increasing number of requests, it is critical that the Branch maintain the accuracy, quality and quantity of its work. Several years ago, RP AB had to contend with the retirement of two very senior staff members. Due to the ongoing and pressing workloads in the Branch, and the shortage of permanent NICHD full time employees (FTEs) to address that issue, and the need for trained scientist to complete RPAB functions, the Branch has turned to Ms. to complete these duties under contract. We are requesting 1,020 hours to help in the completion of the duties of indexing funded RPAB grants, contracts and intramural projects, to complete reports for several aspects of the federally mandated Moyer report.  Specifically the requirements will be to code the scientific data for the funded projects in the MRDD, PCCR, BSRT, BSCD, SMAD, TSR and CP branches into the new CHIRP database; indexing and retrieval of information for these branches over the last three years. Additional coding for other branches may be required as needed;  scientific programmatic assignment to the individual branches and initial coding of all applications in assigned;  finla1ize in the previous year in several disease/disorders categories (the Moyer Report and subsequent requests for information). Interest areas included Agent Orange, Aging Research, Alcoholism, Alzheimer's Disease, Assertive Technology, Bioengineering, Muscular Dystrophy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Hepatitis-C, Homelessness, Hypertension, Influenza, Malaria, Malaria Vaccine, Mucopolysaccharidoses, Myasthenia Gravis, Organ Transplant, Osteoporosis, Organ Transplant, Otitis Media, Parkinson's Disease, Rural Health, Sickle Cell Disease, Spinal Cord Injury, TMJ, Tourette's Syndrome, Transplant Research, and she completed a new, very extensive report on Tissue Engineering. Ms. Chen is also asked to prepare ad hoc reports as assigned; the special assignment of reporting Minority Health for the Institute; use of the CHIRP database for coding and report any errors that may occur or report needed enhancements to Universal High Tech Development (UHD, developers of the CHIRP data base).  Ms. Chen is the ideal candidate for the duties of indexing the NICHD grants, contract, and intramural projects and preparing reports, as noted above, since she was a recent employee of the Branch before her retirement and has extensive scientific knowledge in her area of expertise. Ms. Chen was one of the original interactive staff members in the design of the CHIRP database. She also had experience in the design of the web-based CRISP database before coming to RP AB. She has the experience and knowledge to complete the duties required, without having to learn the complicated RP AB coding system, with its 17 different conceptual axis and 600 different codes, or the ongoing CHIRP database, which she helped to develop. She has reported disease topics for the Moyer report in the past, she is the office expert for Minority Health reporting and she is familiar with the criteria for the individual searches. Her efficiency and expertise cannot be matched, especially in a position where extreme accuracy and familiarity with the scientific content are demanded. She has reported disease topics for the Moyer report in the past and is familiar with the criteria for the individual searches. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all responses received, before the closing date, of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation (RFQ) NIH-NIDDK-07-109 will be available fifteen (15) days after the release of the RFQ.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is January 2, 2007.  Request for copies of the RFQ must be in writing to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Two Democracy Plaza, Room 774B, Bethesda, MD 20817 Attention: V. Lynn Griffin.  FAX quotations must contain offerors name, address, telephone number and fax number.  FAX quotations will be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Amendment 2 follows: This is the second amendment to AFTIL Market Survey. 1.  The following changes should be made, pen and ink, to Paragraph 9 of the Draft Statement of Work:      a) The abbreviation (SME) is deleted from the Computer Aided Design (CAD) and 3D Real-Time Modeling Specialist labor category;      b) AT Specialist (AA):  is corrected to read AT Specialist: and      c) The Administrative Assistant labor category is deleted. 2.  There were several questions posed regarding the predecessor contract. Question:  Who was the contractor and are they eligible to compete?   Answer:  The contract was awarded to Joseph Sheairs Associates.  This SEDB firm subsequently became part of L-3 Ilex.  As such, they are a large business and no longer a viable competitor if the FAA sets this aside for SEDBs or for any small business category. Question:  Are the current employees available as part of any potential transition? Answer:  Arrangements between employees and their employers is on a free will basis.  The FAA is not able to speak to the current employees' availability. Question:  What was the contract number, start date, expiration date and value? The Contract # was DTFA03-00-D-00022, Delivery Order 0002.  The Delivery Order started in February, 2001 and is scheduled to expire in June, 2007.  The total dollars obligated to date are $6,977,759.37; however, this order also covered work for Flight Support Services (FSS).  FSS was recently re-competed and awarded as a separate contract and is not included in the current SOW.  It is estimated that 35% of the funding on Delivery Order 0002 was used for FSS. Question:  When do you expect to award the follow-on contract? Answer:  This is a market survey/sources sought announcement, with the single purpose of discovering the capable competition available in the SEDB and SDVOSB business community. Timelines for the follow-on contract have not been established.  3.  Question:  Our firm has experience in the tools mentioned but we do not have expertise related specifically to FAA or its operational needs.  Is this knowledge of FAA component essential?   Answer:  Demonstration of the requisite corporate experience in the tools is essential, regardless of whether the work environment was FAA, NASA, military, commercial customer, etc.  4.  Amendment 1 requested that SDVOSB firms include a certifying letter from the Small Business Administration.  This is not required.  However, SDVOSBs can establish their eligibility to compete in this category by either providing:   A letter from their local Veterans Administration (VA) showing that the owner is a service connected disabled veteran with a rated disability; or   A copy of the rating letter received from the VA or the military service awarding the rating after redacting the percentage, reason for the rating or other person information not necessary for the certification. 5.  A request was made to change the North American Industry Code Standard.  Upon review, the FAA is satisfied that the Engineering Services, 541330, is appropriate for the work contemplated. -------------End of Amendment 2----------------------------------- The market survey is hereby expanded to include Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  SDVOSBs possessing the requisite capabilities to accomplish the tasks in the SOW work are invited to respond by 2 p.m. local time on December 12, 2006 and shall provide all items requested in the original announcement, including a copy of a letter from the Small Business Administration certifying their status as an SDVOSB.   The due date for submissions from SEDB/8(a) firms is unchanged, i.e. due by 2 p.m., local time, December 6, 2006. All submissions shall be delivered to: 	Federal Aviation Administration  	William J. Hughes Technical Center 	Engineering Services Acquisition Sub-Team (AJP-7551) 	Attn:  P. Schlegel 	Atlantic City International Airport, NJ 08405 Submissions shall be marked "AFTIL Market Survey Responses" and must include one (1) original and three (3) copies.   --------------End of Amendment-------------------------------------------- This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.2.4.  It is a survey, not a solicitation, to determine interest and capabilities of interested Small Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB).  A predecessor contract, #DTFA03-00-D-00022, Delivery Order 0002, was originally awarded to a SEDB firm.  The FAA has an ongoing need for some, but not all, of the tasks that were in this order.  This market survey is being conducted to aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside competition to SEDBs.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. The North American Industry Code Standard for the work comtemplated is 541330, Engineering Services.  The size standard is $4.5 million. A draft Statement of Work for Airport Facilities Terminal Integration Laboratory (AFTIL) support services is attached.  The FAA has a need for these requirements for the next five years. Interested companies are required to provide: -A copy of a letter from the Small Business Administratin certifying their status as a SEDB/8(a) firm. -Completed Business Declaration Form, (attached) -A capability summary of not more than 8 pages that addresses corporate capabilities specific to accomplish this work and transition of existing contract in a seamless manner.  The summary should include information on how contractor personnel will be supplied, i.e., currently available as employees of the prime, subcontractor arrangements, etc. Submission of these items is requested by 2 p.m. local time on December 6, 2006.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of responses to this announcement.  Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities.  Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is a sources sought announcement so no solicitation exists; please do not request one.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page and it is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for release.  If a determination to set this requirement aside for SEDBs is made, failure to respond to this announcement may result in exclusion of offeror from completition since the competition may be released to qualified, responding SEDBs. Inquiries relative to this announcement are to be submitted in writing only via e-mail to Phyliss.Schlegel @faa.gov.

Automated litigation support encompasses a wide range of professional services and products that help attorneys acquire, organize, develop, and present evidence throughout the course of litigation, from pre-filing investigation, through complaint, discovery, and trial, through post-trial briefs and the appeals process.  DOJ has well-established ALS programs in place in the Civil Division, the Civil Rights Division, the Criminal Division, the Antitrust Division, the Environment and Natural Resources Division, the Executive Office for U. S. Attorneys, and the Tax Division.  Much of the work in these programs is performed by ALS contractors under ALS contracts awarded, administered, and monitored by DOJ.  The primary purpose of this quality assurance contract will be to:  (1) ensure that ALS Contractor deliverables are in compliance with ALS Contract specifications; and, (2) provide the basis for Government acceptance or rejection of ALS Contractor deliverables, in accordance with Contract specifications and requirements.  Contractor personnel will furnish administrative, logistical, professional, and technical labor, supplies, equipment, facilities, materials, and technologies necessary to provide a wide range of quality assurance services through the course of litigation.  Key quality assurance objectives as they relate to litigation support include the following: 1) screening for imaging/photocopying; 2) image capture, including digital image scanning; 3) blowback/photocopying; 4) screening for coding; 5) document coding; 6) data capture, including keying and optical character recognition; 7) database integrity; 8) data accuracy; 9) documentation (case manuals, procedures, and instructions); 10) training sessions; 11) database corrections; 12) electronic file processing, including E-Discovery; 13) web-based databases; 14) specialized areas; and 15) litigation support processes.  The Government will award one indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for this requirement.  It is anticipated that the contract will be for one (1) base year and five (5) option periods of one year each.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541199 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  The solicitation will be available on or about January 29, 2007.  Due date for receipt of proposals will be approximately thirty-five (35) days after issuance of the solicitation.  All information regarding this procurement, including the solicitation document and amendments, will only be made available electronically on the General Service Administration?s ?Federal Business Opportunities? web site, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

 Specifically, the Federal Election Commission (FEC or Commission) has been receiving campaign finance filings in electronic form since 1997. Congress has mandated that all committees that must file reports directly with the FEC and that reach certain activity thresholds must file electronically beginning with activity covering 2001.  Committees meeting these criteria have been filing electronically since that time.  The Commission has contracted to develop and operate an electronic filing system and to support other related information storage and retrieval requirements due to an increasing level of filings, with higher participation during election years. Additionally, systems have been established to provide online disclosure of enforcement activities for completed cases.  There is an incumbent currently providing these services.

Program Executive Officer, Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation (PEO(W)), PMA-263 (U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems) is the acquisition Program Manager for this potential effort.

The STUAS/Tier II UAS will provide persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) support for tactical level maneuver decisions and unit level force defense/force protection for Naval ships (multi-ship classes) and Marine Corps land forces. A notional system may include three air vehicles, one ground control station, multi-mission (plug & play) payloads, and associated launch, recovery, and support equipment. This system will support Naval missions such as building the Recognized Maritime Picture, Maritime Security Operations, Maritime Interdiction Operations, and support of Naval units operating from sea/shore in the global war on terrorism. This system will also support Marine Corps missions such as close range UAS enabling enhanced decision-making and improved integration with ground schemes of maneuver.  The draft STUAS/Tier II UAS Concept of Operations (CONOPS) is available upon request via CD-ROM to US DoD Contractors only.  To request the CONOPS, email your company name, address, CAGE code, and point of contact information (name, phone number and email address) to: Ms. Kelly Chism at Kelly.chism@navy.mil. The CD-ROM will be mailed upon verification of requestor?s information.

<DESC>The service provider shall provide the necessary products and services to accomplish all of the requirements stated herein.
The Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) in the Department of State seeks to institute a credit and/or debit card based system to manage its obligation for providing diplomatic tax-relief privileges for foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations and their members throughout the United States.  This new system will be referred to as the Diplomatic Tax-Exempt Credit/Debit (TECD) Program.    

OFM seeks from the private sector proposals for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges initiated through the use of a provider issued ?tax-exempt? credit and/or debit card to foreign missions, international organizations and their eligible personnel.  ?Tax-Exempt? means vendors should exempt or remove charges associated with most taxes on purchases made using such cards.  The U.S. government will not underwrite or assume any liability for these credit/debit cards, and also will not guarantee payment of the debts on these credit cards. All risk in extending credit will fall on the credit issuer.  

OFM hopes to eventually provide diplomatic tax-relief privileges solely through a credit/debit card-based system.  However, it accepts that technological and programmatic issues stand as current obstacles to achieving this vision.   Therefore, this credit/debit card will serve as one of two systems that OFM will make available to the foreign mission and international organization community for obtaining diplomatic tax.  OFM estimates that such credit/debit cards will be used frequently and will likely have a higher average use-rate in comparison to those issued to average consumers.  

The tax-exemption identification cards that OFM currently produces will continue to exist as an option for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges.  However, the option to use the existing system will only be available to certain individuals.  Therefore, the majority of the diplomatic and international community will receive their tax-relief benefits through the TECD Program.  Each mission/organization will have the option of using either the existing tax-exemption identification card system or the new TECD Program.  In the event the selected bank is unable to provide services to a mission/organization or their members, they will be able to use the existing system.   

There are roughly 9,000 diplomatic tax-exemption cards currently circulating throughout the United States.  

The provision of this service will attract the operating accounts of many foreign missions and international organizations as well as their members to the bank selected for this program.  Therefore, service providers stand to generate new revenues not only from providing this system, but also through the added customer and deposit base that goes along with providing banking services to such account holders.  

As a point of reference concerning the credit worthiness of foreign missions and their members, in conjunction with participating oil companies, OFM has provided ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards to foreign missions and diplomats since the mid-1980s.  Although, the tax-relief mechanism used with this card is vastly different from the one described in this document, the extension and management of credit to foreign missions and their members is basically identical.   Over the past 20 years, the service providers of the ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards have reported extremely few problems concerning foreign missions or their members as routinely delinquent or unable to pay balances on such accounts.  A list of the oil companies that participate in the ?tax-exempt gasoline credit card program can be viewed on the OFM website at www.state.gov/ofm/tax/gasoline/24625.htm.  

OFM will permit the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to participate in the TECD program to facilitate its responsibility to provide tax-relief privileges to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) and its members.  These privileges are established under the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.   AIT will serve most of the roles/responsibilities identified for OFM in this document.  

This solicitation not only offers the opportunity for service providers to present a solution to OFM?s business process needs for a credit and/or debit card based diplomatic tax relief program, but to propose added services that might realize the Department of State?s vision of electronic and streamlined government business processes, both domestically and abroad.

Currently, OFM plans to offer this opportunity to all service providers capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.   

Background of the Diplomatic Tax Exemption Process:
The Foreign Missions Act of 1982 (22 USC 4301-4316) requires that OFM manage the U.S. Government?s provision of certain diplomatic privileges on the basis of reciprocity.  The U.S. Government?s obligation to provide diplomatic tax relief is primarily a result of both the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  However, this privilege is also an obligation of various other bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements, such as the United Nations Headquarters? Agreement. 

The authority to authorize TECRO and its members for tax-relief privileges is an obligation of AIT in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.      

Due to the reciprocity requirement in the Foreign Missions Act, OFM is required to provide foreign missions with diplomatic tax relief privileges to the extent that each counterpart foreign government provides such relief to the U.S. diplomatic mission and its members.  Therefore, OFM limits or denies tax exemption to missions that limit or deny tax relief to U. S. diplomatic representatives in the host countr

<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only one responsible source  and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This agency intends to award to The Council of State Governments, 2760 Research Park Dr, Lexington KY 40511-8410


Prior to USCENTCOM initiating action to procure the required support for this seminar, research was completed to determine if other disaster management subject matter experts with the same skill sets were available and willing to do work in the Horn of Africa.  The only organization accredited to evaluate Disaster Management Programs is EMAP.  EMAP has been contracted to conduct evaluations of all 50 states.  The “EMAP Standard” is a set of comprehensive standards that can be applied to an emergency management program of any size; national-level governments are not an exception. Components of the standard address emergency preparedness, response, and recovery from terrorist acts, natural disasters, and other catastrophic incidents. 

EMAP is ideally suited to conduct training on emergency management doctrine for foreign professionals. Since the EMAP Commission was seated in 2002, EMAP has trained more than 300 state and local emergency management professionals to be peer assessors and conducted on-site assessments in approximately 60 state and local jurisdictions. There are more than 675 registered users of the EMAP Online Assessment Tool from the United States and other countries. 
  The EMAP program is a voluntary assessment accreditation process for state/territorial, tribal and local government emergency management programs.  There is no other organization at this time that provides the following:

	Evaluation of a jurisdictions’ emergency preparedness and response system against published national standards
	Structure for identifying areas in need of improvement and benchmarking progress; 
	Means to prioritize resources and demonstrate accountability to the public and elected officials
	Catalyst for improved interoperability and continuity
	Mechanism for sharing best practices among emergency management professionals.

Include EO/IR/I2/LD/LRF RFI in the subject line and one (1) hard copy to PM NV/RSTA, ATTN: Janet  Boots, 10221 Burbeck Road, Fort Belvoir VA 22060-5806. 4.  PM NV/RSTA is conducting a market survey in part to identify sources and in part to permit a feasibility assessment for the production of the Electro-Optic/Infrared/Image Intensified sensor system with laser designator and laser rangefinder capability to include technical risks and existing/potential solutions, acquisition risks, candidate procurement and support strategies, and industry interest.   This includes the possibility of Full Rate Production.  This sensor has been given the tentative name of Common Sensor System. This is not a System Development and Demonstration program.   The Government is issuing this RFI to obtain information from industry which would permit a feasibility assessment of achieving the Common Sensor capability within the incr ement structure and timeframe stated and to assist the Government in determining the best acquisition strategy for accomplishing this objective. The information provided in response to this market survey will be used to support updating the acquisition str ategy developed for the Common Sensor System program and to justify any modifications required to any current program.  Government objectives are:  a. A low cost common sensor for airborne platforms.     (1) Common operational capability     (2) Common logistics support structure that reduces Operations & Support (O&S) costs.  b. Initial Common Capability     (1) Rapid (schedule)     (2) Low Risk for integration     (3) Minimizes up front development  c. Allows for clear path for added capabilities in the near term and new capabilities/technologies in the future. 5. This sensor shall be capable of being integrated into the Extended Range Multi-Purpose Unmanned Aircraft System and the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter.  The Electro Optic/Infrared/Image Intensified/Laser Designator/Laser Rangefinder (EO/IR/I2/LD/LRF) s ystem will provide a battlefield commander with overall mission area support to perform tactical level reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition and attack throughout the full spectrum of Army and Joint operations.  The EO/IR/I2/LD/LRF is a day/n ight imaging sensor that is capable of providing continuous, fully focused, near real time imagery and the ability to accurately range and designate for precision guided munitions and reporting of target locations. The sensor system will be required to mee t the threshold requirements outlined in paragraph 7.   6. Scope of Effort: The government desi res to enter an Initial Production phase for the Increment 1 capability sensor system with the increment 2 capability to be added in FY09. The entirety of Increment 1 and Increment 2 represents the threshold capability that is required.  A Fixed Price/Cost  hybrid type contract is anticipated for the initial production phase and includes 5 production options for additional quantities.   The projected contract award date is 30 April 2007.   Deliveries of systems shall commence within 9 months of contract awar d with a goal of within 6 months.  Air vehicle integration on first units will be completed within 1-2 months of delivery.  The initial production contract will also include a full supportability performance based logistics and MANPRINT program to include,  but not limited to, the development of technical data in both hardcopy and IETM/w parts list and maintenance allocation chart, maintenance plans, training packages, test support package to include spares, repair parts, and any special tools/test equipment .  Full Production Profile:   The following production profile is anticipated for the systems: FY09:100 Units, FY10:102 Units, FY11: 120 Units, FY12: 114 Units, FY13: 113 Units, FY14: 63 Units.  Qualified vendors should have an existing product meeting per formance requirements and have sufficient production capacity to meet production quantities as stated.  The response should have a short introductory description of the approach to be taken, technical description of the proposed system/technologies to be e mployed, how this approach meets the anticipated requirements and suggested ways that the government could reduce cost, schedule and risk.  Additional documentation such as formal test results and assessments from a government test agency, product descript ions, previous performance, may be appended. 7.  Key aspects for the Common Sensor System include:  a.

<SUBJECT>T -- Notice of Intent to Award
<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This agency intends to award to United Press International International, 1510 H Street NW, Washington DC 20005-2208

The United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) Directorate of Intelligence (CCJ2) requests the purchase of United Press International Wire Service to support United States Central Command Intelligence Analysts dissecting and analyzing data on current and political events and key figures in the USCENTCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR). The Directorate requires a news wire service subscription with unlimited licensing to allow for the widest dissemination of information to intelligence analysts to facilitate situational awareness and fill gaps in reporting from other wire services currently being used within the directorate. This acquisition is an ?add on? to existing news wire subscriptions currently maintained by USCENTCOM.  This additional subscription will aid in obtaining depth and breadth of all available news casts from the diversified agencies that collect and provide the information.  This requirement will have a Period of Performance not to exceed one year form the date it is awarded.  This action is to renew the wire service contract, which can only be provided by United Press International.

UPI is an additional news service that provides unlimited licensing with a subscription to the service. This unique feature guarantees the widest distribution of current information is available to intelligence analysts, and facilitates situational awareness that will directly contribute to existing Force Protection afforded by other news wire subscriptions in the USCENTCOM AOR. Extensive access to UPI wire service over the past 6 years has proven effective in augmenting other wire services. 

Market research was conducted through internet product searches and through past history of using other similar products, all of which provide unlimited number of licenses per subscription. However, there is a need to ensure the widest method of information collection is obtained and limiting the gathering and reporting of information via only one contractor who provides news wire subscription, increases the possibility of missing the opportunity to gather all viable news collection and dissemination of information to the directorate.

<SUBJECT>--Market Survey NAC-2007-01 Reliability and Safety Center Feasibility
<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a r equest seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on informat ion requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT: TARDEC is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources  with the expertise necessary to manage and execute a program/center in modeling and simulation(M&S) to research and develop methodologies which will predict the reliability of military gro und vehicles during both the design stage and throughout its life-cycle.  The Army needs the capability to rapidly analyze the design of systems of varying complexity in order to predict and model the multi-physics reliability for the system during its pro jected life. The Government is looking for methodology and modeling tools (proposed or developed) to accurately predict reliability utilizing multi-physics and multi-scale methodologies.  Responses must address Issues of uncertainty or variability in manuf acturing, materials, maintenance history, storage and usage history as it relates to the following objectives.  Each response is expected to demonstrate and clearly document prior experience, especially industry and government experience, for at least 5 of  the objectives listed.  Responses that do not clearly address at least 5 or more of the objectives will not be considered.  The objectives are as follows: (1)  Multi-scale Metal Component Reliability Objective:  Demonstrate expertise and knowledge of multi-scale internal state variable models that include statistical variations from the material microstructure of lightweight alloys like magnesium, aluminum, and ultra-light high strength steel, which wi ll also incorporate studies of fatigue and fracture initiation and growth.  (2) Multi-scale Biomechanics Reliability Model  Objective:  Demonstrate expertise to provide a whole body finite element mesh in which each system (muscle, tendon/ligaments, organs, etc) is independently meshed and then integrated systems together.  The model will not only bridge the various systems but  the multi-scale aspects of each system, for example, tendon, muscle, brain, cartilage, skin, and bone, and input the results into a finite element code for analysis of high impact testing.  Another goal is to implement the results into the development of biologically inspired engineering materials.  (3) Structural Composite Design and Reliability Objective:  Demonstrate expertise to provide models for nanoparticle-reinforced composite systems for structural and electrical applications that will predict reliability of same  (4) Joint/fastener and Systems Reliability Objective:  Demonstrate expertise to provide models to determine the reliability of joint components and of corresponding systems for structural applications  (5) Simulation-Based Design Optimization and Reliability Assessment Objective: Demonstrate expertise to provide simulation-based design optimization/reliability assessment methods and tools that can capitalize on multi-scale physics-based material models for probabilistic design of lightweight automotive structures.  (6) Metallic Component & System Integration Objective: Demonstrate expertise to provide math-based, experimentally-validated powder compaction and sinter models.  (7) Human & Systems Integration Objective: Demonstrate expertise to provide or propose new reliability-based ergonomicall y evaluated vehicular components incorporating CAD/CAM/CAE Virtual Development Design Tools, Body Design and Engineering, Design Optimization, and Human Factors  with weighted factors related to seating, vision and visibility, comfort, mobility, telematic s and uncertainty.  (8) High Performance Computing Incorporating Multi-scale, Multilevel, Physics-Based Reliability Models (computational efficiency) Objective: Demonstrate expertise to develop methods for improved computational efficiency in the multidisciplinary design optimizations. These should make use of High Performance Computing (HPC).  (9)  Cyber infrastructure Objective: Demonstrate expertise to develop cyber infrastructure supporting the development and utilization of multi-scale, multilevel, multidisciplinary design optimizations and reliability assessment.  (10) Sensor and Networking for Field Applications Objective: Demonstrate expertise to develop an integrated system-of-systems approach to create a reliable, efficient, and transparent in-field communications system comprising power-supply, sensors and networks, necessary to provide an immediately availabl e multi-node data query, data analysis and data transfer system for vehicles.  RESPONSES DUE Responses to the Market Survey are due by January 8, 2007 and should be no more than 25 pages of text. RESPONSE FORMAT(S): ELECTRONIC:  Electronic responses are preferred and strongly encouraged.  It is requested that electronic responses be provided in any of the following formats:  Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power Point.  The maximum size of each e-mail sh ould be not more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes.  You may use multiple e-mail messages.  The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3 etc., as well as [Organization Name].  All interested entities *e.g. companies, non-profit organi zations, and academic institutes), regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Please submit electronic responses and any questions prior to full response to Thomas Udvare via email at udvaret@tacom.army.mil.  Please for mat the subject line of the response email as follows; [Organization Name] response to NAC-2007-01.   GENERAL INFORMATION: The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. §1905 to protect information qualifying as CONFIDENTIAL under this statute.  Pursuant to thi s statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:         1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protec ted.       2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of          your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected      3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data,        4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by ph ysical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS.      5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.      6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as Confidential will prec lude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.

<DESC>Background:
The Office of Public Information is actively involved in responding to the 1987 Congressional mandate ?...to develop outreach programs aimed at the transfer of the latest scientific findings to all health professionals...in rural communities and other areas, and, to publicize the availability of its products and services...?  In response to this charge, the National Library of Medicine?s (NLM) Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) would like to acquire the services of a contractor to assist in the overall coordination of NLM?s NEWSLINE quarterly production.  All articles for the publication are intended to be of primary interest to the public, broadly defined, to include not only consumers, but the library community, health professionals, and the scientific community.  

Purpose and Task Description:
The purpose of this procurement is to promote NLM?s work and activities to NLM employees, the public, health professionals, and the scientific community.  Particularly, NLM has identified the need for a contractor to assist in the overall coordination of two (2) issues of the NLM Newsline magazine?s quarterly production.   The NLM OCPL staff will be responsible for identifying topics to be researched and drafted by the contractor.  The contractor will be responsible for gathering the materials to develop the content for the publication and ultimately authoring all of the articles.   NLM staff shall review all content for accuracy and approve all articles for publication.  The magazine, on average, runs about 24 pages and averages between 20 and 30 articles.  The estimated number of labor hours for two (2) issues is 1000.  The expected period of performance is from the date of award to September 29, 2007. Specifically, the NLM is seeking the assistance of a contractor to:     

1)	Coordinate the production of the NLM Newsline Magazine with the production of the NIHMedlinePlus magazine.  This is intended to provide for the consideration and potential transfer of content solutions identified in the production of the NIHMedlinePlus magazine.  Ideally, such solutions should enhance and improve the overall appearance, readability, and usability of the magazine?s content for the public;
2)	Research, draft, revise, and prepare articles, in consultation with NLM staff, for publication in the quarterly issues of the Newsline magazine;
3)	Coordinate the development, drafting, revision, technical review, fact-checking, approval, and submission of articles for publication;
4)	Prepare for moderating twice-weekly conference call meetings of NLM OCPL staff, and contractors involved in producing the magazine.  It is not expected that all meetings with OCPL staff and other contractors in preparing articles for NLM NEWSLINE magazine can be conducted by phone or email.  Contractor should budget for travel to the NLM campus approximately once a month;
5)	Act as a liaison between contract writers (any subcontractors hired by the contractor), information sources, NLM staff and others (including design contractor and printer) to ensure the efficient review, revision and approval of editorial material; and 
6)	Contribute to ongoing editorial and design oversight (working with NLM?s graphic design artists in developing the layout for the content) to ensure the highest quality publication.    Contractor is not expected to provide camera-ready copy for the printed version of the publication, or to layout each issue.  Materials are to be submitted in electronic form and shipped to NLM design and print contractors.

Previous issues of the publication that are available online do not constitute a reasonable basis for estimating the nature and level of services and activities that will be requested of a contractor. The NLM is seeking innovative and effective approaches for responding to the proposal, encouraging appropriate innovations in focus, style and direction.

Evaluation Factors

 Selection of an offeror for award will be based on an evaluation of responses against 1) technical factors, and 2) cost/price.  The following technical evaluation criteria below are listed in relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes.

Technical Merit.  Quality and clarity of approach to accomplish the objectives of this statement of work. Evidence of work of a similar nature and of ability to accomplish milestones within the time frame. (50 points)

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Fleet Readiness Center Jacksonville, FL has a requirement for application of a sermetal coating to return to ready for use condition for various J52 engine parts, primarily stators.  The contract action will be a modification adding approximately 1,173 parts to be coated over the next two years to an existing contract with Sermatech in Biddleford, Maine. The coating must be consistent with the coating on the other engine parts and stators, as these parts can be intermingled within the same engine.  The Government does not have the technical data and specialized parts required to be disseminated for a competition, and the only known source of this specific coating is Sermatech in Biddleford, Maine, therefore this procurement will be pursued as a sole source acquisition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.  As this will be a contract modification, no additional written solicitation will be issued. All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the Agency. This procurement will be conducted under FAR 13.5 Commercial Item Test Program.

Statement of Work, Background The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL) recently described a framework and implementation plans for ecological effects research on aquatic stressors.   One goal of this research is to develop stressor-response relationships and models linking habitat alteration and loss to responses in bay scallop (Argopecten irradians) populations.  The Atlantic Ecology Division (AED) is developing these models for the bay scallop and needs data on bay scallop abundance and recruitment and the habitats associated with this species. Nantucket Harbor in Nantucket, MA has one of the only remaining healthy and well managed population of bay scallops on the east coast of the U.S. and is the ideal location to examine these organism/habitat relationships. The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, and equipment to conduct dive surveys at 48 sites within Nantucket Harbor on two separate occasions - once in summer and fall 2007 for a total of 96 sampling events.   In addition, the contractor shall measure juvenile scallop abundance via settlement into spat bags and collect water samples for chlorophyll measurements.  The EPA will provide the contractor with the location (latitude and longitude in the form of Global Positioning system (GPS) coordinates) of the sampling sites within Nantucket Harbor upon contract award. The contractor shall conduct dive surveys at each location and record the abundance and size of bay scallops, the abundance and size of associated predators, and record basic habitat information.  The habitat data to be provided are as follows: Presence/absence of eelgrass, Canopy height of eelgrass, Eelgrass density estimate (such as percent cover or shoot density), Presence/absence of macroalgae, Sediment type, Water depth, Turbidity/seston estimates, Dissolved oxygen, Water temperature, Salinity, Water pH, Sediments samples - to be delivered to EPA, AED for subsequent grain size analysis. The contractor shall collect the data for all parameters listed above.  The same locations shall be sampled in both summer (July) and fall (September-October) 2007 with 25 m diver transects. The contractor shall get estimates of bay scallop juveniles via the use of spat bags (mesh bags containing monofilament) within the harbor during the summer to fall months (July- September 2007).  Spat bags will be located in the same areas as the dive surveys. A Quality Management Plan/Quality Assurance Project Plan that includes survey methods shall be provided and approved by AED?s Quality Assurance Officer prior to sampling (June 2007).  The EPA will provide a format for the report upon contract award. Data from the dive surveys and spat bags shall be entered into an Excel (Microsoft Excel) database ready for statistical analysis by AED.

the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity
as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
 (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C.

control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall

(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some internal forums.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is for Scallop and Habitat Surveys and is for FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical  Services.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-07-10074, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.   A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. Statement of Work, Background The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL) recently described a framework and implementation plans for ecological effects research on aquatic stressors.   One goal of this research is to develop stressor-response relationships and models linking habitat alteration and loss to responses in bay scallop (Argopecten irradians) populations.  The Atlantic Ecology Division (AED) is developing these models for the bay scallop and needs data on bay scallop abundance and recruitment and the habitats associated with this species. Nantucket Harbor in Nantucket, MA has one of the only remaining healthy and well managed population of bay scallops on the east coast of the U.S. and is the ideal location to examine these organism/habitat relationships. The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, and equipment to conduct dive surveys at 48 sites within Nantucket Harbor on two separate occasions - once in summer and fall 2007 for a total of 96 sampling events.   In addition, the contractor shall measure juvenile scallop abundance via settlement into spat bags and collect water samples for chlorophyll measurements.  The EPA will provide the contractor with the location (latitude and longitude in the form of Global Positioning system (GPS) coordinates) of the sampling sites within Nantucket Harbor upon contract award. The contractor shall conduct dive surveys at each location and record the abundance and size of bay scallops, the abundance and size of associated predators, and record basic habitat information.  The habitat data to be provided are as follows: Presence/absence of eelgrass, Canopy height of eelgrass, Eelgrass density estimate (such as percent cover or shoot density), Presence/absence of macroalgae, Sediment type, Water depth, Turbidity/seston estimates, Dissolved oxygen, Water temperature, Salinity, Water pH, Sediments samples - to be delivered to EPA, AED for subsequent grain size analysis. The contractor shall collect the data for all parameters listed above.  The same locations shall be sampled in both summer (July) and fall (September-October) 2007 with 25 m diver transects. The contractor shall get estimates of bay scallop juveniles via the use of spat bags (mesh bags containing monofilament) within the harbor during the summer to fall months (July- September 2007).  Spat bags will be located in the same areas as the dive surveys. A Quality Management Plan/Quality Assurance Project Plan that includes survey methods shall be provided and approved by AED?s Quality Assurance Officer prior to sampling (June 2007).  The EPA will provide a format for the report upon contract award. Data from the dive surveys and spat bags shall be entered into an Excel (Microsoft Excel) database ready for statistical analysis by AED.

<DESC>Item descriptions 1 and 2 are amended to include the following requirements:  MESH MATERIAL SHALL BE POROUS WITH A THREAD COUNT BETWEEN (9-13) X (12-16) PER SQUARE INCH, WEIGHT SHALL BE BETWEEN 6-12 OUNCES PER SQUARE YARD.  AREA BETWEEN STRANDS SHALL BE 40 PERCENT OR GREATER.  SNAPS AND STUDS ARE TO BE SIZE 5/8 INCH OR EQUAL METRIC SIZE STAINLESS STEEL.  THE RB-HS AND RB-S DRAWINGS HAVE BEEN CHANGED FROM 3/8 INCH SNAP STAINLESS STEEL CAP/SOCKET TO READ 5/8 INCH SNAP STAINLESS STEEL CAP/SOCKET.  NO OTHER CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE DRAWINGS.  TO RECEIVE UPDATED COPIES OF THE RB-HS AND RB-S DRAWINGS REFLECTING THIS WORDING CHANGE, PLEASE EMAIL DIANNE.L.PALMATIER@USCG.MIL OR CALL 360-769-2417 X31.

REVISED ITEM DESCRIPTION 1:  RB-HS SET OF 3 COVERS (REFERENCE RB-HS DRAWING FOR SIZES) 105 SETS, MESH COVERS, COLOR LIGHT GRAY, MARINE QUALITY POLYESTER OR VINYL MESH WITH FLAME RETARDANT AND UV INHIBITORS, A MINIMUM 8 OZ PER SQUARE YARD POLYESTER MESH, MESH MATERIAL SHALL BE POROUS WITH A THREAD COUNT BETWEEN (9-13) X (12-16) PER SQUARE INCH, WEIGHT SHALL BE BETWEEN 6-12 OUNCES PER SQUARE YARD, AREA BETWEEN STRANDS SHALL BE 40 PERCENT OR GREATER., HALF INCH HEM WITH VINYL TEX BACKING.  SNAPS AND STUDS ARE TO BE SIZE 5/8 INCH OR EQUAL METRIC SIZE STAINLESS STEEL, 14 EACH 5/8 INCH STAINLESS STEEL BUTTON SOCKET SNAPS INSTALLED, 16 EACH 5/8 INCH # 8 - 3/8 INCH STAINLESS STEEL SCREW STUD FURNISHED WITH EACH SET;

REVISED ITEM DESCRIPTION 2: RB-S SET OF 6 COVERS (REFERENCE RB-S DRAWING FOR SIZES) 400 SETS, MESH COVERS, COLOR LIGHT GRAY, MARINE QUALITY POLYESTER OR VINYL MESH WITH FLAME RETARDANT AND UV INHIBITORS, A MINIMUM 8 OZ PER SQUARE YARD POLYESTER MESH, MESH MATERIAL SHALL BE POROUS WITH A THREAD COUNT BETWEEN (9-13) X (12-16) PER SQUARE INCH, WEIGHT SHALL BE BETWEEN 6-12 OUNCES PER SQUARE YARD, AREA BETWEEN STRANDS SHALL BE 40 PERCENT OR GREATER, HALF INCH HEM WITH VINYL TEX BACKING.  SNAPS AND STUDS ARE TO BE SIZE 5/8 INCH OR EQUAL METRIC SIZE STAINLESS STEEL, 24 EACH 5/8 INCH STAINLESS STEEL BUTTON SOCKET SNAPS INSTALLED, 28 EACH 5/8 INCH # 8 - 3/8 INCH STAINLESS STEEL SCREW STUD FURNISHED WITH EACH SET.

The following answers are provided in response to questions:
1.  Is the fabric solid or porous (i.e. must it be able to breathe), and is there a tensile strength requirement?  Mesh material shall be porous.  There is no specific requirement for tensile strength.  Reference item description changes made in this Amendment.

2.  The mesh material specified does not come in Gray.  It comes in white so is white mesh going to be ok?  White mesh is not an acceptable color.  Light gray is the preferred color but any shade of gray is acceptable as long as all sets are made of the same shade of gray.

3.  Would appreciate a clarification.... the yellow lines within each of the drawings, presume that represents the mesh?  The openings to be covered are shown in yellow on the drawing for Coast Guard installation purposes only.

4.  It is very difficult to find 3/8 inch Stainless Steel snaps and 3/8 inch studs.  Most common are 5/8 inch.  Should I base my quote on the 5/8 inch standard, or find the more expensive 3/8 inch?  Snaps and studs are to be size 5/8 inch or equal metric size stainless steel.  Reference item description changes made in this Amendment.

5.  The fabric requirement, 8 oz per sq yard polyester mesh fails to define the opening of the mesh.  The opening of the mesh is either based on the number of threads/strands per sq. inch, (20 x 20) or the amount of open area between the strands, typical 10% to 40% open.  Answer:  Area between strands shall be 40 percent or greater.  Reference item description changes made in this Amendment.

6.  We must clarify installation requirements.  Your solicitation states, to be installed, please advise if this means the awarded contractor is to install these covers and if so, what is the location for installation?  No, the contractor is not required to install these covers.  The Coast Guard will install the covers.
