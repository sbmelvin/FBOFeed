<DESC>KC-10 and KC-135 VMT Background
<p>The Agile Combat Support Directorate, Simulators Division is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the capabilities to deliver separate virtual maintenance training systems for the KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft. The trainer suites shall be designed to fit in existing classrooms. The KC-10 virtual maintenance trainers (VMTs) shall be delivered to Travis AFB, CA and McGuire AFB, NJ. Please reference the attached requirements document, Appendix B, to view the existing sizes for the KC-10 VMT classrooms. The KC-135 VMTs shall be delivered to MacDill AFB, FL, McConnell AFB, KS, and Fairchild AFB, WA. The classroom sizes for the KC-135 VMTs are to be determined.</p>
<p>KC-10 and KC-135 maintenance training is still accomplished on actual aircraft; these training activities have an impact on mission capabilities, and mission requirements regularly delay maintenance training. All training is conducted by Air Force instructors. The VMT system will be used as a training aid in the current Air Force courses and for certain proficiency levels and tasks, and consequently decrease training on an operational aircraft.</p>
<p>Please note, that at this current time, this effort will replace all previous KC-10 and KC-135 efforts to procure or obtain further information about Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI). The requirement is for a virtual maintenance trainer that purely replicates the operations of the actual aircraft.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Spokane Research Laboratory (SRL) hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to CSIRO to provide Coal Mine Safety Applications of Seismic Monitoring.
<p>BACKGROUND<br />NIOSH is engaged in a detailed study of ground deformation mechanics at an underground coal mine as part of a mine safety research study to improve mine designs and reduce hazards under deep cover mining conditions. As part of the seismic monitoring component of this research effort, a close-in microseismic monitoring array was deployed by NIOSH at a deep operating longwall coal mine. Data are streamed to a server in real-time and processed to provide microseismic event location coordinates and estimates of event magnitude and other source parameters. <br />Accuracy of the event locations and other calculated parameters is limited by accuracy of the seismic velocity model. Whereas a uniform constant velocity model is typically found to be adequate for use in monitoring systems deployed in hard rock mines, such a simplified model gives poor, and even misleading, results when applied to the deep coal mining environment. High accuracy event locations are required to achieve the project's research objectives.</p>
<p>This procurement addresses the need to acquire effective methods to characterize complicated velocity structures in coal mines, and to incorporate this information into effective processing strategies and algorithms which are wholly compatible with the existing data processing workflow.</p>
<p>PROJECT OBJECTIVES<br />The objective is to improve seismic event locations at the NIOSH research site by providing the capability to develop more realistic velocity models that account for the spatial and temporal variation of seismic velocity found in deep longwall coal mine environments.</p>
<p>These objectives can be met by acquiring the capability to frequently update the seismic velocity model through a data inversion scheme that incorporates simultaneous solutions for event locations, seismic velocity model elements and station corrections, and independent velocity measurements from calibration shots, seismic refraction surveys, sonic logs, etc. This new capability is to be integrated with the existing seismic data processing workflow.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />1. Provide capability to update seismic velocity models using passive seismic sources and other sources of velocity information.</p>
<p>2. Incorporate methods into procedure and code form compatible with existing data processing workflow.</p>
<p>3. Facilitate installation and testing of software on NIOSH computers.</p>
<p>Compatibility Requirements</p>
<p>The newly developed velocity model development and event location capabilities must be fully compatible with the existing NIOSH implementation of the IMS seismic recording and processing system installed at the mine field site and processing facilities in the NIOSH Spokane, WA office.</p>
<p>Procedure and computer code must operate on proprietary IMS data files containing arrival time picks from Jmts software.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2012-Q-14511. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with CSIRO, 1 Technology Court, Pullenvale QLD 4060 Australia as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<CONTACT>Deborah K. Foley, Contract Specialist, Phone 2023239570, Email Deborah.Foley@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a sole source contract to BAE Systems Information Solutions, Inc., 2525 Network Place, Herndon, VA 20171 to upgrade and replace the FBI's aging XTS-400 systems. In order to mitigate potential risks and vulnerabilities in the XTS-400 platforms, BAE Systems will provide XTS-500 infrastructure platforms. The XTS-500 systems will strengthen the FBI's ability to continue to operate their cross domain services applications with enhanced functionality and security in the face of emergent risks such as leaks and other threats. The period of performance, to include system and software operation and maintenance support services, is one base year and four option years.
<p>Market research efforts concluded that only by procuring a follow-on system that is already compatible with the FBI's cross domain architecture, could the FBI obtain an enterprise cross domain platform that can be installed and implemented without extensive and costly reprogramming of existing cross domain solutions, time-intensive certification and accreditation of multiple systems, and retraining of government personnel, all which have the potential to adversely impact the security and integrity of the FBI's classified systems.</p>
<p>BAE is the sole developer and manufacturer of the XTS-400 system platform and has over 20 years of experience supporting XTS systems in the FBI environment. In addition, BAE has the requisite intimate knowledge to upgrade this system with little risk to the FBI's critical financial and law enforcement applications. The FBI has determined that only BAE Systems Information Solutions can fulfill this requirement without substantial schedule delays, risks and duplication of costs.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen&nbsp;days&nbsp;after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement."</p>

<SUBJECT>Medicine Bow/Routt/White River (MBR/WR) Long Term Stewardship Contract
<SOLNBR>AG-82X9-S-12-9001
<CONTACT>Martin A. Martinez, Phone 3032755785, Email mmartinez02@fs.fed.us
<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">SYNOPSIS:<br /><br />The USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Region, Contracting Office located at 740 Simms Street, Golden, CO 80465 intends to award one or two multi-year contract(s) for stewardship services under the authority of 16 USC 2104. The resulting contract(s) will be for a performance period not to exceed 10 years encompassing two National Forests totaling approximately 20,000 acres. The Government reserves the right to award each contract for a National Forest separately or to award both contracts for each National Forests to one Contractor based on what the Government believes to be in its best interest. This acquisition is available for competition to both large and small businesses.</p>
<p>A variety of methods will be used to designate trees to be cut and removed. Designation methods commonly include Designation by Species and Diameter, Designation by Damage Class and Individual Tree Marking. Designation methods will be specified in individual Task Orders. Conditions we wish to achieve are addressed below under "intent of this contract" and in "Desired Conditions", Section C. Project planning and design will, to the extent possible, minimize unnecessary operational costs associated with hauling restrictions and road construction, reconstruction, and maintenance.</p>
<p>Although this solicitation emphasizes biomass removal to the greatest extent possible, it is not a requirement. This solicitation has incorporated many design changes, which are considered critical and with the intent of attracting bids that contributes to the Forest Service's goal of significantly reduced per acre costs.</p>
<p>The Medicine Bow-Routt/White River (MBR/WR) Long Term Stewardship Contract is a landscape level project that aspires to treat approximately 20,000 acres of subalpine and mountain forests on portions of the Medicine Bow-Routt and White River National Forests in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado over the next 10 years. Our vision is that we will offer one, or two, long-term stewardship contract(s) with a minimum annual treatment of 1,000 acres per forest. Each task order will average at least 15 green tons of forest products per acre.</p>
<p>The contract(s) resulting from this solicitation are/is intended to be the first step toward implementing this goal and is expected to include fuels reduction, forest health, and rehabilitation treatments on at least 20,000 acres over a maximum period of ten years. The contract(s) will use task orders issued periodically that will be the contractual mechanism implementing work requirements, funding, and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) decisions. NEPA decisions have already been completed for those treatment units which will be provided on the initial set(s) of task orders that will be issued after award of the contract(s). Environmental analyses and resource clearances will be completed for the remaining areas of the contract(s) prior to issuance of task orders.</p>
<p>The contract may be awarded to one Contractor for both Forests or be split among a maximum of 2 Contractors (one on each Forest). Award of resulting contract(s) will be made on basis of best value to the Government.</p>
<p>The intent of this contract is to support traditional timber industry and emerging biomass industries and:</p>
<p>1. Continue mitigation of undesirable effects of a multi-million acre, mountain pine beetle infestation and to augment establishment of the future forest;</p>
<p>2. Mitigate unacceptable fuel loading fire hazard associated with the bark beetle infestation within the Wildland-Urban Interface;</p>
<p>3. Treat safety hazards associated with falling dead trees along public travel corridors and around public infrastructure; and</p>
<p>4. Begin rehabilitating subalpine and mountain forest types to a condition more resistant to insects, disease, and other disturbance mechanisms. The overall objective for these treatments is to increase age class and species diversity , promote forest resilience to disturbance, watershed health, and improved habitat for a variety of wildlife species.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Medicine Bow-Routt and White River National Forests have seen a dramatic increase in mountain pine beetle-caused, tree mortality. In fact, approximately 90% of the mature lodgepole pine trees on both forests are now infested. In association with extensive tree mortality, there is a growing incidence of falling trees that pose a safety hazard to the public and/or threaten to damage private and public properties. In addition, the rate of heavy fuels accumulation associated with dead and falling trees represents the potential for increased fire hazard and severity in the event a wildfire occurs. Heavy fuels pose a significant safety hazard to many Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) communities throughout northern Colorado and southern Wyoming.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we see the same emerging issues in all forested cover types. 85-90% of National Forest system lands in the Rocky Mountain Region support mature stands with less than 5% of the total area represented in young forest. The area covered under this contract includes lodgepole pine, subalpine fir and Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, aspen, limber pine, ponderosa pine, pinion pine and juniper tree species - all of which occur primarily in mature stands that are highly susceptible to insect and disease infestations.</p>

<DESC>The Intelligent Systems Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducts research activities on smart and wireless sensor network standards in support of the Smart Manufacturing and Construction Systems (SMCS) program. Sensor networks based on the IEEE 1451 standard for a smart transducer interface for sensors and actuators are needed to support the SMCS program for the development of measurement science-based performance and conformance testing framework that would enable the integration of real-time factory equipment information and achieve optimization of manufacturing applications.
<p>An IEEE 1451 standard-based sensor network consists of a network capable device connected to one or more sensor devices. According to the IEEE 1451 suite of standards, the network capable device is called Network Capable Application Process (NCAP) and the sensor device is called Transducer Interface Module (TIM). If the connection between the NCAP and the TIM is a wireless link, the sensor device is called Wireless Transducer Interface Module (WTIM). One of the key features of the IEEE 1451 standard is the specification sensor datasheet in electronic format, called Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS). The TEDS associated with a TIM or WTIM contains manufacturer-related information that can identify the sensor or actuator and describe the characteristics of the sensor or actuator, such as type of measurement, measurement range, calibration, etc. The TEDS data is stored in a memory device in a TIM or WTIM. A computer can be connected to the NCAP via a RJ45 Ethernet port. Application software running in the computer can access sensor information from any TIM or WTIM connected to the NCAP using the IEEE 1451.0 standard's command/response messaging protocols.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure a custom-built smart sensor network system. The system must consist of two IEEE 1451-based sensor networks including hardware and software components. The hardware component must consist of the sensor network comprising of NCAP, TIM, and WTIM devices. The software component must consist of the code that implements the specific IEEE 1451.X standards to provide the performance that will be specified in the request for quotation. The required smart sensor network system must contain embedded microprocessors running custom-built operating systems for sensor network operation offline that does not require any IT network administration, like the Windows operating system.</p>
<p>The required equipment is non-commercial in nature and will be competed using simplified acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 334119, Other Computer Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing. The small business size standard for this requirement is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-12-RQ-0279.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation. The Government will not maintain a mailing list.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The successful offeror must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov, in order to be eligible to receive a purchase order under this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine to modify an existing contract with Level 3 Communications, LLC, 1025 Eldorado Boulevard, Broomfiled, CO 80021, under the authority of FAR 6.302 for Internet Connectivity Services. NLM intends on extending the contract from 2/15/2012 - 4/14/2012. Vendors may identify in writing their interest and capability in response to this requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However all responses received no later than the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world's largest biomedical library and the developer of electronic information services that deliver trillions of bytes of data to millions of users every day. Scientists, health professionals, and the public in the US and around the globe search the Library's online information resources more than one billion times each year. Large data sets are also frequently exchanged among NLM and its research partners domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>The Office of Computer and Communications Systems (OCCS) of the National Library of Medicine provides efficient, cost-effective computing and networking services, application development, technical advice, and collaboration in informational sciences in support of the research and management programs offered through the NLM.</p>
<p>OCCS develops, operates, and maintains the backbone computer network and facilities, and supports, guides, and assists other NLM components in local area networking. The Division provides professional programming services and computational and data processing facilities to meet NLM program needs; operates and maintains the NLM Network Operations and Computing Facility; designs and develops software; and provides extensive customer support, training courses and seminars, and documentation for computer and network users.</p>
<p>OCCS helps to coordinate, integrate, and standardize the vast array of computer services available throughout all of the organizations comprising NLM. The Division also serves as a technological resource for other parts of the NLM and for other Federal organizations with biomedical, statistical, and administrative computing needs. The Division promotes the application of High Performance Computing and Communication to biomedical problems, including image processing and information security.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide high speed Internet connectivity to the National Library of Medicine's network which is located in Bethesda, Maryland. This will provide commodity Internet access to the public as well as the research and medical communities around the world. This connectivity needs to be provided via a Global Tier 1 Internet Service Provider (ISP). It must also include protected circuit connections from the ISP Point of Presence (POP) to NLM. These connections cannot be provided by the current ISPs that are presently being used by the Center for Information Technology (CIT) within the National Institutes of Health Network (NIHNET), since NLM uses the CIT/NIH internet connections as a backup. This connectivity must initially provide 2 Gbps bandwidth. The provider must have the capability to upgrade the connections up to 10 Gbps bandwidth.</p>
<p>Order HHSN276200700077P with Level 3 is scheduled to end 2/15/2012. In August 2012 the services were re-competed and an award was made to Global Crossing with contract HHSN276201100015C. Because of delays in the transition NLM intends on extending the order from 2/15/2012 - 4/14/2012.</p>
<p>The extension will give Global Crossing, the new NLM-Internet contract holder, additional time to install a new communications circuit for the upgrade of Internet services from a 2 Gigabit bandwidth to a 10 Gigabit circuit. Global Crossing has been delayed in installing the new circuit because of various reasons including: permit delays due to road construction in the area, delays in working with NIH networking groups to plan and coordinate cable installation on the NIH campus, and a Global Crossing corporate ownership change.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMNET FOR UPGRADES TO STABILIZED RADIOMETER PLATFORMS. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis with L-3 Communications Somona EO, INC for inspection, validation, and upgrade of two Navy Stabilized Radiometer Platforms (STRAPs). The STRAPs utilize a self-contained, coupled Inertial Navigation System-GPS pair to actively maintain a set of radiometers in a horizontal and level position during flight (straight and level, as well as during maneuvers like turns, ascents and descents). NRL's requirement is the maturation and hardening of the two currently existing Navy Stabilized Radiometer Platforms to make them robust and reliable enough for use in field studies or routine flights.  The design and some of the components in the STRAPs are proprietary to L-3 Sonoma EO.
<p>Vendors who feel capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interests and submit written data or other verifiable documentation that demonstrates conclusively the capabilities of their proposed services to meet the stated requirements within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Responses received after 15 days or without the required documentation will be determined non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.</p>

The plan shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-8 and  52.219-9 and AFARS 19.705.

The subsequent contracts will be performed for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Wilmington VA Medical Center, Wilmington, Delaware.    As a result of the solicitation, the Government intends that approximately eight (8) indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts will be awarded providing sufficient qualified contractors present acceptable offers. This is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set aside.   Contractors must be registered in the US Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Biz Database to be eligible to submit a proposal.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/. Contractors must be verified as a SDVOSB to be eligible for award.  Contractor must be registered in Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov to be eligible for award.  Additionally, contractors must be registered with Vets 100 at http://vets.dol.gov/vets100/ and complete their online Representations and Certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The applicable NAICS code is 236220 with a size standard of $33.5 million in average annual receipts.   Awards will be made to offerors whose proposals are responsive and conforming to the RFP, and are also determined to be most advantageous to the Government in terms of Technical, Past Performance, and Price. Work to be performed under the MATOC contract(s) will include construction and design/build projects.  Typical work includes, but is not limited to: interior and exterior renovations and alterations, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, heating and air-conditioning, HVAC controls, fire suppression, and intrusion alarms, communications, limited utilities, site-work, landscaping, fencing, masonry, roofing, concrete, asphalt, paving, storm drainage, limited environmental remediation, construction of new facilities, demolition, surveys, design/build and other related work.  Projects will principally be design/bid/build type from already completed designs, or projects specified by a statement of work using the VA Master Specifications.  However, offerings may include some design/build projects.  Award of the design/build option may be restricted to companies having demonstrated past performance and technical capability for performing design/build projects. Contractors can qualify for a base contract without submitting a proposal for design/build.  The resulting contracts will not have fixed unit costs.  All contract work will be completed through individual task orders awarded for individual projects at the Wilmington VA Medical Center campus.  Each task order will be priced individually and will include its own wage determination.  These task orders will be competed amongst the IDIQ awardees only.

The minimum guaranteed order for each contract is one (1) task order valued at a minimum of $5,000 or if no task order project is awarded a guaranteed fee of $5,000 will be paid to the contractor. The minimum fee will only be paid if the awarded contractor continues to compete for, but is not awarded, a task order throughout the life of the contract. If a contractor is not awarded all option years as a result of a contractor failing to submit proposals or as a result of poor past performance on previous task orders, the contractor will not be entitled to the minimum guarantee.   The Government reserves the right to issue additional solicitations and award construction contracts within the activities covered by the proposed MATOC contracts to contractors other than those awarded a contract under this solicitation. This is not a solicitation for a Requirements Contract.  The anticipated release date for the Solicitation is on or about May 7, 2012.  The solicitation will be posted at this website, www.fbo.gov.

We are seeking capabilities from all Small Businesses qualifed to perform under the NAICS: 488190, Size Standard $30M as of March 26, 2012, FSC: J016 to determine the market interest and capability. This document is for information and planning purposes only. Companies are invited to submit their capabilities to support this potential requirement as identified below (to include OCONUS experience). The offerors shall identify their socio-economic size, category and experience associated with the NAICS specific to flight line maintenance. Companies may respond via email to Diana R. Graziano at diana.graziano@hurlburt.af.mil no later than 4 May 2012, 2:00 p.m. CST. <br />When responding, reference in the subject block:&nbsp;FA0021SSCV22MAY2012. This Sources Sought is market research and is for Information only it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in responses. Respondents will not be notified of the results. It is the responsibility of each company to monitor the Internet site https://www.fbo.gov for any further informational releases(if any). <br />If a solicitation goes out, it will be posted under the RFP number FA0021-12-R-0012.
<p>This sources sought is to test the market to see industry capability for non-personal CV-22 Contractor Maintenance Support (CMS) services to Hurlburt Field, Florida, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, Cannon AFB, New Mexico, RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom, and potential for a future base in PACOM (the OCONUS locations will be supported via TDYs). This effort is planned for a base period of twelve (12) months with two (2), twelve month option periods. The CV-22 aircraft have the primary missions of combat and training missions driving both CONUS and O-CONUS support requirements. The CV-22 is a weapons system that currently has limited organic maintenance capability. Because of organic maintenance capability, complexity of the aircraft, and programmed growth, the maintenance concept is a combined effort of active-duty Air Force and Contractor Maintenance Support (CMS) technicians. Both active-duty Air Force and CMS technicians are responsible for Organizational level (O-level) and Intermediate level (I-level) maintenance. The CV-22 aircraft located at Hurlburt Field, FL, Cannon AFB, NM, and RAF Mildenhall, UK, and potential for a future base in the PACOM AOR are operational assets that will be deployed overseas to conduct and support AFSOC operations. CMS personnel assigned to those locations will be required to deploy or perform temporary duty world-wide in support of CV-22 mission requirements. CMS personnel supporting operations at RAF Midlenhall, UK and the potential future base in the PACOM AOR will be required to perform these duties on a temporary duty rotational basis. The CMS service provider shall provide V-22 experienced maintenance production supervision and personnel to execute all Organizational and applicable Intermediate (O and I)-level maintenance operations. The requirement is a mix of Mechanical Specialty Maintainers and Electrical/Avionics Specialty Maintainers in sufficient numbers in the applicable functional areas to manage, supervise, and perform all tasks required by the SOW. The CV-22 program will continue to mature from a current 23 aircraft to an end-state of 50 aircraft. Final aircraft basing is not yet determined. The increase in aircraft may drive a requirement for additional growth in CMS personnel to conduct aircraft maintenance and on-the-job training at each location. The specific personnel requirements include:</p>
<p>Program Manager (PM): The PM is required to have a minimum of 18 years experience in aircraft maintenance and working knowledge of flightline operations/supervision. Although not required, the Government desires an Airframe and Power Plant certification for this position as well as V-22 specific experience. This position will be located at Hurlburt Field, FL.</p>
<p>Site POC: The POC at each location is required to have 15 years experience in aircraft maintenance and flightline operations/supervision. The Government desires this position to have three (3) years of V-22 experience; however, one year of documented recent (within the past three years) experience on the V-22 is required. The POCs shall be fully qualified in their primary specialty Mechanical (APG) and/or Electrical/Avionics Specialty in order to be available to perform aircraft maintenance daily. Although not required, the Government highly desires an Airframe and Power Plant certification for this position.</p>
<p><br />CMS TEAM REQUIREMENTS/QUALIFICATIONS <br />Aircraft Maintenance Experience. CMS personnel must have a minimum of seven (7) years continuous aircraft maintenance background/experience in an Aircraft Mechanical or Aircraft Electrical/Avionics specialty on any fixed-wing or rotary aircraft. Furthermore, it is the Government's desire to attain personnel with three (3) years of V-22 experience; however, one (1) year of documented recent (within the past three (3) years) experience on the V-22 is required.</p>
<p>The CMS service provider shall provide V-22 experienced maintenance production supervision and personnel to execute all Organizational and applicable Intermediate (O and I)-level maintenance operations. The requirement is a mix of Mechanical Specialty Maintainers and Electrical/Avionics Specialty Maintainers (Attachment 1, Level of Support / Growth) in sufficient numbers in the applicable functional areas to manage, supervise, and perform all tasks required by the SOW. All CMS personnel shall be fully trained, qualified, and certified as necessary for their respective tasks, with equivalent certifications matching the Air Force's program of 7-level certifications.</p>
<p>Mechanical Specialty Maintainer: Overall intent of the Mechanical Specialty Maintainer is to have the primary background/qualifications equivalent to the Air Force "APG/Crew Chief" mechanic with secondary skill sets of Engines, Hydraulics, and Fuels specialties listed in Attachment 6, Secondary Mechanical JQS. This requires the skill set of maintaining and managing all aspects of aircraft maintenance. The Contractor shall submit Mechanical candidates who possess the knowledge, experience and equivalent certifications of a 7-level Air Force APG mechanic and are at least 80 percent qualified/proficient on the Mechanical Specialty tasks listed at Attachment 3, Mechanical JQS. Candidates/employees shall become fully qualified in the secondary skill sets within a reasonable and realistic period as identified in the contractor's proposal/training plan.</p>
<p>Electrical/Avionics Specialty Maintainer: Overall intent of the Electrical/Avionics Specialty Maintainer is to have the primary background/qualifications equivalent to either of the aircraft Electrical/Environmental or Aircraft Avionics specialties, but ultimately shall be qualified in both skill sets identified. The Contractor shall submit candidates who possess the knowledge, experience and equivalent certifications of a 7-level Air Force Electrical/Avionics Technician and are at least 80 percent qualified/proficient on either the Electrical/Environmental or Avionics Specialty tasks listed at Attachment 4, Avionics JQS or Attachment 5.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.
<p><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611-Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a Market Survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below:</p>
<p>1.0 Background</p>
<p>The NLM Ethics Office within the Executive Office is responsible for management of the NLM Ethics Program. The NLM Ethics Office is charged with providing technical advice, support, guidance, and resources to the Library=s programs to implement the ethics policies, procedures and guidance promulgated by the NIH Ethics Program. This requires appropriate resources and staff with extensive ethics knowledge and the ability to translate that knowledge into useable resources for the NLM community.</p>
<p>2.0 Objective</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement is to provide technical and operational support to the NLM Ethics Office staff in its implementation of the NIH Ethics program requirements and the provision of timely and efficient ethics services to management and employees.</p>
<p>3.0 Scope</p>
<p>The work requirement covers all areas of the NLM Ethics program including data management via the use of the NIH Ethics Enterprise System (NEES) and the Ethics Management Information System (EMIS), and the evaluation of program implementation. Due to additional responsibilities, time constraints, and other workload requirements, the following services and products are required to support, maintain, and enhance the ability of the NLM ethics staff to provide ethics services to the NLM community.</p>
<p>4.0 Contractor Tasks</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not other&not;wise provided by the Government, to perform task assignments at the direction of the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) in the following Task Areas. All work shall be monitored and technically co-ordinated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>4.1 Task Area 1: Program Evaluation</p>
<p>In preparation for an external program review, the Contractor shall conduct a thorough internal review of the ethics program procedures, actions, and files for the purpose of evaluating compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and established NIH Ethics Office and HHS ethics policies and procedures as well as evaluating the use of the NEES system in the action review process. This evaluation will involve the review of physical files and electronic documents. The Contractor shall conduct the review and provide a written report of findings. Review will require approximately 40 hours.</p>
<p>4.2 Task Area 2: Program Activities</p>
<p>The NLM Ethics Office needs additional assistance during periods of high work load levels or difficult situations. For example, the NLM Ethics Coordinator may need assistance with a Contractor to review financial disclosure reports and outside activities, the development of written procedures, assistance with technical review of other ethics documents, review and preparation of responses to the Department and/or Congress, or conduct research for responses to ethics questions posed by management or employees. The Contractor shall provide assistance in the preparation of general ethics guidance when needed and in the technical review of ethics documents. In addition, the Contractor shall develop training aids and participate in employee training sessions as needed. This requires a vendor with extensive ethics knowledge, ability to provide succinct and correct advice, and time to work on special projects as they arise. This portion will be on an as needed basis but will require approximately 40 hours.</p>
<p>4.3 Task Area 3: Data Management Support (EMIS &amp; NEES)</p>
<p>The NIH Ethics Office requires that all data regarding ethics documents be entered in the EMIS system on an on-going regular basis. It is a high priority to maintain NLM's data in the EMIS database and enter new data as appropriate. The project requires a person knowledgeable in both ethics requirements and IT terminology and expertise in utilizing the system in order to quickly populate the database in an efficient and accurate manner. Vendor would be responsible for performing technical review of data, identifying and entering needed data into the system, reviewing data to ensure that correct information is entered, and working with NLM users to enhance their ability to use EMIS. As NIH continues to roll out new applications on the NEES system, the vendor may assist with new requirements of this particular system. This portion may take approximately 20 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 13. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.</p>
<p>(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement should contain enough sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities; however, the statement should not exceed ten (10) pages.</p>

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice.
<p>The purpose of this announcement is for market research purposes to determine if capable Small Businesses relative to North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code 334511 for Search, Detection, Navigation, guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical system and Instrument Manufacturing are available.</p>
<p>The National Marine Fishery Service is in need of Satellite tags that are to be deployed&nbsp;on a&nbsp;marine mammal research cruise in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer of 2012. These tags will utilize the ARGOS satellite system to transmit dive data from select marine mammals and also provide the means for accurate geolocation while the animal is surfaced. The tags will be applied remotely via a compressed air powered launcher from the bow of a small boat at the zenith of a close approach to a select animal. These tags must withstand the impact g-forces generated by the delivery process and must sustain regular dives to at least 1000 meters. The tags will be packaged in a slender cylindrical sleeve made of surgical stainless steel. This stainless steel body must allow for the attachment of a screw on anchor mechanism on the end opposite from the wet switches and transmission antenna. These tags are routinely used in research to determine spatial distribution, better understand habitat use and help to understand population dynamics.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the Authority Cited: The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Title VIII, PL 103-355) as implemented at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 and FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b). Wildlife Computers, Inc. has designed and built the above satellite tags. They have proprietary drawings, engineering data and parts necessary to build these essential components. As an example of the intricate requirements of these satellite tags, the following are minimum functional requirements of the tags: operational range in open ocean environment attached to moving animals to depths of 1000m, temperature of 0o to 60o C, and placed globally; lithium battery sufficient to sample data for one year and transmit at least 10,000 32 byte transmissions; tag with salt-water switch and with out-of-water sonsor;16 Mbytes of non-volatile flash memory; 12-bit analog converters to provide high-accuracy depth and temperature readings; 8-bit analog-to-digital converter for light level and battery voltage readings; depth accuracy of 1% or better, measureable between 0-1000m with a resolution of 0.5m; temperature accuracy of 1% or better, measurable from 0 to +60o C with a resolution of 0.05C; on-board real-time clock temperature-compensated to accurately time data readings. These specifications are essential to ensure the compatibility of results with earlier results of the similar studies. Wildlife Computers is the only U.S. Supplier that has satellite tags meeting the requirements for obtaining the data required by the project objectives.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought shall not constitute responses to any solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 5.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation currently exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice.

<DESC>Taxonomic Analysis of Algae and Benthic Invertebrate Samples
Request for Information (RFI)
This is not an announcement of a Solicitation. 
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) needs to assess industry interest and capability to provide taxonomic analysis of freshwater benthic algae and invertebrate samples.  The overarching objective of this RFI is information gathering and not acquisition of products or services. 
PURPOSE, SCOPE & INFORMATION SOUGHT:  Part of the mission of the USGS is to provide an understanding of water-quality conditions; whether conditions are getting better or worse over time; and how natural features and human activities affect those conditions. Regional and national assessments are possible because of a consistent study design and uniform methods of data collection and analysis. Biological, chemical, and physical monitoring data are integrated with geographic information on hydrological characteristics, land use, and other landscape features in models to extend water-quality understanding to unmonitored areas. Local, State, Tribal, and national stakeholders use water quality information to design and implement strategies for managing, protecting, and monitoring water resources in many different hydrologic and land-use settings across the Nation.
This is a general request for information to determine industry's capability to perform laboratory analysis of freshwater benthic algae and invertebrate samples. Laboratory analysis includes washing/sieving samples, subsampling and sorting organisms, preparing slides, identifying and enumerating organisms, and related quality assurance/quality control. Responses should address the following:
1.	Ability to process freshwater benthic algae and invertebrate samples including related quality assurance/quality control procedures, according to standard, widely accepted, and documented protocols. Examples of USGS approved protocols are listed below. Laboratories using protocols other than approved USGS protocols should describe in sufficient detail (or provide a URL link to such information) the procedures they use. 
a.	Charles, D.F., Knowles, C., and Davis, R.S. (eds.). 2002. Protocols for the analysis of algal samples collected as part of the U.S. Geological Survey National Water-Quality Assessment Program. Academy of Natural Sciences Report No. 02-06, 124 p. [available at: http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/protocols/algprotocol/index.html]
b.	Moulton II, S.R., Carter, J.L., Grotheer, S.A., Cuffney, T.F., and Short, T.M. 2000. Methods of analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Laboratory-- Processing, taxonomy, and quality control of benthic macroinvertebrate samples. U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 00-212, 49 p. [available at: http://nwql.usgs.gov/Public/pubs/OFR00-212.pdf]
2.	Ability to participate in external quality control testing of sample analysis. Examples of such testing might include, but are not limited to: (1) processing split samples by independent laboratories to assess comparability of taxonomic identifications and enumerations; or (2) submit synoptic reference collections that are reviewed by independent analysts to evaluate the accuracy of taxonomic identifications.
3.	Information about the educational level/major, professional experience and certifications of staff involved in processing samples described in No. 1 above.
4.	Ability to complete sample analysis within six (6) months of receiving a sample and comply with requirements to interact with the USGS BioData Data Management System [https://aquatic.biodata.usgs.gov]. The BioData system stores, maintains, and distributes algae and invertebrate identification and enumeration data. Laboratories must interact with this system to (1) obtain lab orders placed by USGS personnel, and (2) to upload taxonomic identification and enumeration results produced by the laboratory. Prior to interacting with the system a laboratory must:
-	Designate one or more data managers who will retrieve laboratory orders, upload data, and serve as the principle points of contact for USGS system administrators and data managers. The laboratory data managers will be given access to the BioData system contingent on USGS approval.-	Complete BioData laboratory-user training provided by USGS.-	Demonstrate that laboratory data managers understand the lab order and laboratory results upload file format, content, and validation requirements.-	Successfully complete a test upload of taxonomic identification and enumeration laboratory results.Laboratories download orders prior to processing samples shipped to them by USGS personnel. Each order represents one sample that must be processed and reported as a unit. The laboratory order download is a zip file containing three tab-delimited tables that list (1) laboratory orders, (2) containers associated with each order, and (3) the sites where samples were collected. Laboratories can use the information to support sample processing. The LabOrderID provided by BioData must be used when data are delivered to associate laboratory results with the applicable BioData lab order. Descriptions of three tables are available at https://my.usgs.gov/confluence/display/biodata/BioData+Lab+Handbook.
Analytical results must be delivered to the BioData system by uploading a data file. Laboratory data managers will be provided access to perform that task. The file must meet all of the data format, content, and validation rules specified by USGS.  Detailed information about these requirements is available at https://my.usgs.gov/confluence/display/biodata/BioData+Lab+Handbook.

1.	INTRODUCTION
This Sources Sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.  Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for the Office of Informatics & Analytics (OIA).  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore please do not request a copy of the solicitation. 

2.	BACKGROUND
VA eHealth University (VeHU) is VA's annual training conference that provides education on the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and related clinical software developed by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VeHU highlights innovations towards patient care through training classes on VHA's clinical informatics products. The VeHU Conference provides training to providers, nurses, health information managers, pharmacists, clinical informatics support staff, imaging coordinators, radiologists, and points of contact for the My HealtheVet web site.  The conference consists of plenary sessions, didactic lecture sessions, and hands on training computer lab sessions.  Following the eHealth conferences, resources from the conferences are posted on the CPRS Training Web site for performance support and enhancement.  The VHA eHealth conference is separated into five tracks: Clinical Informatics Support (CIS) Track, Nursing Track, Pharmacy Track, Provider Track, and Health Information Manager Track. VeHU currently has a group Facebook page and a Twitter feed. These social media sites are maintained and have current content posted daily based on VA's Social Media guidelines.

In order to provide an engaging and educational online learning resource, VA initiated development of a single web-based modality that serves to introduce and guide VA staff through the many online resources available from past VeHU conferences.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for the Office of Informatics & Analytics (OIA).  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore please do not request a copy of the solicitation. 

2.	BACKGROUND
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA) initiated the development and launch of a unique, engaging and immersive web based learning community titled MyVeHU Campus (MVC).  Launched in March of 2011, MVC serves to introduce and guide VA and VHA staff thru the many online resources available from past VA eHealth University (VeHU) Face-to-Face (F2F) conferences and provides an engaging, educational, and accessible online learning resource.  VeHU is VA's annual training conference that provides education on the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and related clinical software developed by VHA. Every year VeHU highlights innovations towards patient care through training classes on VHA's clinical informatics products.  

This contracting initiative shall provide VHA OIA and the MVC learning community with the necessary development resources to expand its services and capabilities to reach and deliver live, interactive, and on-demand training and education to an ever expanding audience in near real time and at a greatly reduced cost.

3.	OBJECTIVES

The contractor shall provide all production equipment, required technical staff, and development of scripts for recording and producing a series of VA assigned online hosts which will be integrated into both modalities of the MVC.

<DESC>Attention all vendors!  Your feedback is sought to provide feedback on the<br>Pre-Award and Post-Award debriefing process related to federal government<br>procurements.   <br><br>Background.  A government research team jointly sponsored by the Army<br>Acquisition Support Center and the Partnership for Public Service is<br>conducting a study to determine the value and effectiveness of debriefings<br>given by government contracting agencies to vendors bidding for federal<br>contracts.  To help make that assessment, the team has developed an on-line<br>survey to capture feedback from vendors who have received Pre-Award or<br>Post-Award debriefings.<br><br>Target audience:  All vendors who have: (a) submitted bids on federal<br>contracts within the last 3 years; and (b) participated in at least one<br>Pre-Award or Post-Award debriefing conducted by a federal contracting<br>officer or agency.<br><br>What is requested?  Completion of the on-line survey found at the web site<br>listed below.<br><br>Why is my participation & feedback important?  As the ultimate "customer" of<br>the feedback sessions, the research team wants to know if the process is<br>useful to you and your company and, if not, what the government can do to<br>make it better.<br><br>How long will it take to complete?  10 - 15 minutes. The survey consists of<br>17 questions-most of which are multiple choice along with several<br>opportunities to add narrative remarks.<br><br>Are my responses secure and anonymous?  Yes.  <br><br>How will the results be used?  The results will be summarized for analysis<br>to determine how the debriefing process can be improved.  The team plans to<br>make the findings available to any federal contracting activity operating<br>under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines.  It is<br>anticipated some of the recommendations will be incorporated into agency<br>policies, publications and training material to assist the federal<br>acquisition workforce in conducting better debriefings.<br><br>Will I be able to see or access the research team's findings and report?<br>While the details have not yet been finalized, the team plans to make the<br>information available to all interested parties on or about 1 Aug 2012 via<br>an amendment  or another posting to FEBBIZ.<br><br>ACCESS THE SURVEY NOW BY CLICKING ON THE LINK BELOW:<br><br>(By clicking below, you will be redirected to a web site operated by<br>SurveyMonkeyR.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION
<SOLNBR>DE-AC27-07RV14884
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:Stephanie_C_Chu@rl.gov">Chu, Stephanie C</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of River Protection (ORP) intends to award a firm fixed price modification to Contract Number DE-AC27-07RV14884, by means other than full and open competition.  DOE-ORP intends to award a sole source contract modification to Energy Solutions, LLC, located at 6100 Chevy Chase Drive, Laurel, MD, 20707.  Work associated with Modification 016 will support development of the vitrification process for the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP).  The WTP is expected to treat both High-Level Waste (HLW) and Low-Activity Waste (LAW).
Task 1: Melter Testing of New High-Bi High-Level Waste (HLW) Formulations.  Work under this task will be directed at determining the effect of the processing characteristics of newly developed glass formulations for high-Bi HLW.  The HLW glasses for melter testing will be selected from previous work for DOE-ORP.  Processing characteristics of the selected glass formulations will be assessed using DM100 melter tests.  The melter tests will be used to determine feed processing rate, cold-cap behavior, feed carry over, etc., and to identify any processing issues.  Two DM100 melter tests, each five days in duration are planned using two different high-Bi HLW glass formulations.  The task involves submittal and approval of a test plan, completion of DM100 melter tests, and completion of a portion of the data analysis and reporting.
Task 2: Enhanced Low Activity Waste (LAW) Glass Property-Composition Models.  WTP has developed glass property-composition models to control glass compositions for LAW vitrification at Hanford.  These models are based on data from crucible scale tests to large scale LAW Pilot Melter tests, providing high confidence in the models and glass compositions selected for waste processing.  However, these models are based on the glass property-composition data which have much lower waste loadings than compositions subsequently developed for LAW processing.  To utilize the advantages of the new higher waste loading formulations for LAW processing at the WTP, the LAW glass property-composition models need to be updated to incorporate these new compositions.  This task involves submittal and approval of a test plan, complete assessment of the LAW glass database, and design of composition matrices to augment the database.   
Competition Exception:DOE-ORP has determined that this requirement can only be satisfied by the unique services offered by Energy Solutions, LLC.  The statutory authority permitting this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), where a determination has been made that the supplies or services required by the  agency are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or  services will satisfy agency requirements.  Energy Solutions, LLC, through its exclusive agreement with Catholic University of America (CUA), Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL), is the only firm that is uniquely capable of providing the technical expertise and facilities necessary to complete the tasks described above.  These tasks will be performed at the glass development laboratory and melter test facility at CUA-VSL, in Washington, D.C.  Performance of these tasks requires the use of a DM100 melter, which resides at CUA-VSL, and expertise with LAW glass composition models.  Energy Solutions, LLC, is the only source with th e required equipment and technical expertise to perform the work in the required timeframe.  
Unsolicited Proposals:All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.

<SUBJECT>Preliminary Analyses of the Falls Prevention Demonstration Program
<SOLNBR>12-233-SOL-00239
<RESPDATE>050512
<CONTACT>Sean D. Dalenberg, Phone 3014437077, Email sean.dalenberg@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Program Support Center on behalf of Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) intends to negotiate and award a contract to LifePlans, Inc on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p>The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) has an interest in addressing the significant knowledge gap concerning the effects of a falls prevention program on acute and long-term care expenses. <br />Falls constitute one of the most significant and common causes of injury and disability for the elderly. One in every three people age 65 and older living in the community falls during a year and fall-related injuries cost an estimated $17 billion annually. Falls are also associated with subsequent admission to a nursing home and use of long-term care services. While there are numerous studies identifying the major risk factors associated with falling (e.g., muscle strength/gait and balance, cognitive impairment, polypharmacy, and physical environment), there is virtually no research demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive programs designed to reduce the incidence and impact of falls.</p>
<p>LifePlans, Inc is the sole contractor conducting a demonstration based on the design developed in an earlier contract. The demonstration population is comprised of the private long-term care insurance policyholders allowing a unique opportunity to track acute care, post-acute care, and long-term care use and costs in a uniform way. Life Plans has agreements in place with the long-term care insurance companies to provide data on long-term care insurance claims by demonstration project participants. Life Plans, Inc. already has this data in hand for 50 percent of the sample, which will facilitate the analyses on the required time schedule.</p>
<p>Life Plan, Inc. is the sole contractor that can provide the deliverables proposed on the projected delivery schedule; which will require analyzing data that are being collected contemporaneously as part of the demonstration. In order for another contractor to conduct the analyses; Life Plans, Inc. would have to divert resources from the ongoing demonstration to produce an analytic dataset that a third party could use; which would most likely result in the insurmountable obstacles due to proprietary information and/or data rights. The obstacles resulting from proprietary information and/or data rights would prevent any contractor, other than Life Plans, Inc. from performing the work desired. Finally, Life Plan, Inc. is the sole contractor that possesses the personal identifying information that is required to create a finder file and link to Medicare claims data.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract type is firm fixed price and the anticipated period of performance is September 2, 2012, to September 1, 2103.</p>
<p>Contractors that may have the requisite qualifications must have the ability to perform the work described below and should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>The statement of capabilities must specifically demonstrate the contractor's ability to successfully complete each of the following items no later than January 1st, 2013:<br />1.Undertake a study of the impact of the Falls Prevention Demonstration Project on long-term care insurance claims<br />2.Obtain long-term care insurance company claims<br />3.Take all the steps necessary to link study participants' data to long-term care insurance claims data<br />4.Comply with all federal and state privacy regulations and <br />5.Use the linked data file to conduct analyses to evaluate the impact of the program on long-term care insurance utilization.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor shall conduct an initial evaluation of the effectiveness of the Falls Prevention Demonstration project using the self-reported data collected as part of the study. Analyses will include basic ANOVAs and t-tests to compare outcomes between groups, as well as multivariate analyses that will examine outcomes while controlling for individual participant characteristics. The contractor will also conduct analyses to determine which individual and behavioral factors are associated with a reduction in falls.</p>
<p>Finally, the contractor shall take all the steps necessary to link study participants' data to Medicare claims data. This process must comply with all federal and state privacy regulations. This process may include writing and signing a data use agreement, creating a protected finder file with individual identifying information, addressing any problems that arise, and obtaining a linked data file stripped of all identifying&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>No solicitation document is available. Capability statements should be sent electronically to Sean Dalenberg, Contract Specialist, at sean.dalenberg@psc.gov. Responses must be double-spaced and single-sided on 8.5" x 11" plain white paper, with 1" margins on all sides, using a standard font no smaller than 12 point. The response must be sequentially numbered, beginning on the first page after the table of contents. Responses are due May 5, 2012 by 5:00 pm. Responses will not be accepted after the due date. If no capability statements are received which specifically demonstrate the requirements above, the Government shall proceed with a sole source contract to LifePlans, Inc.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this action is to modify contract number N69250-07-D-0300 toextend the contract for up to 6 months as a "bridge" until the award of thefollow-on Pillar Solicitation N65236-11-R-0050 is awarded.  The Government willexecute a bilateral modification, pursuant to the authority of DFARS 217.204,to contract N69250-07-D-0300 in order to make this change.  DFARS 217.204provides authority to extend existing service contracts for up to 10 years,provided there is a Justification and Approval (J&A) to modify the contract forthe extension action.  The effort described herein will provide a continuationof support until the competitive action is awarded.  In accordance with FAR6.302-1(a)(iii)(A), these services may be deemed available only from theoriginal source (Eventure).  To award a follow-on contract for a period of only6 months would result in significant duplication of cost and effort that couldnot be recovered through competition.
This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  Anyresponses to this announcement should be submitted to the Contracting Officer,Cheryl.bruza@navy.mil no later than 11 May 2012.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Environmental Processes Branch (EP-P) has been tasked with procuring movement and location data of 30 Double-crested Cormorants to be captured and fitted with Argos Satellite Platform Transmitting Terminal (PTT) Harness Transmitters. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.106-1) with CLS America Inc., 4300 Forbes Blvd Ste 110, Lanham, MD 20706-4369, as the only responsible source that can provide the monitoring capability necessary to receive satellite transmissions, process the data, and present it in a meaningful format.<br><br>The following specifications are required to procure the location data for the satellites to meet the needs of this study:<br><br>a.	Capability of receiving transmissions from transmitting satellite tags that provide user defined signals to the Argos Satellite System, a global, polar-orbiting, satellite-based location and data collection system. These satellites pick up the signals from the on-ground transmitters (on the birds), store them, and then relay back in real-time to receiving stations. These stations then process the data and distribute back to the researchers.<br><br>b.	The satellites must be able to receive transmissions at 60-second intervals; only the Argos Satellite System provides such capabilities.<br><br><br>c.	The satellites must be able to receive transmissions in the 400-500 MHz range; only the Argos Satellite System provides such capabilities.<br><br>d.	Received location data for satellites must be processed through a Kalman Location Processing procedure. This procedure produces a statistically optimal estimate of locations in real time using a weighted average approach. Only CLS American, Inc., provides Kalman Location Processing as standard in the data collection capability provided by the Argos Satellite System.<br><br>e.	Satellite transmitters used to track cormorants are specially ordered and constructed to be monitored by the Argos Satellite System; no other compatible monitoring system exists.<br><br><br>CLS America, Inc., is the only company in North America that can monitor, process and disseminate data from the orbiting Argos Satellite System; this company is the only one that can meet the exact specifications needed for cormorants during the duration of our project (May - Oct12), and that will permit web access for downloadable movement data.<br><br>This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 518210 with a Small Business Size Standard of $25 million.

<DESC><p>The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) welcomes the Mentor Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program. The Department of Defense (DoD) Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program assists small businesses (prot&eacute;g&eacute;s) successfully compete for prime contract and subcontract awards by partnering with large companies (mentors) under individual, project-based agreements. Through this effort DoD provides incentives to major contractors to assist prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms and increase their overall participation as prime contractors and/or subcontractors. Mentors accomplish this by providing technical and development assistance to the prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Approved mentor firms will enter into mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements with eligible prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. A complete description of the DoD program and eligibility requirements is provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). Policy and procedures for the program, the list of potential DIA mentors and a copy of DFARS Appendix I can be found at the DIA-Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) website at http://www.dia.mil/contracting/small-business/guide_pilot.html</p>
<p>The DIA OSBP is seeking the benefits from this business relationship. Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements should be creative, unique, and capable of providing the necessary tools for a small business to support DoD and DIA's mission. The Agency is looking for industry support in the areas such as science and technology; software development; systems engineering; analytical services; and performance and program Management. Successful mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements provide a winning relationship for the prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the mentor, and the DoD.</p>
<p>The Phase I of the Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; process, executive summary for Fiscal Year 2012 is due by the end of 3rd quarter FY 12 or NLT June 30, 2012. The POC of the DIA Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; program is Ms. Sherry Baldwin, sherry.baldwin@dodiis.mil, 202-231-2166.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Anti-Embolism Hosiery. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) West is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is October 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Points of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-8537; and Cynthia Ingrao, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, cynthia.ingrao.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-8517.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Anti-Embolism Hosiery. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $356,717.06. This forecast is based on historical <br />usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, one hundred twenty (120) of the total one hundred fifty-four (154) line items represent the high used products and account for 94.1% ($335,582.70) of the total volume in sales $356,717.06 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-8537; and Cynthia Ingrao, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cynthia.ingrao.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-8517</strong>. The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.<br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. </strong></p>

Vendor must have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Anti-Embolism Hosiery, or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements.<br />9. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />10. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is an end product, IAW Trade Agreements Act. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System.</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation<br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00 PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. Six (6) pairs each of Anti-Embolism Hosiery listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites identified in the letters of invitation.<br />Item Description, Size<br />STOCKING ANTI-EMBOLISM THIGH LARGE REG 15-22MMHG SEAMLESS INSPECT TOE LATEX-FREE/SAFE<br />STOCKING ANTI-EMBOLISM THIGH MED REG 15-22MMHG SEAMLESS INSPECT TOE LATEX-FREE/SAFE<br />STOCKING ANTI-EMBOLISM KNEE LARGE REG 15-22MMHG SEAMLESS INSPECT TOE LATEX-FREE/SAFE<br />STOCKING ANTI-EMBOLISM KNEE MED REG 15-22MMHG SEAMLESS INSPECT TOE LATEX-FREE/SAFE</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately thirteen (13) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements<br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (Patient Safety/ The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Guideline #7-Reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections.) The measuring device and size chart must be easy to use. The accurate required measurement of the Anti-Embolism Hosiery is critical for selecting the correct size of the garment in order for the garment to provide maximum therapeutic effect.<br />2. (Efficiency of Use/Patient Safety/FDA Standard for Device Labeling - 21 CFR 820.120) The size, length and latex content of Anti-Embolism Hosiery should be easily identified from the packaging. Packaging that clearly identifies the size, length and latex content of the garment will assist the clinician in choosing the appropriate garment for each patient.<br />3. (Patient Safety/ The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Guideline #7.0 - Reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections). The Anti-Embolism Hosiery is easily pulled over the foot, ankle and up to the full length of the garment with minimal pulling and adjusting of the garment.<br />4. (Patient Safety/The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Guideline #7.0 - Reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections). The anti-embolism stocking will provide uniform/even compression and support.<br />5. (Patient Safety/The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Guideline #7.0 - Reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections). The garment edges that touch the patient's skin should be smooth, including the toe inspection opening.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). Among <strong>the products and sources that are determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>1352.209-74 Organizational conflict of interest.</p>
<p>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507-2(d), insert the following clause:</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

<p>Price: Evaluation of price shall be determined by reasonableness. Pricing submitted must reflect the offeror's understanding of the work.

Discounts or reductions of the negotiated rates must be clearly identified and are strongly encouraged. See the below Price Matrix as a sample format.</p>

A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br /><br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p><br />1. Agency and contracting activity:</p>
<p>U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN), 4000 Coast Guard Blvd, Portsmouth, VA 23703</p>
<p>2. Nature/description of the action being approved:</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard C3CEN Electronics Repair Facility (ERF) has a requirement for the purchase of an automated test platform to be used principally for troubleshooting and repair of the following circuit cards:<br />(a) 378' Class "Propulsion"<br />(b) 110' A/B Class "Start Panel"<br />(c) 110' C Class "Alarm" <br />(d) 110' A/B/C Class "Liquid Level Alarm" <br />(e) Assorted SRAN cards.</p>
<p>A second requirement dictates that this automated test platform be appropriate for any future work acquired by the A.T.E. section of ERF, and as such, must be expandable, flexible, powerful and well supported by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>3. Description of supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):</p>
<p>National Instruments PXI Test Platform and Software License IAW the Schedule B of the RFQ# HSCG44-12-Q-PCZ219</p>
<p>Total Estimated Value: $37,500.00.</p>
<p><br />4. Identification of the justification and the rationale:</p>
<p>This statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of authority cited:</p>
<p>This National Instruments PXI automated electronic tester is a replacement for our aging Schlumberger S-645 integrated/ combinational tester, and is the second PXI device which will replace our antiquated test platforms. Our existing Schlumberger S-645 machines are identical to each other, which means, the code written on one S-645 may be successfully deployed to all our Schlumberger testers with a high confidence of identical outcomes in all our circuit card tests. This same concept has to apply to any new PXI device we purchase-it needs to match the existing PXI system we obtained in 2010. Strange incompatibility failures could be introduced if we choose to use non- N.I. components and we could waste a lot of time and money troubleshooting the test device instead of troubleshooting circuit cards for the fleet. In an electronics troubleshooting, fault analysis environment, uncertainty introduced by the test equipment must be eliminated and replaced by the confidence instilled by a compatible configuration of like components- for example, any component "A" of PXI-1 could be immediately swapped for component "A" of PXI-2 with no difference in performance. Only by utilizing hardware and software from National Instruments are we guaranteed to have no configuration conflicts-allowing us to concentrate on our core mission of circuit card repair.</p>
<p>6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:</p>
<p>RFQ will be posted on FEDBIZOPS with the statement that any Contractor that feels they can provide the items as listed may provide a quotation</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will determine fair and reasonableness based on past purchase of similar or same items.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research:</p>
<p>Market revealed no other sources for the required items. National Instruments is the OEM.</p>
<p><br />9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:</p>
<p>The Coast Guard's decision to use the National Instruments PXI system was made in late October 2008, when LSU ordered a $41,000.00 PXI system. Upon the closing of LSU, we obtained this system from them via 1149, ordered the plug in modules and software needed to upgrade the unit to our specifications, and began to write automated tests for our circuit cards. We have been successful so far because National Instruments provides outstanding after- purchase support through their web site, discussion forums, regular software updates, engineer help lines and on-site tech assist visits. We believe we will be successful in the future because we buy test equipment that meets our needs today and will surpass our expectations tomorrow. The U.S. Coast Guard made a wise choice to invest in National Instruments products back in 2008, and we wish to continue ensuring future success by using the products which have proven to be successful.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:</p>
<p>None at this time</p>
<p>11. Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for supplies or services required:</p>
<p>None at this time</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification:</p>
<p>I certify that this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p><br />James A. Lassiter<br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p><br />13. Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel.</p>
<p>I certify this procurement meets the Governments minimum need and the supporting data which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief</p>
<p><br />Mark Wade<br />Technical Representative</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions:</p>
<p>- Quality of Product or Service<br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Schedule<br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Management of Key Personnel<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>

If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a</p>
<p>repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification.

Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Work Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COTR by the KO<br />8. Modification to Contract- The KS/KO will issue a modification covering all WR's</p>
<p>(11) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not <br />receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;</p>
<p><br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the Contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness.

<p>(13) CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p><br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of Clause)<br />(xii) FAR 52.212-5 -- Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (APR 2012)</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>Malm. I-3 WAWF Instructions<br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments.</p>
<p>To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact.</p>
<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988.</p>

<DESC>Military Combat Eye Protection (MCEP) <br>Sources Sought<br><br>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE OR PROPOSAL. This special notice is market research tool used to determine industry interest in the Eyewear Qualified Product List (QPL), assess the number and type of potential items likely to be submitted for evaluation, and to receive industry comments on the Military Combat Eye Protection (MCEP) specification. <br><br>BACKGROUND:  This notice is targeted towards vendors of protective eyewear (spectacles and goggles). Program Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM-SPE) is seeking potential candidates for the Army's Eyewear QPL to be established pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 9.2, as supplemented. The Government intends to publish the final MCEP Qualification specification, and seek applications for qualification of vendors on or about 28 August 2012. <br><br>In order to be considered for the Eyewear QPL vendors must be able to meet the qualification requirements as stated in the MCEP Qualification Specification.  The draft version of the specification is provided as an attachment to this notice and is intended to be used when evaluating candidates for the Eyewear QPL.  This draft MCEP Qualification Specification is for reference and industry comments only. Industry's comments to the MCEP Qualification Specification will be for the Government's consideration when compiling and establishing a final MCEP Qualification Specification.  The final MCEP Qualification Specification will update and replace the original specification established on April 16, 2010, which is also known as the Authorized Protective Eyewear List (APEL).   <br><br>Currently , the Government does not have a firm requirement in place where vendors are required to be capable of supplying "X" number of pieces. Historically, Government requirements have been for 40,000 spectacles and 20,000 goggles to be delivered within two to three months from date of award and the average monthly demand on some of the better selling eyewear products can be about 20,000 pieces per month.<br><br>Vendors who wish to qualify their eyewear products to meet the additional requirements of prescription eyewear users must satisfy both: <br><br>1.) the requirements of the MCEP Qualification Specification; and<br><br>2.) adapt their products to interface with the following medical item:  Universal Prescription  Lens Carrier (UPLC), NSN 6540-01-600-6532. <br><br>A copy of the UPLC product drawings and sample can be obtained by submitting a signed letter of request to US Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center, Attn: RDNS-WPW-P (M. Markey), Building 4, Room 218, Kansas Street Natick, MA, 01760-5019.  A non-disclosure agreement signed by an authorized representative of the company shall be required prior to the Government providing the drawings.  <br><br>Vendors that are interested in being qualified under the Eyewear QPL (with or without meeting additional UPLC requirements) shall submit the following information prior to the response deadline for this notice: <br>a.) Company name; <br><br>b.) Company address;<br><br>c.) Company business type(s) and percentages (e.g. manufacturing, research and development, etc.); <br><br>d.) Company's applicable NAICS code(s) with business size(s);<br><br>e.) Company's monthly sustainable production rate;<br><br>f.) Company's maximum production rate; <br><br>g.) Company's estimated time frame for first and subsequent deliveries;<br><br>h.) Company's primary point of contact for this notice (name, phone number, and email); <br><br>i.)   the number and type of products anticipated to be submitted for inclusion on the Eyewear <br>QPL; and<br><br>j.) Comments on the draft MCEP Qualification specification.<br><br>Be advised that qualified small business firms may, in appropriate circumstances, be provided with test cost assistance as required by FAR 9.204(a)(2) and subject to  availability of Government funds, for this effort.  Interested small business vendors should indicate whether they intend to seek such assistance, and provide any information that could bear on a determination as to whether to provide assistance under FAR 9.204(a)(2).<br><br>NOTE:  Any Proprietary Information provided in response to this notice shall include the following language on each sheet containing proprietary data: "These data are considered by the supplier to be submitted in confidence and furnished for the purpose of facilitating qualification testing and are not to be disclosed outside the Government nor to be duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate the product submitted for qualification testing. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in such data if it is obtained from another source."<br><br><br>Responses addressing these issues and questions should be submitted no later than 4:00 pm Eastern Time on 24 May 2012 to the contracting office point of contact (POC), Lisa J.

<DESC>Please note that this is NOT a request for quotes or proposals, the Government is seeking information for market research purposes only. The Government may or may not issue solicitation documents. The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA New York Harbor Healthcare System is conducting a market survey for qualified firms capable of providing a Definitive Electroporation System and its consumables as outlined below. Applicable NAICS Code is 532490 Other Commercial and Industrial Machinery and Equipment Rental and Leasing. Responses to this notice must be submitted in writing (email or fax is acceptable) and received not later than April 27, 2012 at 12:00PM. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

Description of Equipment:

Electroporation technology will allow Doctors to treat tumors in close proximity of vessels or biliary structures. Those types of lesions are generally not resectable and because of their anatomical location, are usually not amenable to treatment with microwave or radiofrequency ablation.
Definitive Electroporation on the other hand, will cause the death of the tumor cells within the area of its application, while preserving connective tissue and therefore saving vessels, bile or pancreatic ducts and other structures.
Definitive Electroporation will allow Doctors to target and treat patients with metastatic colo-rectal cancer, HCC and non-resectable pancreatic cancer that would otherwise receive only palliative treatment.  

The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (service disabled veteran owned small business, veteran owned small business, Hub Zone, 8(a), small disadvantaged business, small business, or large business) relative to NAICS Code 532490. For a Contractor to be considered one of the above socioeconomic classifications, they MUST conduct at least 51% of the work. 

Responses to this notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. Responses to this notice should include company/individual name, a service capability statement, examples of similar facilities which you have provided services to, DUNS number, address, point of contact and the size of your business pursuant to the following questions; (1) Is your business large or small? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emerging business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and if your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified Hub Zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned Small Business? 

Responses to this notice must be submitted in writing (email or fax) and received not later than April 27, 2012 at 12:00PM. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>AMENDMENT #1: Changed (c) to read April instead of August.<br /><br />**********************************************************<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.
<p><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611-Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a Market Survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below:</p>
<p>1.0 Background</p>
<p>The NLM Ethics Office within the Executive Office is responsible for management of the NLM Ethics Program. The NLM Ethics Office is charged with providing technical advice, support, guidance, and resources to the Library=s programs to implement the ethics policies, procedures and guidance promulgated by the NIH Ethics Program. This requires appropriate resources and staff with extensive ethics knowledge and the ability to translate that knowledge into useable resources for the NLM community.</p>
<p>2.0 Objective</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement is to provide technical and operational support to the NLM Ethics Office staff in its implementation of the NIH Ethics program requirements and the provision of timely and efficient ethics services to management and employees.</p>
<p>3.0 Scope</p>
<p>The work requirement covers all areas of the NLM Ethics program including data management via the use of the NIH Ethics Enterprise System (NEES) and the Ethics Management Information System (EMIS), and the evaluation of program implementation. Due to additional responsibilities, time constraints, and other workload requirements, the following services and products are required to support, maintain, and enhance the ability of the NLM ethics staff to provide ethics services to the NLM community.</p>
<p>4.0 Contractor Tasks</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not other&not;wise provided by the Government, to perform task assignments at the direction of the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) in the following Task Areas. All work shall be monitored and technically co-ordinated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>4.1 Task Area 1: Program Evaluation</p>
<p>In preparation for an external program review, the Contractor shall conduct a thorough internal review of the ethics program procedures, actions, and files for the purpose of evaluating compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and established NIH Ethics Office and HHS ethics policies and procedures as well as evaluating the use of the NEES system in the action review process. This evaluation will involve the review of physical files and electronic documents. The Contractor shall conduct the review and provide a written report of findings. Review will require approximately 40 hours.</p>
<p>4.2 Task Area 2: Program Activities</p>
<p>The NLM Ethics Office needs additional assistance during periods of high work load levels or difficult situations. For example, the NLM Ethics Coordinator may need assistance with a Contractor to review financial disclosure reports and outside activities, the development of written procedures, assistance with technical review of other ethics documents, review and preparation of responses to the Department and/or Congress, or conduct research for responses to ethics questions posed by management or employees. The Contractor shall provide assistance in the preparation of general ethics guidance when needed and in the technical review of ethics documents. In addition, the Contractor shall develop training aids and participate in employee training sessions as needed. This requires a vendor with extensive ethics knowledge, ability to provide succinct and correct advice, and time to work on special projects as they arise. This portion will be on an as needed basis but will require approximately 40 hours.</p>
<p>4.3 Task Area 3: Data Management Support (EMIS &amp; NEES)</p>
<p>The NIH Ethics Office requires that all data regarding ethics documents be entered in the EMIS system on an on-going regular basis. It is a high priority to maintain NLM's data in the EMIS database and enter new data as appropriate. The project requires a person knowledgeable in both ethics requirements and IT terminology and expertise in utilizing the system in order to quickly populate the database in an efficient and accurate manner. Vendor would be responsible for performing technical review of data, identifying and entering needed data into the system, reviewing data to ensure that correct information is entered, and working with NLM users to enhance their ability to use EMIS. As NIH continues to roll out new applications on the NEES system, the vendor may assist with new requirements of this particular system. This portion may take approximately 20 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 13. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.</p>
<p>(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement should contain enough sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities; however, the statement should not exceed ten (10) pages.</p>
<p>(b) The capability statement should include references, key personnel, and any teaming arrangements needed to fulfill the requirements. It must identify the responder's small business type and size; DUNS number; NAICS code; and technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>(c) All capability statements must be submitted electronically no later than 3:00 PM EST on Thursday, April 26, 2012 to Sheila Edmonds at sheila.edmonds@nih.gov.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>Confidentiality: No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine to modify an existing contract with Level 3 Communications, LLC, 1025 Eldorado Boulevard, Broomfiled, CO 80021, under the authority of FAR 6.302 for Internet Connectivity Services. NLM intends on extending the contract from 2/15/2012 - 6/14/2012. Vendors may identify in writing their interest and capability in response to this requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However all responses received no later than the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world's largest biomedical library and the developer of electronic information services that deliver trillions of bytes of data to millions of users every day. Scientists, health professionals, and the public in the US and around the globe search the Library's online information resources more than one billion times each year. Large data sets are also frequently exchanged among NLM and its research partners domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>The Office of Computer and Communications Systems (OCCS) of the National Library of Medicine provides efficient, cost-effective computing and networking services, application development, technical advice, and collaboration in informational sciences in support of the research and management programs offered through the NLM.</p>
<p>OCCS develops, operates, and maintains the backbone computer network and facilities, and supports, guides, and assists other NLM components in local area networking. The Division provides professional programming services and computational and data processing facilities to meet NLM program needs; operates and maintains the NLM Network Operations and Computing Facility; designs and develops software; and provides extensive customer support, training courses and seminars, and documentation for computer and network users.</p>
<p>OCCS helps to coordinate, integrate, and standardize the vast array of computer services available throughout all of the organizations comprising NLM. The Division also serves as a technological resource for other parts of the NLM and for other Federal organizations with biomedical, statistical, and administrative computing needs. The Division promotes the application of High Performance Computing and Communication to biomedical problems, including image processing and information security.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide high speed Internet connectivity to the National Library of Medicine's network which is located in Bethesda, Maryland. This will provide commodity Internet access to the public as well as the research and medical communities around the world. This connectivity needs to be provided via a Global Tier 1 Internet Service Provider (ISP). It must also include protected circuit connections from the ISP Point of Presence (POP) to NLM. These connections cannot be provided by the current ISPs that are presently being used by the Center for Information Technology (CIT) within the National Institutes of Health Network (NIHNET), since NLM uses the CIT/NIH internet connections as a backup. This connectivity must initially provide 2 Gbps bandwidth. The provider must have the capability to upgrade the connections up to 10 Gbps bandwidth.</p>
<p>Order HHSN276200700077P with Level 3 is scheduled to end 2/15/2012. In August 2012 the services were re-competed and an award was made to Global Crossing with contract HHSN276201100015C. Because of delays in the transition NLM intends on extending the order from 2/15/2012 - 6/14/2012.</p>
<p>The extension will give Global Crossing, the new NLM-Internet contract holder, additional time to install a new communications circuit for the upgrade of Internet services from a 2 Gigabit bandwidth to a 10 Gigabit circuit. Global Crossing has been delayed in installing the new circuit because of various reasons including: permit delays due to road construction in the area, delays in working with NIH networking groups to plan and coordinate cable installation on the NIH campus, and a Global Crossing corporate ownership change.</p>

<DESC>(2c) NOTICE - This and all request for information (RFI) and sources sought notice (SSN) postings to-date, for the anticipated CROWS AT requirement, have been for the sole purpose of market research--the gathering of information to help define requirement parameters and formulate a potential acquisition strategy.  The requirement statement/specifications and strategy will likely change, as a result of refinements implemented based upon input received thus far and in the future from all sources.  The Government's final acquisition strategy and requirement specifications (e.g. SOW, test specifications, drawings, etc.), should a solicitation for proposals be issued, will supersede all such documents used during these market research efforts.  An amendment to this posting will be made, as determined by the Government, with information regarding the next anticipated activity associated with the CROWS AT.  No response is required, as a result of this amendment.

<DESC>The S-69 Weir in Okeechobee and Highlands Counties, Florida is part of the Kissimmee River Restoration Project (KRR). The Project Description for the S-69 Weir includes the following:  design and construction of a steel sheet pile U-shaped Weir, earthen tie-back levees, concrete apron /access road, levee erosion armoring, channel backfill, site grading and incidental related work that will be depicted on preliminary drawings.  The S-69 U-Shaped Weir Project will backfill the C-38 canal just above the CSX Railroad Bridge in order to redirect flow into the historic Kissimmee River channel and rehydrate the upstream floodplain. Because the historic river channel has a much lower flow capacity than the C-38 canal, a passive water control structure will be needed in order to alleviate flooding onto lands outside the Kissimmee River boundaries that are not owned by the South Florida Water Management District. This control structure will be constructed at the downstream terminus of the C-38 backfill and will be a steel sheet pile weir which will be roughly 3'-0" above the existing local grade elevation. During storm events, the weir will spill floodwater into the remaining portion of the C-38 canal downstream of the weir.   The weir has been located at a safe distance upstream of the existing CSX Railroad Bridge in order to avoid potential scour of its bridge piers. In order to close the system and create the flood plain, earth tie-back levees will be provided between the downstream ends of the weir and the railroad embankment. A 14' wide unpaved road will be constructed along the crest of the levees on both banks of the river for maintenance egress. The access roads above the levees will be connected by a 16' wide concrete apron on the downstream side of the weir that will serve as both a roadway and erosion control.

The presentation shall engage Senior Executive Service (SES) members and equivalents in guided discussions which will enable them to understand their legal responsibility to maintain a discrimination free work environment; to know the benefits of making the EEO complaint process work within the VA; to encourage subordinate managers to engage in productive interactions when responding to EEO allegations and complaints; and to diffuse disruptive situations, workplace disputes and EEO complaints by using conflict management and alternative dispute resolution strategies.

This initiative provides a structure for delivering mandatory training to help promote equal opportunity and diversity within VA and provide VA Senior Executives with tools to help to resolve workplace disputes constructively in order to maintain a high-performing workforce.  

3.	Background
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is committed to ensuring equal employment opportunity (EEO), promoting diversity and inclusion, and resolving workplace conflict constructively in order to maintain a high-performing workforce in service to our Nations Veterans.  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has vocalized and demonstrated VAs strong commitment to maintaining a high-performing organization in the 21st century.  The Secretary is committed to vigorously enforcing all applicable Federal EEO laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and Management Directives to ensure equal opportunity in the workplace and full protection of all VA employees.  

The Department is staunchly committed to creating and maintaining an environment within VA that is free of barriers to full participation, that leverages diversity, and empowers every individual to contribute to his or her fullest potential in service to the Department and to the Nations Veterans.  In 2009, consistent with this effort, the Secretary announced to the Department Transformation 21.  One of the Transformation 21 initiatives addresses Human Capital Investment, and specifically states:  This VA-wide initiative helps offer the highest quality in medical care, benefits, and memorial services by creating a talent pool of trained, certified, and inspired employees. 

In support of Transformation 21 and in compliance with Title 5, U.S. Code, Section 3396,  which requires Federal agencies to establish programs for the systematic development of Senior Executives, the Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration (HR&A) mandated the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) in collaboration with the Office of Resolution Management (ORM) analyze, design, develop, implement and evaluate training and development activities for VAs Senior Executive Service in diversity and inclusion and equal employment opportunity (EEO) compliance.  

4.	Scope of Work
The scope of work is limited to updating a 3.5 hour interactive instructor-led training presentation that provides instruction on the Federal EEO Complaint Process, granting Reasonable Accommodation, Preventing Workplace Retaliation, and Maximizing the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution.  The presentation shall incorporate the technologies of an Audience Response System, video, voiceover scenarios, 3D animations, illustrations, Flash presentations, and interactive applications to garner the attention of participants and ensure the successful transfer and retention of information shared during the instruction.  The presentation shall also incorporate Knowledge Checks which will use an Audience Response System to measure learning and to gauge how well the participants enjoyed the learning process and the extent to which they gained knowledge and skills.  

5.	Place of Performance

Verification of a Security Clearance shall be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

D.  Custom software development and outsourced operations shall be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the Contractor shall state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

E.  The Contractor shall notify the CO immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the Contractor employ. The CO shall also be notified immediately by the Contractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

16. CUSTODY OF VA SENSITIVE INFORMATION

A.  Information made available to the Contractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the Contractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA.  (Rights in Data-General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1)).

B.  VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the Contractors information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling shall be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the Contractor shall ensure that VA information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VAs sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of Contractors IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with the requirements of VA Directives.

C.  Prior to termination or completion of this contract, the Contractor shall not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the Contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by the Contractor shall be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the Contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met shall be sent to the VA CO within 30 days of termination of the contract.

D.  The Contractor shall not make copies of VA information, logos, etc., except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on Contractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the Contractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies shall be appropriately destroyed. 

E.  If VA determines that the Contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the Contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

E.  Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the Contractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: 
(i) 	in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or
 
(ii) 	with VAs prior written approval.  The Contractor shall refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA CO for response.

F.  Notwithstanding the provision above, the Contractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.  If the Contractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that Contractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA CO for response.

17. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

A.  The term security incident means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The Contractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the Contractor has access.

B.

C.  With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate shall notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

D.  In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the Contractor shall concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The Contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The Contractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

18.  LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

A.	Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, this contract may require access to sensitive   
personal information.  Accordingly, the Contractor shall be liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any sensitive personal information the Contractor processes or maintains under this contract.


B.	The Contractor shall provide notice to VA of a security incident as set forth in the 
Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA shall secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

C.	Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach including the following:

(i)	Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);

(ii)	Description of the event, including:

(a)	Date of occurrence;
(b)	Data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;

(iii)	Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(iv)	Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(v)	Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(vi)	Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(vii)	The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
(viii)	Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(ix)	Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(x)	Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(xi)	Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

D.  Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the Contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:

(i) 	Notification;
(ii) 	One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(iii) Data breach analysis;
(iv) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
(v) 	One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(vi) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

G. In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function. For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the Contractor is considered to be an employee of the agency.

H. Operation of a System of Records means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the SOR, including the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of records.

I.

This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.

21.  ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS (SECTION 508)
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220) requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology (EIT), they shall ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities. Federal employees and members of the public who have disabilities shall have equal access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that enjoyed by non-disabled Federal employees and members of the public.

All EIT deliverables within this work statement shall comply with the applicable technical and functional performance criteria of Section 508 unless exempt. Specifically, the following applicable standards have been identified:

36 CFR 1194.22  Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications, applies to all Web-based deliverables, including documentation and reports procured or developed under this work statement. When any Web application uses a dynamic (non-static) interface, embeds custom user control(s), embeds video or multimedia, uses proprietary or technical approaches such as, but not limited to, Flash or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) then 1194.21 Software standards also apply to fulfill functional performance criteria.

36 CFR 1194.24  Video and Multimedia Products, applies to all video and multimedia products that are procured or developed under this work statement. Any video or multimedia presentation shall also comply with the software standards (1194.21) when the presentation is through the use of a Web or Software application interface having user controls available.  All training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agencys mission, regardless of format, that contain speech or other audio information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be open or closed captioned.  All training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agencys mission, regardless of format, that contain visual information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be audio described.  Display or presentation of alternate text presentation or audio descriptions shall be user-selectable unless permanent.
36 CFR 1194.31  Functional Performance Criteria, applies to all EIT deliverables regardless of delivery method. All EIT deliverable shall use technical standards, regardless of technology, to fulfill the functional performance criteria.

36 CFR 1194.41  Information Documentation and Support, applies to all documents, reports, as well as help and support services. To ensure that documents and reports fulfill the required 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria, they shall comply with the technical standard associated with Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications at a minimum.

Currently the piping is leaking into tenant space and buckets are in place to catch the water.We need to get this fixed ASAP and the work needed to be done after hours. The urgency of this situation requires the work to be awarded sole source to the on-site operations and maintenance contractor for $1914.72 above the contract repair threshold</p>

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  

Program Contracting Activity East - St. Louis
VA Medical Center, Bldg. 2
#1 Jefferson Barracks, Drive
St. Louis, MO  63125

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

EES Plans to contract under other than full and open competition for a firm fixed price award for a Firm Fixed-Price contract.  The proposed awardee is Audiology Online.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

This purchase is for the VA Audiologist to take online training with Continuing Education Credit (CEU) which is required to meet professional standards required to maintain the VA's certifications. Audiology online will provide access to 800+ commercial off the shelf (COTS) audio conferences with the VA Audiologist taking up to 432 on them per year. 	
Each course is priced at $99.00 per course with the VA taking a not to exceed 432 courses. 

The estimated cost of this proposed acquisition is $42768.00 per year for a total life cycle cost of $213,840.00.  This is a base plus 4 option years contract with a not to exceed 432 courses per year. 


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

a.  Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1) -

These training classes are proprietary classes and are not offered by any other vendor. This continuing education training is required for VA audiologist to retain their required certifications.  Purchasing from uncertified vendors would result in training materials that do not meet the standards of the professional association that supports VA audiologists, as required. 




6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Researched was done via GSA and Google. Research has shown that there are no vendors that can provide the required training courses to the VA.  IAW FAR 6.306 this justification will be synopsized 14 days after contract award.


7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The Price offered to the VA is the same price that is only offered to the company's preferred clients and is in line with training of a similar nature as the market research has shown. Previous awards to Audiology Online are as follows: C27037($42,768.00) and C07094($42,471.00)

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Researched was done via GSA and Google. Research has shown that there are no vendors that can provide the number required training courses to the VA. Please see attached market research which reflects the pricing information offered by the American Academy, however, their resources are very limited.

American Academy of Audiology;
	http://www.audiology.org/development/eaudiology/webseminars/Pages/default.aspx
Their library is extremely limited. They offer a limited number of courses This vendors 2012 CEU package is $99 - seminars are only offered 1-2 times  per month.  
Audiology Online
http://www.audiologyonline.com
Have over 800 courses for continuing education. Price for course is $99.00. Audiology Online offers weekly seminars and online training. 

Based on market research only one vendor meets the needs of the government, for online training, and that is Audiology online.  They offer more classes and are a small business concern. American Academy of Audiology is a large business. 



9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

While it is possible that another vendor could produce the training required it would take a considerable time and effort on the part of a vendor and would be cost prohibitive for the government to pay to have the training reestablished by another vendor when it is available via COTS.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

Market research will be conducted prior to exercising any options to ensure no other vendor has entered the market place or has developed the required training needed by the VA.


  



























12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
