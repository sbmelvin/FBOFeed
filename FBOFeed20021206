<CONTACT>George Hunt, 410-436-4192
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center (RMAC) is seeking qualified sources that can meet the requirements of an anticipated Firm Fixed Price contract for the production of Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS).  A Draft Request for Propos als (DRFP) seeking comments from Industry concerning the proposed acquisition will be issued on or about 31 Jan 2003.  The Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) is intended to rapidly and automatically determine the presence or absence of airborn e Biological Warfare (BW) agents and to identify the agent at the point where the system is deployed.  The functions of the JBPDS include monitoring the air for aerosol clouds of possible origin, sample collection and concentration, determine if the aeroso l collected is biological in nature, and identify the specific agent of biological origin, if present.  The JBPDS is designed to be used in the following configurations: Man Portable (XM96), Shelter (XM97), Shipboard (XM98), and Trailer (XM102).  The JBPDS  is comprised of several Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) including the Biological Agent Warning Sensor (BAWS).  This system has been developed to provide a common integrated biological detection and identification capability to US forces worldwide.  The Gove rnment anticipates that the Final RFP, with Firm Fixed Price Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs), will be issued under Full and Open Competitive procedures with a formal source selection board.  At this time, the Government intends to have the resulting con tract meet the requirements for 1,200 systems, First Article Testing, operating manuals preparation, refurbishment of test systems, and logistical support.  It is expected that options will be a part of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to c hange these requirements, as needed, at any time prior to contract award.  It is anticipated that a Level III Advance Planning Briefing for Industry (APBI) will be held for all interested parties on or about 25 Feb 2003. Any questions or comments that you would like addressed at the APBI must be received no later than 16 Feb 2003. Questions and comments received after that date will not be addressed at the APBI, but will receive a response at a later date. The final RFP will be issued on or about 21 April 2 003 and proposals will not be accepted until after that date. The Government will perform a performance risk assessment based upon the offeror's current and past record of performance either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor on previous contracts .  NOTE: Funding for this requirement is not yet available; therefore, the Government does not intend to imply that the release of this RFP will result in award of a contract. However, in anticipation that funding will become available, the Government plan s to solicit proposals to the final RFP and proposals will be due approximately ninety days (90) days after issuance. The SIC code for this acquisition is 3999.  For advertisement purposes, both the draft and final RFP are included in this announcement and  this will be the only announcement for the acquisitions RFP.  Offerors are encouraged to develop production teams consisting of both large and small business for subcontractors.  To request a copy of the DRFP, please contact  george.hunt@sbccom.apgea.arm y.mil via email.  No telephone requests for the RFP (Draft or Final) will be accepted. The acquisition will involve a requirement for both personnel and facility clearances at the SECRET level.

In the event no additional capable firms are identified through this synopsis, the Coast Guard will award a sole source contract. For Minority, Women Owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) has a program to assist minority, women-owned and disadvantaged enterprises to acquire short term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts. Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing. The maximum line of credit is $500,000.

<RESPDATE>011503
<ARCHDATE>04202003
<CONTACT>Maj Tonney T. Kaw-uh, Contracting, 781-271-2425
<DESC>This represents a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) that the Government intends to issue a competitive solicitation for the Battle Control System (BCS) - Fixed (Spiral 1) program, an open-architecture command and control system that will support strategic and tactical level battle management functions. The solicitation consists of a firm requirement for BCS-F and priced option, based on funds availability, for all other actions. The anticipated release of the solicitation is 16 December 2002. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and Pacific Command (PACOM) Air Defense Sectors (ADS) require an improved air sovereignty battle management system to:  a) provide an enhanced CONUS, Alaskan Area of Operations (AOO) and Hawaiian AOO air picture that includes both perimeter and interior sensor and data feeds from military and civilian sources, and b) replace legacy Region Air Operations Center/Air Defense Sector (RAOC-ADS) Automated Data Processing (ADP) Systems to include the AN/FYQ-93, the AN/GSQ-235 ROCC - Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Digital Information Link (RADIL) processor, the AN/FYQ-155, Advanced Interface Control Unit (AICU) processor, and the NORAD Contingency Suite (NCS). This effort is intended to provide surveillance and control of NORAD's and PACOM's AOOs (including Homeland Defense, which encompasses air sovereignty and aerospace defense missions, counter drug detection and monitoring operations), warning and assessment of aerospace attack, and response against air attack.  The mission requirements are on a 24 hours/day, 365-days/year basis.  BCS-F will process, integrate, display, and distribute data from sensors, data links, and other C2 agencies to maintain situational awareness and support air interdiction operations. It is anticipated that the role of the BCS-F (Spiral 1) will be extended to place greater emphasis on the monitoring of domestic air traffic as a result of the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001.  That extended mission and related requirements are not yet completely defined, thus the importance for the use of a Spiral Development process.  There is a potential for spiral development of this system for use in mobile Control and Reporting Centers (CRCs) and in possible bi-national applications. The Contractor will use Government System Capabilities Document (SRD) requirements as referenced in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) to determine initial spares, support equipment and Operational and Maintenance Technical Data. Training for operators and maintainers will be required to include training courses and training materials.  Training is required for pre-security accreditation as well as day-to-day operations. Reprocurement data will be included as an option to be exercised at the Government's discretion. Offerors will be required to have U.S citizen staff personnel with Secret clearances and classified facility and storage capability in accordance with the NISPOM (DOD 5520.22-M) by contract award.  Participation on this contract will be limited to US firms only.  An Acquisition Ombudsman, Colonel Jerry Corley, Director, Commander's Staff, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development.  You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired.  The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selections.  You can contact the Ombudsman at (781) 377-5106.  See Note 26.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. POC: Stephen L. Cannon, Contract Specialist, Code ACQ11.SC, Larry R. Fisk, Contracting Officer, Code ACQ11.  The Government will evaluate proposals using source selection procedures with the intent to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforms to the solicitation, as the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered. JOB DESCRIPTION: This quality of life project provides for the design and construction (Design/Build) of a 196-person dormitory at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. The work includes, but is not limited to, the demolition of the Base Exchange (BX), Building 4265 approximately 67,544 SF, (6,275 SM), and the construction of a new 196-person dormitory at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. Work includes all supporting utilities, site work, parking, and demolition of a segment of Douhet Drive. THE CONSTRUCTION SITE IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE UNTIL FEBRUARY 2004 (TARGET DATE FOR THE NEW BX TO BE COMPLETED AND THE OLD BX TO BE VACATED).  THIS PROJECT WILL HAVE TWO PHASES: A DESIGN PHASE WHICH WILL BEGIN FROM DATE OF CONTRACT AWARD AND MAY LAST UNTIL FEBRUARY 2004; AND A CONSTRUCTION PHASE WHICH WOULD BE BASED ON A START DATE OF ON OR AROUND FEBRUARY 2004 AND PROVIDE A MAXIMUM CONSTRUCTION TIME OF FIFTEEN(15) MONTHS. Estimated cost for design and construction is between $9,500,000.00 and $10,500,000.00. The work includes the preparation of design and construction plans and specifications and all other related construction documents for approval by the Government for a complete and usable facility. The project shall be designed and constructed using Sustainable Design Principles and an integrated team approach to provide a facility that (a) optimizes energy efficiency on a life cycle cost basis; (b) promotes occupant productivity and health; (c) utilizes construction techniques and materials that promote resource conservation and environmental responsibility-durable, recyclable, recycled content, locally available, minimize construction waste, etc.  These principles are further explained in the Navy's WHOLE BUILDING DESIGN GUIDE, located at http://www.wbdg.org/index.asp (currently under development).
Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately five (5) offerors (design-build firms or teams) based on equally weighted design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications, and Management Approach. Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project. The Phase II Technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the project; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of management, design, and construction. Price proposals will include total evaluated price, such as, evaluation of scope/design options within the Government's published budget for award. The Government reserves the right to: reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government. PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVUALUATE PROPOSALS AND SELECT PHASE II OFFERORS WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms. Proposers should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS OR DOCUMENTATION. The Government intends to issue the Phase I Request for Proposals (RFP) electronically by posting it on the NAVFAC website, http://esol.navfac.navy.mil, on or about 26 September 2002.

<SUBJECT>B -- Outdoor Testing and Monitoring of Thin Film Modules in Hot and Humid Climates
<SOLNBR>RDJ-3-33600
<RESPDATE>012703
<ARCHDATE>02112003
<CONTACT>Vicki Riddell, Senior Contract Administrator, Phone 303-384-7457, Fax 303-384-7397, Email vicki_riddell@nrel.gov
<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit responses from members of the photovoltaic community for outdoor testing and monitoring of thin film modules in hot and humid climates.  This RFP is in support of NREL?s Thin-Film Photovoltaic Partnership Program (TFPPP).  The purpose of the TFPPP is to accelerate the progress of thin film solar cells and module development as well as to address mid- and long-term research and development issues. The long-term objective of the TFPPP is to demonstrate commercial, low-cost, reproducible, high yield and robust modules having a stable, 15% efficiency. 
	
	The proposed work focuses on improving the stability of thin film modules by testing and monitoring the modules outdoors, in high-humidity and high-temperature conditions. Modules that will be tested are expected to be leading-edge prototypes being developed for commercial use. Module manufacturers will choose those designs (e.g., with or without frames, experimental edge seals, etc.) that are most likely to lead to greater insights into packaging issues.  (Modules will be provided at no cost.)  
	
	The purpose of this work is to establish a program to (1) test and monitor outdoors (at high temperature and humidity) sets of various types of thin film modules, (2) maintain these tests for the time needed to observe problems (up to 3 years), and (3) develop a testing and monitoring capability that can respond to further requests for similar tests.

Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be accepted only if submitted by a U.S. organization or U.S. company (incorporated and operating within the United States).  The proposed location for performance of the work must meet the following climate specification:  Humidity Ratio (weight of water vapor to air) of over 0.01.  

Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that one (1) to four (4) cost reimbursable subcontract(s) will be awarded with annual total funding availability of approximately $400,000 (not per award).  

The solicitation is available to view/download from NREL?s website at:

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market patented methods and processes for processing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN) in the formation of superbundles or for use in hydrogen storage using a solvent solution, as well as production of metal-doped SWCNs, and highly purified SWCNs. One of the processes for obtaining low cost SWNC s involves a unique hot filament technique developed at NREL. Also, NREL has successfully developed a technique for integrating SWCNs with microchannel heat exchangers. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research or CRADA program.  Information on technology transfer and patents available for licensing are available on the NREL web site at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/license.html.   
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must contact us (per below) by email or hard copy briefly describing the organization?s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and proposed use of the technology.  Do not include any proprietary information in initial contact.  Please contact us by January 31st, 2003, to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  A business or product commercialization plan will be required from the potential licensee during the negotiations.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market patented methods and processes for processing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN) in the formation of superbundles or for use in hydrogen storage using a solvent solution, as well as production of metal-doped SWCNs, and highly purified SWCNs. One of the processes for obtaining low cost SWNC s involves a unique hot filament technique developed at NREL. Also, NREL has successfully developed a technique for integrating SWCNs with microchannel heat exchangers. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research or CRADA program.  Information on technology transfer and patents available for licensing are available on the NREL web site at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/license.html.   
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must contact us (per below) by email or hard copy briefly describing the organization?s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and proposed use of the technology.  Do not include any proprietary information in initial contact.  Please contact us by January 31st, 2003 to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  A business or product commercialization plan will be required from the potential licensee during the negotiations.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The United States Army is placing greater emphasis on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) capabilities through the increased use of manned and unmanned sensors and sensor syste ms and payloads.  PM RUS is responsible for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and unattended ground sensors (UGS) and payloads for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).  PM RUS is collecting information on the numerous sensor and sensor system and payload types and  their capabilities available in the commercial sector (producible) and under development.  Understand that there are significant weight and volume limitations for UAV based sensors, therefore anything larger than 150 pounds or 68.4 kilograms or 3 cubic fe et or .057 cubic meters will be to large for our needs.  Also, UGS are normally man portable at or below 45 pounds or 20.52 kilograms.  Product Manager, Robotic and Unmanned Sensors (PM RUS) will use this information initially to develop a sensors and payl oads catalog based on their type and level of maturity.  As the Army's Operational Requirements Documents (ORD) mature, this catalog of information will be utilized to assess the sensor, sensor system, and payload types that are available to meet the Army' s requirements as well as identify efforts under development that may satisfy Government requirements in the future.  The Government is requesting two pages of information.  The first page of information provided by a potential offeror will be listed on th e PM RUS public access web site and in a published Sensors and Payloads Catalog.  The second page of potential offeror provided information will be for the US Government's internal usage only.  The catalog will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensur e it remains current.  This will be achieved by periodic requests for information, which will be posted via the Federal Business Opportunities Page.  If and when it is practical, PM RUS will purse the establishment of ordering and/or omnibus type contracts  with offerors to meet the Army's needs.  PM RUS will also share the general sensor, sensor system and payload information collected and any developed contracting capacities with other Army, Service and Agency offices that have similar requirements.

<DESC>NA The United States Army is placing greater emphasis on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) capabilities through the increased use of manned and unmanned sensors and sensor syste ms and payloads.  PM RUS is responsible for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and unattended ground sensors (UGS) and payloads for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).  PM RUS is collecting information on the numerous sensor and sensor system and payload types and  their capabilities available in the commercial sector (producible) and under development.  Understand that there are significant weight and volume limitations for UAV based sensors, therefore anything larger than 150 pounds or 68.4 kilograms or 3 cubic fe et or .057 cubic meters will be to large for our needs.  Also, UGS are normally man portable at or below 45 pounds or 20.52 kilograms.  Product Manager, Robotic and Unmanned Sensors (PM RUS) will use this information initially to develop a sensors and payl oads catalog based on their type and level of maturity.  As the Army's Operational Requirements Documents (ORD) mature, this catalog of information will be utilized to assess the sensor, sensor system, and payload types that are available to meet the Army' s requirements as well as identify efforts under development that may satisfy Government requirements in the future.  The Government is requesting two pages of information.  The first page of information provided by a potential offeror will be listed on th e PM RUS public access web site and in a published Sensors and Payloads Catalog.  The second page of potential offeror provided information will be for the US Government's internal usage only.  The catalog will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensur e it remains current.  This will be achieved by periodic requests for information, which will be posted via the Federal Business Opportunities Page.    If and when it is practical, PM RUS will purse the establishment of ordering and/or omnibus type contrac ts with offerors to meet the Army's needs.  PM RUS will also share the general sensor, sensor system and payload information collected and any developed contracting capacities with other Army, Service and Agency offices that have similar requirements.  Sen sor, sensor system, payload and program information is requested on the following sensor, sensor system and payload types and capabilities - Acoustic; Agile Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR); Airborne Minefield Detection (AMD); Biological Weapons Detection (BWD); Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN); Chemical Weapons Detection (CWD); Communications / Data Relay (CDR); Communications & Noncommunications Electronic Attack (CNEA); Communications Electronic Attack (CEA); Electro-Optic (EO); Elec tro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR); Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR) with Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD); Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR) with Laser Airborne Mine Detection (LAMD); Electronic Intelligence (EI); Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR); Foliage Penetration (FOPEN); Ground Surveillance Radar (GSR); Hyper-Spectral (HS); Imager - Daylight; Imager Infrared (Imager IR); ISR Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT); Laser Radar (LADAR); Laser Range Finder (LRF); Laser Range Finder / Target Designator (LRF/T D); Laser Range, Laser Indicator, Laser Designator (LD/LI/LD); Laser Spot Tracker (LST); Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR); Magnetic; Meteorological; Multi-Spectral (MS); Nuclear Radiation Detection (NRD); Passive Infrared (Passive IR); Radio Frequency ( RF); Seismic; Sense Through Foliage (STF); Sense Through The Wall (STTW); Signal Intelligence (SIGINT); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with Moving Target Indicator (MTI); Thermal Weapon Sight (TWS); Ultra-Spectral (US); Unco oled Infrared (Uncooled IR); and Urban/MOUT Advanced Sensor System (UMASS).

<SUBJECT>34 -- Side Connectors for the Improved Navy Lighterage System
<SOLNBR>N00025-03-R-0001
<RESPDATE>121602
<CONTACT>Robbin Bruce, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-685-6030, Fax 202-685-6048, Email BruceRS@navfac.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Sealift Support Program Office is seeking potential sources to manufacture Side Connectors for the Improved Navy Lighterage System.  This effort will include developing manufacturing drawings within 2 months after contract award, one (1) prototype Side Connector, First Article Testing (FAT) and any modifications to the Government furnished drawings to be conducted within seven (7) months after contract award.  This requirement will also consist of one (1) option for approximately 26 Side Connector units.  

The side connector(s) produced under this contract will be a major component of the Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS).  INLS is comprised of powered and non-powered floating platforms assembled from interchangeable modular components.  The INLS supports Logistics Over-the-Shore (LOTS) operations for Navy users.  There are three types of INLS modules: the Ramp Module (RM), the Intermediate Module (IM) and the Combination Module (CM).  Each module is 80 feet long by 24 feet wide by 8 feet deep and have flexible connectors to join two modules end to end.  Each CM is also required to have four side connectors per side.  The side connectors will allow the CMs to connect side to side with other modules in the Roll-on Roll-off Discharge Facility (RRDF) and Floating Causeway (FC) platform configurations. The side connector will fit inside pockets during the connection of CMs to make a rigid connection.  The system will be capable of operation in Sea State 3 and survive in Sea State 4 conditions.  

The side connector is a hexagonal steel box structure, approximately 38? x 33? x 96? that houses eight half-spheres at top and bottom for connection.  These eight half-spheres work in pairs and are moved inward or outward by hydraulic cylinders with controls at the topside of the connector.  Each half-sphere engages with a female socket that conforms to the shape of the half-sphere.  Female sockets are installed on the CM.  Objective is to use four side connectors to hold two CMs together side-to-side.  For each connector, all eight half-spheres engage the female sockets forming a rigid joint.  The hydraulic power is supplied via flexible quick disconnect hoses that connect to the top of the side connectors.

<DESC>The Department of State (DOS) has a requirement to provide Keyboard-Video-Mouse (KVM) switches for Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) at U.S. Diplomatic Missions overseas.  The DOS intends to establish a qualified manufacturers list (QML) for these KVM switches in anticipation of awards commencing no earlier than the late Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 timeframe and beyond.   

The standards that a KVM manual switch must satisfy are found in the following documents:
(a) NSTISSAM TEMPEST\1-92, Compromising Emanations Laboratory Test Requirements, Electromagnetics(U) (Confidential document).  This document establishes National Standards on the unintentional free space electromagnetic emissions from Information Technologies utilized in processing National Security Information (NSI) by DOS; and 
(b) DOS standard, DS-EQS-02.01, DS Red/Black Electrical Isolation Standard (Confidential document).  This documents establishes DOS values for electrical isolation between red (classified information) signals and black (unclassified information) signals.  
In addition to the standards represented in the two documents above, there is an additional requirement that KVM switch not allow HOTKEY keyboard keystrokes.  This requirement is critical because it shall preclude a user from accidentally switching between input data sources via keyboard activity.  

Before DOS will consider releasing a copy of the standards identified above or conducting equipment testing , a contractor must provide to DOS:
 1. A notarized certificates/certifications validating the following requirements:
(a)	The firm is a NSA TEMPEST Endorsed Manufacturer; and 
(b)	The firm is a NSA TEMPEST Endorsed Testing Facility.


2.	A cover letter with the following information:
(a) A reference to the Sources Sought Notice;
(b)	Point(s) of contact within your firm; 
(c)	Your firm's Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code;
(d) Your firm's cleared address to safeguard classified material at the "secret" level; and 
(e) The name, address and telephone number of your firm's Security Officer.
                   
The above information shall be mailed to the following address:
U.S. Department of State
ATTN:A/LM/AQM- Ms. Deborah Carey/(703) 875-4229
P.O. Box 9115
Arlington, VA 22219

If DOS subsequently determines a particular contractor has met certification requirements, DOS will prepare a DD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, which will address the safeguarding requirements of these documents.  The Contractor must comply with the stated DD254 requirements and failure to do so, would be treated as a Security violation.  However, it is important for all contractors to remember that to validate these certifications and prepare a DD-254, will take time, and the amount of time will vary for each contractor. 

DOS will perform in-house, all qualification and certification testing in support of this QML and it is anticipated that this testing will take approximately three (3) months in duration.  This testing will include TEMPEST and electrical isolation testing.  In order to support the testing, each contractor must provide a Manual KVM switch along with its supporting electrical and logic circuit drawings, including all testing documentation provided to the National Security Agency (NSA) and NSA certification identifying the switch is TEMPEST.  However, before the testing of any product can begin, the vendor must have an approved DD254 issued by DOS and an approved demonstration agreement.  A copy of this agreement may be obtained by sending a written request or e-mail request to the address listed below:

<SUBJECT>U--Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract to the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU)
<DESC>GovWorks, Procurement Operations Branch, U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, in support of the U. S. Department of State, Office of Public Liaison (PA/PL), is the contracting office for this procurement.  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Department of State recognizes the need for international awareness, understanding, and cross-cultural sensitivity in the wake of September 11th.  Institutions of higher education must foster greater dialogue about global issues and international affairs if American college graduates are to be well-informed citizens.  College graduates must be able to compete effectively in a global economy.  New partnerships between Government and higher education must initiate new strategies to create a cadre of American college graduates who can work in international affairs/public diplomacy, both within the Government, in various public agencies, and in the private sector.  The Department of State requires the cooperation of a nation-wide organization that represents an association of public colleges and universities across the country, which can provide the interface between the Department and the academic community.  Therefore, the U. S. Department of State will create a new project, entitled the Global Access Project (GAP).  The GAP will provide increased access to international content by making available the resources and staff of the U. S. Department of State.  The goal of the GAP is (1) to increase American students' understanding of international affairs and the work of the Department of State, and (2) stimulate interest in careers in the field of international relations and Public Diplomacy.  A variety of formats to accomplish project goals will be used, including in-person presentations by Department speakers on participating campuses, town-meetings for students and the wider community, week-long Washington foreign policy seminars for students, and digital video conferencing (DVC) and/or satellite technology.  The Faculty GAP Committee and Department of State staff, with coordination from AASCU, will develop programs to provide greater access for more American students to the Department and its wealth of resources on international relations.  The project offers the opportunity to create a series of modules and elements on a range of topics such as the craft of diplomacy, negotiating treaties, political, economic, regional and consular issues.  The program will be used to reach out of the broad range of interested persons on campus and from the greater community.  GAP campus coordinators will schedule smaller briefings for interested faculty, administrators, and the surrounding community.  The period of performance will be 24 months from award.  This requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior on behalf of the U. S. Department of State.   The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the American Association of State Colleges and Universities for this procurement.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services described above should provide their qualifications, in writing, to the Contracting Officer.  Such firms must submit supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the stated requirements.  This is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, the Government will consider all quotes received no later than December 10, 2002, at 2:00 p.m.  POC:  Jane M. Carlson, Contracting Officer, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be emailed to Jane M. Carlson at the following email address:  jane.carlson@mms.gov.  Telephonic questions or requests will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R -- Sole Source Notification - Services to Support Thermodynamics Research Center
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate with only one source, Dr. Xinjian Yan of Thornton, CO 80241.  NIST intends to procure Dr. Yan's services for expansion and enhancement of the Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) databases and software tools for thermophysical property data prediction using various group contribution and correlation models of organic compounds at NIST.  Other services to be provided include: (a)  Implementation of the TRC data quality assurance program    (b)  Preparation and modification of search options and the interface if necessary, of the annual updates of the following TRC PC databases and systems:  SOURCE, TABLE, COMPOUNDS and DENSITY    (c)  Combination of the developed procedures with software implementing Dynamic Data Evaluation concept developed at TRC    (d)  Preparation of the documentation describing developed computer codes and    (e)  Training of TRC staff in use of the developed procedures for the preparation of the updates of the TRC PC databases.  General skills involve computer programming and database design and management skills combined with extensive experience in chemical thermodynamics, thermophysics, chemistry and chemical engineering.  Specialized experience skills include demonstrated familiarity with the TRC database systems and in particular TRC SOURCE and other TRC PC data tools.  SOURCE is a major relational archival system developed and maintained by the TRC to store "raw" experimental data for thermophysical, thermochemical and transport properties of pure compounds, binary and ternary systems as well as chemical reactions.  SOURCE is also used as a powerful tool to produce various compilations and critical evaluations of data in both hard-copy and electronic forms.  The TRC currently maintains a master SOURCE database in Oracle format on a Unix server, and has been updating PC access to this information.  This database in its PC format is updated annually.  In addition, there are TRC TABLE databases for hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon systems that are updated annually. There are databases for compounds, vapor pressures, density and virial coefficients which are being updated as well.  TRC produces data books each year on special topics.  The databases contain information for approximately 16,902 pure components, 10,748 binary mixtures, 83,536 references, and a total of approximately 2.14 million records.  The TRC SOURCE database is the world's main repository for evaluated experimental data on the thermophysical properties of fluids.  It is the outgrowth of the database started in 1942 by Dr. F. D. Rossini at the National Bureau of Standards as part of the American Petroleum Institute Project 44 for the collection, evaluation and dissemination of property data on hydrocarbons.  The database was moved to the Carnegie institute of Technology in Pittsburgh in 1955 and then to Texas A&M University in 1961.  Currently, evaluated data are added at the rate of approximately 300,000 data points per year.  The types of data include the enthalpies of transition in condensed phases, solubilities and Henry's Law constants of organic compounds in water, virial coefficients of pure gases and gas mixtures, etc.  The databases can be used to find particular properties of specific substances, create lists of substances with sets of properties in specified ranges and perform virtual experiments on systems in an attempt to create fluids with particular properties. These are used in the chemical industry, the petrochemical industry and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as for specific applications related to aerospace, food science, environmental science, etc.  Dr. Yan has the current experience, expertise and the unique combination of skills to provide solutions for all services associated with the TRC requirement.  Dr. Yan has been involved in the development and production of the TRC data systems since 1999.  Dr. Yan is the main developer of the various TRC PC databases.    Dr. Yan has carried out most of the responsibilities related to the regular updates of such TRC data products as SOURCE data system, TABLE database, DENSITY database, Vapor Pressure database, COMPOUNDS database and others.  Dr. Yan has also previously participated in the development of a number of software products which have been used to enhance the existing TRC products. He has also developed a number of the software tools to analyze and implement various group contribution and correlation methods of prediction of thermophysical property data. The conventions for storing and describing numerical data values (intensive and extensive properties, variables of state, association of properties with phases, functional form of properties, state conventions, dimensions and units, data records and sets, data uncertainties) are unique to this database, but are quite familiar to Dr. Yan.  The scheme must be appropriately related to the 33 distinct tables that comprise the TRC Source database.  The implementation of the Dynamic Data Evaluation concept that TRC is currently working on requires expansion of the existing PC SOURCE data system to make the data available for their consistent simultaneous processing. This development makes it absolutely necessary for someone pursuing it to have deep knowledge of both TRC SOURCE data system structure as well as the structure and detail computer code comprising the TRC PC SOURCE data system.  Any lapse in the quality, continuity and schedule for the TRC data products would be detrimental to NIST and to the users of this information.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  No formal solicitation will be issued.  See Note 22.

The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS)for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

The evaluation will be based on technical and administrative capabilities of Offerors in relation to the needs of the Government and the reasonableness of cost in relation to the work to be done.

Technical proposals will be evaluated in terms of the quality and relevance or information presented.  The following factors, which are in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers:

Dates within the month of April

Past Performance

Cost proposals: Complete and submit Section1.

The Government will evaluate price on the basis of the total offered estimated price for providing all the services listed in this solicitation.  Technical merit is significantly more important than cost.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to a technically superior offeror who is higher in cost.  When technical proposals are evaluated as essentially equal, cost may be the deciding factor.

Award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose proposal is determined to offer the greatest value to the Government, considering primarily technical excellence, and secondarily cost/price, and other factors considered.
 
Contract award.  The Government may evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any and all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Ability to provide quality tabletop exhibits 
Ability to provide quality pipe and drape 
Ability to provide quality floor plans
Ability to provide quality signs
Past Performance

Offerors who include in their technical proposal a plan to hire welfare recipients for positions under a contract awarded resultant from this solicitation or who have established a company-wide plan for employment of welfare recipients, will be awarded bonus points in the evaluation of their proposal.

Cost proposals:

The Government will evaluate price on the basis of the total offered estimated price for providing all the services listed in this solicitation.  Technical merit is significantly more important than cost.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to a technically superior offeror who is higher in cost.  When technical proposals are evaluated as essentially equal, cost may be the deciding factor.

Award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose proposal is determined to offer the greatest value to the Government, considering primarily technical excellence, and secondarily cost/price, and other factors considered.
 
Contract award.  The Government may evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any and all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
