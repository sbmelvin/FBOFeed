<DESC>July 2011<br />MEMORANDUM FOR: ALL RENEWABLE ENERGY CONTRACTORS AND INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS<br />FROM: Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency<br />SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) for Air Force Renewable Energy Programs involving proven Woody Biomass [[BWD]] (Stoker Boiler / Bubbling Fluidized-Bed Gasified Boiler), Landfill Gas [[BLFG]] (Internal Combustion Engine, Microturbine, Gas Turbine, Fuel Cells) and Municipal Solid Waste to Energy [[BWTE]] (Stoker Boiler, Plasma Gasification) Technologies considerate of the best available pollution control systems.<br /><br />Description<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes. The Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency is seeking cost and capability information from interested parties concerning the matters described below for application at bases across the Air Force. The Air Force has taken steps to assess potential available BWD / BWTE / BLFG resources at or about Air Force military installations. <br />A cursory look at local resource data indicates that there may be opportunities for capturing Renewable BWD / BWTE / BLFG energy and developing various business arrangements to assist in meeting Air Force Energy Goals. Listed below are the sites under consideration for Biomass developments along with recent rates:<br /><br />Air Force Base State Command Technology Potential Capacity** Recent Rate* ($/kWH) Central Heating Plant on premises?<br />Kirtland Air Force Base NM AFMC BWTE 50.2 MW 0.073 No<br />Tinker Air Force Base OK AFMC BWTE / LFG 46.9 MW 0.056 Yes (1)<br />Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH AFMC BWTE 15 MW 0.054 Yes (2)<br />Buckley Air Force Base CO AFSPC LFG 23 MW 0.060 No<br />Kessler AFB MS AETC BWTE 16.4 MW 0.085 No<br />Scott Air Force Base IL AMC BWTE / BWD 15.2 MW 0.109 No<br />Tyndall AFB FL AETC BWTE / BWD 14.6 MW 0.092 No<br />Eglin AFB FL AFMC BWD 25 MW 0.104 No<br />Sheppard AFB TX AETC BWTE / BWD 14.4 MW 0.084 Yes (3)<br />Maxwell AFB AL AETC BWTE / BWD 19.2 MW 0.071 No<br />Cape Canaveral AFS / <br />Patrick AFB FL AFSPC BWTE / BWD 13.6 MW 0.067 No<br />Travis AFB CA AMC BWTE 13.2 MW 0.068 No<br />McGuire AFB NJ AMC BWTE / BWD 9.1 MW 0.104 No<br />Luke AFB AZ AETC BWTE 9.1 MW 0.067 No<br />Laughlin Air Force Base TX AETC BWTE / BWD / LFG 4.8 MW 0.097 No<br />Homestead Air Reserve Base FL AFRC BWTE / BWD / LFG 2.4 MW 0.103 No<br />Westover Air Reserve Base MA AFRC LFG / BWTE / BWD 2.7 MW 0.111 No<br />Holloman AFB NM ACC BWTE 7.8 MW 0.079 No<br />Davis Monthan AZ ACC BWTE 10.3 MW 0.072 No
<p>*Capacity and Recent Rates here shown consist of averages from Calendar Year 2009 or 2010. <br />** Capacity here shown is the minimum capacity the USAF estimates could be sustained through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Extended Use Lease (EUL)/PPA combos may also be entertained and possibly harvest greater capacities if local market demand and conditions allow: and, if sufficient land area is available at the installation to host each project.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this BWD / BWTE / BLFG Energy Generation RFI is twofold: first to identify market viable concepts that have the potential to create and grow long-term public-private partnerships through economically viable*** renewable energy projects on Air Force installations in the continental United States, Hawaii, Alaska and US Territories; and second, to identify qualified private sector developers, utilities, and/or development entities with an interest in developing renewable energy projects on Air Force land. <br />***Economically viable renewable energy projects are considered as projects that may provide "just as" or "less" expensive energy rates than recent rates at specified USAF installations. Alternatively an economically viable renewable energy project is also considered to be a project that may guaranty "just as" or economic savings to the USAF over its life from a net present value perspective considerate of thoroughly assessed forecasts and risks. Economic savings that may be achieved by offsetting current energy consumption either through cogeneration or others efficient means will also be considered viable.<br />The objectives of this RFI are derived from a broad set of Air Force energy goals and operational cost savings mandates. They include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&#61607; Reduce Demand: The Air Force is committed to reducing installation energy demand. <br />&#61607; Increase Supply: The Air Force is committed to increasing energy supplies, utilizing renewable and alternative energy where possible, to enhance energy security and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Air Force goal is that 25% of all facility energy be from renewable sources by Fiscal Year 2025.<br />&#61607; Cost Avoidance: The Air Force is mandated to reduce or eliminate operations costs for the repair, replacement, and/or investment in energy generation infrastructure.<br />&#61607; Revenue Generation: Air Force asset management strategy seeks to optimize non-excess assets through the development of renewable energy projects, where mutually beneficial to the Air Force, external installation community, and private developers.<br />The mechanisms to implement public-private partnerships utilized by the Air Force to achieve these objectives can take many forms. Development concepts can include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&#61607; Renewable Energy Power Purchase Agreement (REPPA). Under the authority of 10 USC 2304 and 40 USC 113(e) (3), the Air Force purchases power from on-base renewable energy generation projects. Project size is determined by installation demand. The Air Force is the power offtaker. Solicitation is accomplished via a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>&#61607; Enhanced Use Lease (EUL). Under the authority of 10 USC &sect; 2667, the Air Force leases land to a developer, utility, or other entity to develop a renewable energy project on an installation for which the market is the power offtaker. Project size is determined by market demand and installation renewable resources, possibly augmented by surrounding community resources. Solicitation is accomplished via a Request for Qualifications (RFQ).</p>
<p>&#61607; EUL/PPA Combination. This project type is in a concept development phase at this time. A EUL/PPA maximizes the market potential of a EUL with the benefit of the Air Force being a limited offtaker of the power produced via a power purchase agreement. Each vehicle is mandated under separate authority as listed above under EUL and PPA respectively. Solicitation process to be determined.</p>
<p>&#61607; Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC). Under the authority of 10 CFR 436 Subpart B, the Air Force may enter into shared-energy savings contracts with private-sector energy service companies (ESCOs) to increase the energy efficiency at a facility. The ESCO designs and constructs a project that meets the agency's needs and arranges the necessary financing. The ESCO guarantees that the improvements will generate energy cost savings sufficient to pay for the project over the term of the contract. ESCO funded improvements are paid through a share of the savings resulting from the energy efficiency. Solicitation is accomplished via a RFP.</p>
<p>&#61607; Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESC). Under the authority of 10 USC Section 2913, the Air Force participates in utility energy efficiency programs. In a UESC, a utility arranges financing to cover the capital costs of the project, which are repaid over the contract term from cost savings generated by the energy efficiency measures. Solicitation is accomplished via a RFP.</p>
<p>&#61607; Other. The Air Force is open to any new and innovative strategies and project concepts which can help the Air Force to meet its energy goals and operational cost savings mandates. <br />Based on the Air Force's energy goals and objectives, and its unique non-excess asset portfolio in or adjacent to markets with significant renewable energy development and or potential, we believe there is a unique opportunity for market makers to partner with the Air Force to create value for all--a win-win business proposition.</p>
<p>Industry Engagement <br />This interaction with Industry organizations has been initiated following the AF Renewable Energy Industry Day held in Irving, TX on 8 December 2010. A series of RFIs to gain additional specific input will be focused on separate areas of the renewable energy spectrum. This RFI is focused on BWD / BWTE / BLFG generation and the concepts of distributed generation. With distributed generation, the energy produced would first be used in the host building or area. Responses on these topics may be presented in combination or in separate concepts. <br />The following RFI's will be posted to FedBizOpps.gov in approximately four week intervals to allow control of the RFI review and evaluation workload. General planning is to move through the Focus Areas in the following order, subject to adjustment and change. <br />Woody Biomass (BWD)<br />Large Solar (&gt;750 kW)<br />Waste to Energy with Municipal Solid Waste (BWTE)<br />Landfill Gas (BLFG)<br />RFIs previously been posted to FedBizOps.gov were for Small Wind, Geothermal, Small Solar (&lt;750 kW), and Large Wind (&gt;500 kW). <br /><br />Concepts and Proposals<br />Please include in your response to this Request for Information, detailed information pertaining to the following areas:</p>

<CONTACT>Ahmed Hemdan Ahmed.Hemdan@Hanscom.af.mil

<a href="mailto:Ahmed.Hemdan@Hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract.  The Department of the Air Force, HQ ESC/HNAC, Ground Systems Branch, TACP-M, plans to award a Cost Plus Fix Fee (CPFF) contract to Vectronix, Inc., 29 Piscataqua Drive, Newington, NH 03801 to provide continued maintenance and upkeep of the PLRF-15C kit.
The purpose of this effort is to provide continued maintenance and upkeep of the PLRF-15C, a kit which is critical to the TACP overall mission, following the completion of the standard warranty.  The primary mission of TACPs is to advise their respective ground commanders on the capabilities and limitations of air power and assist the ground commander in planning, requesting, and coordinating Close Air Support (CAS). The PLRF-15C capabilities allow TACP personnel to accurately identify targets on the ground and relay that information to aircraft or higher headquarters which may result in weapons release on a target.  The PLRF-15C is a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) product.  Since procurement of the product has been completed, a requirement remains for continued hardware and software support as user requirements change.
The Government requires Interim Contractor Support (ICS) for the PLRF-15C as described.  The Contractor shall provide technical support, software engineering, documentation (monthly and cumulative metrics such as failure modes, mean time to repair and/or other metrics as appropriate), and field support as needed to sustain the 984 fielded PLRF-15C kits.  The Contractor shall maintain a pool of five percent spares, to be provided by ESC, to draw from as immediate replacements to incoming equipment in order to minimize loss of mission capability.  The Contractor shall inspect, troubleshoot, repair, and test PLRF-15C kits upon receipt and return to a fully functional status and replace units that were drawn from the spare pool.  Upon completion of the contracted work effort, the Contractor shall return any and all remaining spare equipment to ESC.  The Contractor shall update all software/firmware the PLRF-15C kits that are returned for maintenance.  The Contractor shall be res! ponsible for CONUS/OCONUS shipping and receiving of PLRF-15C kits.  The period of performance will be twelve (12) months, with two additional twelve (12) month option Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN).
The Government requires that the Contractor perform management functions (including administrative, technical, and financial activities) and maintain status of their efforts toward achieving contract objectives.  The Contractor shall establish, maintain or utilize their own proven program management practices to manage all technical performance, cost, schedule, and contract data delivery requirements throughout the period of performance.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 8), with Sirona Dental Systems, 4835 Sirona Drive, Suite 100, Charlotte NC 28273, as the only source that can provide Dental Digital Impression Units under VA Schedule # V797P-3170M. Sirona is the only vendor on the Federal Supply Schedule that can offer a unit that allows the patient's mouth to be scanned directly, instead of requiring a physical impression to be taken and then digitally scanned in an acquisition unit. If a unit were acquired that requires a physical impression, dental impressions would have to be taken, cured, and then scanned and digitized before being sent to a milling unit to create the dental prosthetic. This adds hours to a procedure and requires a patient to return on a separate occasion for treatment. Being able to digitally scan directly from a patient's mouth allows the entire procedure to be completed in a single visit. Sirona is the only vendor that can meet the minimum requirements of the government. The open market items intended to be purchased are as follows: Item # 6149566 - CEREC 3D On-Site Training, 6149590 - CEREC Blocs Starter Sets, 88888888 - OptiSpray 50 ML 12 Pack (50 Nozzles), 6284074 - Computer inEos Blue, 6042548 - Monitor, 6149640 - inLab inEos On-Site Training, 6149608 - inCoris Starter Blocks Set, 6133917HS - inFire HCspeed Sintering Oven, 88888888 - OptiSpray 200 ML 12 Pack (50 Nozzles). This acquisition is being conducted under FAR 8.404. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received within 7 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Arjun Bhalla at arjun.bhalla@med.navy.mil. Statements are due by COB July 25, 2011. No phone calls accepted.

<a href="mailto:Frank.Bennett@boemre.gov">Frank.Bennett@boemre.gov</a>
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This pre-solicitation notice is being issued in accordance with FAR Part 5.204.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), intends to competitively award a contract entitled Identify Information Needs and Data Gaps on the Effects to Fish, Fisheries and Invertebrates in the U.S. Atlantic and Arctic from Sound-Generating Activities by the Energy Industry.  The BOEMRE Procurement Operations Branch is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price type contract for the effort described herein but may consider other proposed types if determined appropriate.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, and the work is multi-disciplinary.   The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be not more than 18 months.
BACKGROUND:  The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and supporting regulations necessitate the collection of information needed to assess impacts from activities authorized by BOEMRE.  This includes an analysis of effects to fish, fisheries and invertebrates (that are commercially and recreationally important, threatened or endangered, or keystone species) from sound-producing activities.  There are also several other environmental statutes which require BOEMRE to consider carefully the potential impacts to these resources, such as the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  Oil and gas exploration, sand and gravel resource assessment, future offshore wind turbine placement, and other renewable energy projects will include noise-producing operations (e.g., seismic exploration, pile driving, drilling, vessel noise) and any potential impacts from these activities on fish, fisheries and invertebrates must be analyzed under these respective statutes. 
Biological impacts and impacts to commercial and recreational fisheries in both U.S. Atlantic and Arctic waters from anthropogenic noise have been identified by BOEMRE as important topics needing additional information.  There are gaps in the available information regarding the effects of BOEMRE-regulated sound-producing activities on fish, fisheries and invertebrates which make it difficult to evaluate impacts.  BOEMRE proposes to sponsor a workshop to gather relevant experts and stakeholders to identify data gaps and discuss scientific approaches for addressing these gaps.  The products of this effort will be a literature synthesis, a meeting report, and a data gap analysis.  The results of this workshop will be used to better inform BOEMRE and other regulatory agencies in their decision-making and environmental analysis processes evaluating oil, gas and mineral production as well as renewable energy and alternate use on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  This workshop also will serve in developing avenues of communication and collaborative relationships with experts on fish, fisheries, invertebrates and acoustics from other Federal agencies, affected State and local groups, industry, as well as representatives from other countries.  
SCOPE OF WORK:  
The study is expected to:  (1) Identify and prioritize data and knowledge needs across disciplines and geographic areas with respect to OCS energy and minerals issues and the effects of sound on fish, fisheries and invertebrates in the U.S. Atlantic and Arctic oceans; (2) Discuss the effectiveness of the various scientific research methods and approaches which might be used in addressing knowledge gaps; (3) Foster collaboration among federal and state agencies, industry (both energy and commercial fisheries), academia, and representatives from other countries, in addressing these information needs; and (4) Produce a literature synthesis, a meeting report and a data gap analysis.
HOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT:  If your organization is interested in participating in this acquisition, please send your organizations name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, and DUNS Number via email to Frank.Bennett@boemre.gov or via U.S. Mail to Frank Bennett, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, Procurement Operations Branch, MS-2101, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, Virginia 20170, by 8:00 a.m. Monday, 25 July 2011.  Those organizations expressing an interest in this opportunity will receive a copy of the complete solicitation upon issuance.  Reference Solicitation No. M11PS00081 on all correspondence. TELEPHONE INQUIRIES ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.
<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Ionoptix Corporation, 309 Hillside Street, Milton, MA, 02186 for the purchase of an Ion Optix fluorescence imaging system. The vendor is to provide a fluorescent ion imaging system with integrated length and sarcomere measuring capability, including installation and training. The system is to include measurement capabilities for both dual-emission and dual excitation fluorescent dyes, field stimulation and thermostatic temperature control of sample. Simultaneous measurement of cell length by edge detection and sarcomere length is required. System is to be integrated on vendor supplied inverted microscope with vibration isolation. The software and hardware are proprietary, and are not available except from manufacturer. The proposed system replaces in-house designed and built (in 1987) systems which are no longer serviceable due to loss of key personnel. The ion optix system is similar to the in-house system as published in : Spurgeon, H.A., Stern, M.D., Baartz, G., Raffaeli, S., Hansford, R.G., Talo, A., Lakatta, E.G., and Capogrossi, M.C.: Simultaneous measurements of Ca2+, contraction and potential in cardiac myocytes. Am. J. Physiol. 258: H574-H586, 1990. Over 100 papers have been published by the lab using this in-house system. It is in the best interest of the Government to match as closely as possible the capability of the replacement system to this original system to provide optimal comparability of the data. This is a proprietary system for measurement primarily of calcium ions in live cell imaging. This is the only system designed to permit true simultaneous measurement calcium or other ions by fluorescence with measurement of cell contraction and sarcomere length thereby providing the ability to relate changes in ion concentration with cell response (contraction) at a millisecond time resolution. In addition, this system will use the dyes Indo-1 or Fluor-4 which have unique properties required by our experimental tasks. Other systems use cuvette or plate reader sampling which does not permit measurement of a single isolated cell and certainly does not permit measurement of simultaneous electrophysiology parameters from the live cell.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest, San Diego, California, is preparing to release a Request for Proposal for a Small Business Remedial Action Contract (SB RAC) for Environmental Remediation Services at various Navy and Marine Corps Installations in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.  The majority of the work is anticipated to be in California.  The resulting contract will be a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a ceiling of $100,000,000 for a base period of one year and four one-year option periods.  This procurement is set-aside 100% for small business.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services, with a size standard of 500 employees.

This contract will focus primarily on environmental restoration projects, but could involve other environmental work such as compliance projects.
  The services to be provided may include actions such as, but not limited to, the following:  performing remedial actions; performing removal actions; performing expedited and emergency response actions; performing pilot and treatability studies; providing facility operation, maintenance, and instruction; performing range cleanup and closure, including range sustainability; providing environmental program assessment; performing RCRA closures; performing site characterizations; performing groundwater characterization studies; and performing other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels.

The contaminants will include, but not be limited to, those identified and regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA); and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).
  A relatively small number of sites may require remediation of radiological or ordnance waste or unexploded ordnance (UXO), discarded military munitions (DMM), or munitions constituents (e.g., TNT, RDX).  The included contaminants are predominately solvents, POL, metals, acids, bases, reactives, non-explosive ordnance residues or compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides.  Contaminants may be present in soils, sediments, groundwater, air, sludge, surface water, and man-made structures.  Contaminated sites may be landfills, hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities, tanks, lagoons, fire fighting training areas, or other facilities.

Formal source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 will apply to this acquisition.
  The Government intends to make a single contract award to the qualified and responsible offeror providing the best overall value based on price and non-price factors.  Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001 is a remedial action at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Old Town Campus, Naval Base Point Loma, Installation Restoration Program Site 1, San Diego, California.  The Government intends to award PTO 0001 with the base contract, but reserves the right not to award PTO 0001 or to award it at a later date.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
  The minimum guarantee of $25,000 will apply to the entire five-year term of the contract.  The aggregate value of task orders issued under the contract will not exceed $100,000,000.  The task order range for this contract will be $150,000 to $3,000,000.

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors:  Factor 1  Specialized Experience; Factor 2  Safety; Factor 3  Contract Management; Factor 4  Technical Approach (PTO 0001); Factor 5  Past Performance; and Factor 6  Cost/Price.  Factors 1 through 5 are of equal importance to each other.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1 through 5 combined are significantly more important than Factor 6.  Proposals will be evaluated to determine the proposal most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation factors.
  Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.

A pre-proposal site visit/meeting for the PTO 0001 project is scheduled for 9 August 2011 at 8:00 AM local time.  All attendees will meet at NAVFAC Southwest, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92132 and will be taken by bus to the location of the site visit/meeting.

  Date of birth and passport number must be provided for foreign nationals.  Due to space limitations, each firm is limited to two (2) representatives.  Further details will be provided in the solicitation.  Costs associated with participating in the pre-proposal site visit/meeting or responding to the solicitation will not be compensated.

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Frontier GeoSciences, Inc of Seattle, Washington for Frontier Atmospheric Dry Deposition (FADD) samples, associated equipment, analysis and sampling training for reactive gaseous mercury (RGM). The US EPA believes that Frontier GeoSciences Inc. is the only commercial source known to have developed a method for the passive collection of reactive gaseous mercury (RGM).  Frontier developed the Frontier Atmospheric Dry Deposition (FADD) membranes which are deployed on trace-cleaned aerodynamic sampler heads (to minimize turbulent flow over the membrane surface) and upside down (to minimize exposure to solar radiation, rainwater and large particle deposition) and the method to analyze the samples once collected.  Because they are passive samplers, there is virtually no possibility of equipment breakdown that could result in significant data gaps.  Furthermore, non-t echnical personnel can be easily trained to remove the samples for shipment to Frontier for analysis.  The period of performance is expected to begin August 2011 and continue for 12 months. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist; therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available at this time.  Consequently, any response failing to address the aforementioned qualifications and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who believe they can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capabilities, no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit your responses via email to Heather R. Pinney at pinney.heather@epa.gov.  Telephone calls will NOT be accepted.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source Purchase Order with Dialog LLC of Morrisville, NC for a literature search service with one year of subscription access. plus 4 option years to Dialog's databases.The EPA believes that the Dialog ProQuest Corporation is the only source capable of providing this database access.  The EPA library staff needs access to a collection of databases covering agriculture, business and industry news, chemistry, company directories, energy and the environment, engineering and technology, food science and nutrition, market research, medicine and biosciences, news and magazines, patent, trademark and copyright, pharmaceuticals, product information and social science and humanities.  The service must offer selective field searching across one or more of these databases simultaneously using a specialized language that allows the librarian to produce records that are targeted to the specific research and discovery needs of EPA scientists, policy-makers and managers.  This service must also provide links to full-text articles and allow for tagged output for use in post-processing software.Since this procurement is being considered a commercial service, simplified procurement procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 13.5.  The base period of performance for this order is expected to be 10/01/11 through 09/30/12.  All interested parties who believe that they can provide these required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any other sources exist and, therefore, no Request for Quote (RFQ) is available at this time unless the interested party provides the aforementioned information.  Consequently, any responses that fail to provide the aforementioned information and instead request a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Submittals should be made to Christopher Davis (919-541-4609) via email at davis.christopher@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Munitions Directorate Advanced Guidance Division (RWG) is currently managing efforts to develop and test GPS anti-jam navigation technologies. As part of this effort, RWG is seeking industry information on real-time closed-loop GPS simulation capabilities for Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) anti-jam systems. The requirements are described below:<br /><br />1. The capability is required to perform wavefront generation for a 7 element CRPA system on a vehicle maneuvering under closed-loop control in 6 degrees of freedom. A typical simulation scenario would involve a weapon INS/GPS connected to the GPS simulator, the output of the navigation system would feed a seeker and avionics package on a motion simulator. Actuation commands would drive a simulation of the weapon dynamics which in turn would drive the GPS simulator and flight motion simulator. Numerous test environments could be envisioned for ground and space based support components, including the need for operation in complex urban environments. <br /><br />2. GPS simulation technologies are required to test weapon guidance and navigation solutions under a variety of conditions. These conditions may temporarily disrupt or degrade GPS reception. The ability to replicate global positioning constellation signals, jamming signals - including intentional disruption (large numbers of jammers with very high target J/S levels) and environmental effects, in a real-time hardware-in-the-loop environment is required. The ability to replicate self-induced and naturally occurring environmental effects is desired, e.g., ionosphere, scintillation and multi-path scattering models. The simulator should be capable of operation in a real-time hardware-in-the-loop environment interfacing with closed-loop weapon simulations, e.g., state data would drive the GPS simulator through a SCRAMNet GT run-time interface. The simulator would in turn, present GPS signals affected by the described environmental influences. Latencies of 10 milliseconds or less and updates rates of 100Hz or more are desired. Both digital and RF outputs are necessary for facility data collection and simulation. In addition to GPS (L1, L2 (C/A and Y codes)), the ability to replicate other navigation signals is also desired (Galileo and GLONASS, L5, M-code and signals from Asian navigation systems).<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) from potential sources capable of demonstrating relevant experience with real-time closed-loop GPS simulation technologies. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. The government will evaluate the respondent's capabilities based on experience in the following: a) GPS simulation technology, b) CRPA anti-jam test systems, c) jamming signals simulation and d) real-time closed-loop simulation. References for simulation systems delivered are required. Based upon the responses to this RFI, an Industry Day may be announced at a later date. This RFI is not a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any information submitted is voluntary. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the AFRL Contracting Division, AFRL/RWK, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Bldg 13, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6810, ATTN: Ms. MiMi Martin, or sent electronically to mimi.martin@eglin.af.mil. Please provide electronic responses with this subject: RFI for CLOSED-LOOP GLOBAL POSTIONING SATELLITE (GPS) SIMULATION. Responses must be received no later than 3 PM CDT on 1 August 2011. For technical questions, please contact Mr. Shawn Goodrich, at 850-882-4628.<br />

<SUBJECT>REDUCING PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS AMONG NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS: SOURCES SOUGHT

<DESC><strong>REDUCING PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS AMONG NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS: SOURCES SOUGHT</strong>
<p><strong>Purpose of Notice</strong></p>
<p>Prior to engaging in a procurement activity to acquire vendors for the testing of interventions to improve the health care situation for nursing home residents (both Medicare and Medicaid recipients), the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is issuing this sources sought notice. This Sources Sought Notice is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUBZONE small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and women-owned small businesses) in accordance with FAR 7.105(b)1. The potential small businesses will need to demonstrate the ability to provide the services defined in this notice under Requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) within CMS is developing an overall initiative to address a widespread and costly problem: nursing facility residents are subject to frequent preventable inpatient hospitalizations. These hospitalizations are expensive, disruptive, disorienting, and often dangerous for frail elders and people with disabilities. CMS research on nursing facility residents eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid in 2005 found 314,000 potentially avoidable hospitalizations, accounting for $2.6 billion in Medicare expenditures.</p>
<p>Working with qualified vendors, CMS hopes to achieve the following objectives in each intervention strategy as implemented:</p>
<p>&bull; Reduce the frequency of preventable hospital admissions and readmissions<br />&bull; Improve the process of transitioning between inpatient hospitals, long term care facilities, rehabilitation facilities, and the community<br />&bull; Reduce overall health care spending without restricting access to care or choice of providers<br />The primary focus of the clinical interventions would be Medicare-Medicaid enrollees in nursing facilities, but it may also benefit residents who are not yet Medicare-Medicaid enrollees (i.e., Medicare beneficiaries not yet eligible for Medicaid but who represent similar opportunities for inpatient reductions). The interventions should focus on extended-stay residents rather than those who are likely to experience only a brief post-acute stay and then return home.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements<br /><br /></strong>The work that will be addressed under the future contract will require the vendor to be able to, at a minimum, develop and implement interventions that:</p>
<p>Demonstrate strong evidence base;<br /><br />Provide support during transitions to and from inpatient hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and nursing facilities, including facilitating timely and complete exchange of health information among providers;</p>
<p>Provide support for improved communication and coordination among hospital staff (including attending physicians), nursing facility staff, pharmacies...etc;</p>
<p>Work in cooperation with existing providers, including residents' primary care providers, nursing facility staff, and families to implement best practices and improve the overall quality of nursing facility care, focusing on quality improvement activities that most directly relate to preventable hospitalizations;</p>
<p>Partner with nursing facility staff to implement preventive services, such as care to prevent urinary tract infections, dehydration, and other common causes of preventable hospitalizations;</p>
<p>Coordinate and improve management and monitoring of prescription drugs to reduce risk of polypharmacy and adverse drug events for residents;</p>
<p>Supplement (rather than replace) existing care provided by nursing facility staff;</p>
<p>Demonstrate strong potential for replication in other communities and institutions;</p>
<p>Coordinate closely with state health reform efforts, including other CMS demonstrations and waivers; and</p>
<p>Allow for participation by nursing facility residents without any need for residents or their families to change providers or enroll in a health plan.<br /><br />Interventions may also include:<br /><br />&bull;Enhanced behavioral health assessments, treatment, and management;<br />&bull;Support for residents and nursing facility staff to facilitate a successful discharge to the community; <br />&bull;Health information technology tools to support sharing of care summaries across transitions in care and maintenance of accurate, up-to-date medication lists; <br />&bull;Person-centered care that improves communication among the health care team and improves care coordination;<br />&bull;Support for resident and family long-term planning and meeting the resident's care preferences (e.g., community living options).<br />The primary focus of the clinical interventions would be Medicare-Medicaid enrollees in nursing facilities, but it may also benefit residents who are not yet Medicare-Medicaid enrollees (i.e., Medicare beneficiaries not yet eligible for Medicaid but who represent similar opportunities for inpatient reductions). The intervention would focus on extended-stay residents rather than those who are likely to experience only a brief post-acute stay and then return home.</p>
<p>To fund these interventions, CMS would contract with entities to establish and manage the interventions. We expect these entities would hire staff who would maintain a physical presence at participating nursing facilities.</p>
<p>CMS is not planning to permit nursing facilities to act as vendors under the future contract.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>The government expects that the final contract(s) for this body of work will be for a base period of 12 months and three (3) twelve month option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the government.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statements</strong></p>
<p>In response to this sources sought notice, CMS is seeking capability statements. Capability statements are NOT proposals and do not address price/cost. The contractor community is merely asked to provide information which may demonstrate that they have expertise and capacity to meet the requirements of this work as a prime contractor, with subcontractors as they deem necessary.</p>
<p>For the purposes of responding to this notice, contractors should address the following:</p>
<p>1.Experience partnering with nursing facilities, supporting Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries during transitions between care settings (including inpatient hospitals, nursing facilities, and home and community-based settings), and working with data relevant to this initiative;</p>
<p>2. Ability to simultaneously implement and manage an intervention that would meet the requirements outlined above in at least 15 nursing facilities;</p>
<p>3. Ability to obtain support from the State Medicaid and survey &amp; certification agencies and at least 15 nursing facility partners;</p>
<p>4. Organizational resources for training, reporting, quality assurance, and back-up staffing sufficient to manage clinical activities at multiple sites simultaneously;</p>
<p>5. Ability to hire staff, train staff, produce policies and procedures, and pass a readiness review process prior to implementing the intervention (prior to receiving any payment from CMS); and</p>
<p>6.Sufficient procedures and facilities to protect proprietary and confidential data and analysis.</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center(LaRC), acting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) acquisitionagent for procurement of climate sensors, is hereby soliciting information from potentialsources on their capability to produce a Clouds and the Earths Radiant Energy System -Continuity (CERES-C) Instrument, a follow-on instrument to the CERES instruments beingflown on the Earth Observing System  (EOS) Terra and Aqua mission and CERES instrumentsplanned for flight on the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental SatelliteSystem (NPOESS) Preparatory Project (NPP) spacecraft  and the Joint Polar SatelliteSystem-1 (JPSS-1) spacecraft.  NASA seeks information from entities which havesuccessfully demonstrated the ability to design, build, test, and calibrate spaceflightinstruments capable of making accurate measurements of the solar reflected and Earthemitted energy in the spectral range from 0.5 to greater than 50 micrometers.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites forthe release of any solicitation or synopsis. BackgroundThe measurements provided by the CERES instruments are key elements in the production ofEarth Radiation Budget (ERB) Climate Data Records, records that have been produced on acontinuous basis for more than 20 years, including measurements from the Earth RadiationBudget Experiment prior to CERES.  Maintaining the continuity of these measurements andthe ERB records is part of an overarching NOAA program objective to sustain continuity ofand enhance Earth observation analysis, forecasting and climate monitoring capabilitiesfrom global polar-orbiting observations.The level of measurement accuracy necessary to assess climate change and understand theinteractions of natural and anthropogenic effects occurring on a decadal time scalerequires that instruments making these measurements overlap on orbit for sufficientperiods to achieve transfer of calibration from one instrument to the next.  The CERESinstruments currently operating on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aquamissions have provided over 10 years of accurate measurements of the solar reflected andEarth emitted energy.  The CERES FM5 Instrument, being prepared for an October 2011launch on the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP), and the CERES FM6 Instrument, currentlyin integration and planned for launch aboard JPSS-1, mid-decade, should providecontinuity of ERB measurements into the next decade. The CERES-Continuity (CERES-C)instruments are the follow-on instruments which are expected to launch on subsequent JPSSmissions and provide the continuity of ERB measurements through the third decade of the21st century. CERES-C RequirementsRequirements for the CERES-C Instrument for this informational request are decomposedinto the following three categories: 1) mission/platform interface requirements, 2)sensor radiometric measurement and measurement performance requirements, and 3)instrument radiometric calibration and calibration traceability requirements.Mission/Platform Interface RequirementsMission/platform interface requirements for the CERES-C instrument are the same as forthe current CERES Flight Model 6 (FM6) instrument planned for JPSS-1.  The nominal FM6requirements/capabilities are given in Table 1, which is attached to this notice.The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), CERES to JPSS-1 Interface Control Document (ICD)is available upon request. Requests for the ICD should be directed to James B. Miller atthe e-mail address noted below.Sensor Radiometric Measurement and Radiometric Performance RequirementsCERES-C instrument sensor radiometric measurement and radiometric performancerequirements are defined in Table 2, which is attached to this notice. Instrument Radiometric Calibration and Calibration Traceability RequirementsCalibration and calibration traceability is of utmost importance in the construction ofthe CERES-C instrument and is critical to instrument long term sensor radiometricaccuracy.  The pre-flight calibration of the CERES-C instrument(s) must be traceable tointernational standards and to the on-orbit operational CERES instruments.  Both groundand in-flight calibration will be required for the CERES-C instrument.To support calibration, the instrument swath shall permit pointing positions includingall Earth viewing angles, as well as a clear view of space at each end of the swath.  Theinstrument shall permit the viewing of onboard calibration sources for all channelsthrough the full optical path, and allow for stowing of the sensor optics to protect fromcontamination.	The field of view shall permit the Shortwave and Total channel detectorsand full optical paths to view the Sun indirectly, and moon directly for calibration. Tosupport solar and lunar viewing the instrument field of view shall be commandable over atleast 350 degrees in azimuth.Details of what needs to be addressed in this response respective to calibration andcalibration traceability are provided below (see section on Response Information.Additional RequirementsConcepts and approaches for a CERES-C instrument fundamental design must be based onflight proven hardware with comparable measurement capability and performance to thatspecified in the requirements provided in this informational request or proven relevantthrough performance measurement and life-testing of hardware in appropriate ground-basedenvironments. Responses must also consider a CERES-C design, development, test, andcalibration cycle to first flight instrument delivery 58 months after receiving authorityto proceed.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), intends to competitively award a contract entitled Social Indicators in the Coastal Alaska Arctic Communities.  The BOEMRE, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement plus fixed fee type contract for the effort described herein.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620  Environmental Consulting Services.  The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described in the subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP).  The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to include a 15-month base period and an 18-month option period, totaling 33 months if the option is exercised .
BACKGROUND:The Bureau of Ocean Energy Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) is the federal administrative agency created both to conduct OCS lease sales and to monitor and mitigate adverse impacts that might be associated with offshore resource development. The BOEMRE environmental studies program provides information needed to predict, assess, and manage impacts from offshore energy and marine mineral exploration, development, and production activities on human, marine, and coastal environments.
PURPOSE:The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) is seeking contractor support to provide baseline data measuring the sense of well-being of residents in select Arctic coastal communities.  This study will establish a set of robust, valid, and reliable social indicators through their formulation nested within sets of key social domains. They are needed to predict, monitor, and mitigate effects on local populations for NEPA evaluations of oil and gas exploration and development in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and assessing changing conditions in the Arctic Strategic Action Plan for the National Oceans Policy.  Social Indicators in Coastal Alaska: Arctic Communities will develop an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved survey instrument and evaluate current conditions and trends in economic prosperity, the status of health and safety, and changes in the status of indigenous rights and cultural well-being before and after oil and gas exploration and development through the identification of quantitative measures of effects on existing community infrastructure, public services, and human well-being. The study will result in an OMB approved survey instrument for Alaskan coastal communities, a technical report that includes quantification of the social indicators, results of analysis of all information collected; a technical summary of the research, and a draft journal article for potential publication in a peer-reviewed journal. 
SCOPE OF WORKThis project will result in two main final deliverables: the survey instrument with a responsive database and a final comprehensive report. The general scope of work and program scheduling is as follows:
Base Year:1.	Community Engagement:  Establish formal contact with potential host communities and create a protocol to facilitate community participation and meaningful collaboration in the performance of this research;2.	Literature Search: Conduct a literature search on previous northern social indicator studies, such as Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) (http://portal.sdwg.org/content.php?doc=81) or construction of social indicators, such as Arctic Social Indicators, a Follow-up to the Arctic Human Development Report (http://www.svs.is/ASI/Report%20Chapters/Report%20Chapters.htm);3.	Develop Social Indicators: Utilize the ASI proposed social indicators or develop and justify a series of relevant social indicators and submit to the BOEMRE prior to a meeting for the purpose of discussion preliminary to acceptance;4.	Survey: Prepare a strategic survey instrument, pre-test it, and obtain the necessary approvals for use from relevant BOEMRE review offices for submission to the Office of Management and Budget.
Option 1:1.	Upon notification that the option will be exercised, and approval from OMB, prepare to administer the survey;2.	Conduct the survey in the noted communities;3.	Data Analysis: Organize data into a workable database and analyze with appropriate multivariate statistical techniques; conduct a comprehensive analysis of the results of all prior tasks and prepare a draft report of the study findings;4.	Report Findings: Circulate the draft report to the BOEMRE and host community leaders to facilitate parallel reviews by peer scientists and interested stakeholders; respond to review comments and prepare a final report, incorporating reviewer edits and comments where appropriate; report the study results to each participating community through public meetings or workshops.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) basic authority to operate as a permanent clearinghouse of scientific and technical information is codified in Chapter 23 of Title 15 of the United States Code (15 U.S.C. 1151-1157). This chapter also established NTIS' authority to charge fees for its products and services and to recover all costs through such fees "to the extent feasible."</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The authority was restated in the National Technical Information Act of 1988, codified as 15 U.S.C. 3704b. This Act gave NTIS the authority to enter into joint ventures and declared the Clearinghouse to be a permanent Federal function that could not be eliminated or privatized without Congressional approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">National Technical Information Act of 1988 was amended by the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-245) which:</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><span>&bull;(1)<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">required all costs associated with bibliographic control to be covered by fees;</span></p>

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Another statute having a profound impact on NTIS is the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Act for FY 1993 (Public Law 102-395) which established NTIS Revolving Fund and gave it authority to use that Fund without further approval by Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">In addition, Section 1526 of Title 15 of the United States Code authorizes NTIS to accept payments in advance for services to be provided to other Federal Government agencies. </span></p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">II. GENERAL SCOPE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The NTIS, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is seeking information that can provide and direct an overarching plan for the integration of all existing agency communication efforts to include new strategies on improving customer outreach and interaction. New strategies would include the utilization of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and Information Architecture (IA) which are guided by the Web Policies and Best Practices of the Department of Commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">NTIS currently markets products and services using a variety of outreach efforts including the NTIS website, newsletters, direct mail/email marketing, webinars, trade shows, symposiums, and social media. The proposed plan would assist with the integration of these efforts and would provide cost-effective and consistent solutions on how to develop and promote the mission of NTIS through effective brand messaging. This strategy is challenging because the NTIS mission is unique: to promote the economic growth and opportunity by serving as the Federal Government's central means of making scientific and technical information perpetually and widely available, and is required by law to operate on a self-sustaining basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">NTIS has developed relationships with its core customer constituencies and uniquely formed public/private partnerships, but seeks to strengthen and broaden the scope of its customer base and support through the utilization of an all-encompassing communication program. The core customer constituencies include the library, business, academic, federal, and general public communities. </span></p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION(NON-COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT)
(Technical/Requirements Personnel shall answer each of the following)
1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition." 
The EAA AirVenture is the largest air show in the world. During the 7 days of the event over 700,000 people will attend the convention. Rooms are reserved years in advance and there are no rooms available in Oshkosh. The National Park Service is a member of the International Federal Partnership which has been staying as a group in Appleton, which is about 20 miles from Oshkosh, for the past Airshows. 
2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 
The PR submitted is for lodging for NPS staff and volunteers while they work at the EAA AirVenture outreach event in the Oshkosh, WI.  AirVenture is the largest air show in the world. Rooms are reserved years in advance and finding available hotel rooms in Oshkosh or nearby Appleton, Fond Du Lac, or Neenah, WI is extremely difficult.  Additionally, the cost of hotel rooms in the area usually double, triple, or quadruple their regular fees - putting hotel costs well above the standard per diem rate for this area. 
3.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs. 

The Holiday Inn in Appleton, Wisconsin has rooms available for the nights needed to house the NPS staff that will be working the EAA AIRVENTURE Convention/outreach effort. This hotel is providing rooms to all participating agencies in the Federal International Partnership group of which the NPS is a member. We need to stay at this hotel because the Partnership has shared support services such as rides to the convention, equipment sharing, access to meeting rooms for the group and appropriate security for officers.

4.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 
FAR 6.302-1
5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. 
The Holiday Inn in Appleton, Wisconsin has rooms available for the nights needed to house the NPS staff that will be working the EAA AirVenture Convention/outreach effort. This hotel is providing rooms to all participating agencies in the Federal International Partnership group of which the NPS is a member. We need to stay at this hotel because the Partnership has shared support services such as rides to the convention, equipment sharing, access to meeting rooms for the group and appropriate security for officers.
6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 
A formal market search was conducted and either we found that there are no hotels rooms available in Oshkosh, WI and the surrounding area during the time needed or that the hotels available are charging, on an average daily rate, more than what Holiday Inn in Appleton is offering to provide us rooms for and not all room requests could possibly be granted.  
7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 
Due to the lack of local availability of rooms, it is in the best interest of the NPS to stay with the other members of the International Federal Partnership in Appleton, WI at the Holiday Inn where they have made rooms available to us at a reasonable rate 
8.  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 
Market research was conducted on the availability of hotel rooms in the area of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the city hosting the EAA AirVenture 2011 Convention.

9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.
There are no follow-on acquisitions.
10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. 
None.
11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 
We continue to look for better values in hotel rooms as additional hotels are constructed in the Oshkosh, Appleton and surrounding area. However the demand for rooms is so great that as these locations come on line they are almost immediately booked for the week of the EAA AirVenture event.  As the event continues to grow each year, so does the demand for hotel rooms.



Guidance for completing a Justification for Non-Competitive Procurement not exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold ($100,000), per FAR 6.3
Per COTI-1443.6 - 01, 8/24/04:  The contracting officer must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  The contracting officer may solicit from one source if they determine that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  The requesting office must prepare a written justification describing the reasons for the sole source acquisition and provide to the contracting officer along with the completed purchase request.  The contracting officer must concur in writing with the justification.  If the requirement exceeds $25,000, the contracting officer (Deb Imhoff) at a level above the contracting officer (Linda Gordon) must also concur in writing with the justification.  If the requirement exceeds $25,000, the contracting officer must post a synopsis as required by FAR 5.2 prior to award and consider any responses received. 
Per FAR 6.3, only the following is authorized for other than full and open competition (consult the FAR for a full explanation of each category):6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.6.302-2  Unusual and compelling urgency6.302-3  Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services.6.302-4  International agreement6.302-5  Authorized or required by statute6.302-6  National security6.302-7  Public interest
As per FAR 6.303-2:Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information: 1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition." 2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 3.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). 4.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. 6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 8.  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. 11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 12.  Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.

<SUBJECT>Utility Energy Savings Contract (UESC) at MCB Quantico
<SOLNBR>0DUMMY2145965
<ARCHDATE>07312011
<CONTACT>
<DESC>THE 2007 NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE APPLICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT: 221 UTILITIES

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Washington intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2913 which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utilities) in order to address the requirements and circumstances of the installation. This contract is referred to as a  (UESC).
 For purposes of qualifying under this notice, an entity must meet the definition of a Utility before an agreement can be initiated. 

The proposed procurement is to provide Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs)for data centers at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia. The primary goals of the project are to provide a high efficiency data center that reduces energy use and reduces energy costs. These improvements will be accomplished by evaluating existing site conditions and data center upgrade plans and then proposing ECMs. 

The Government plans to increase the hosting capacity of its primary data center by adding power, Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS), generator, and Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units in a 4,900 SF Data Center to support additional Information Technology (IT) equipment.
   To optimize the efficiency of the data center facility, this project also will analyze and propose upgrades to the following building equipment and systems: building envelope, lighting, HVAC systems, miscellaneous loads, energy management controls, water infrastructure, electrical infrastructure (transformers, power quality controllers), meters/sub-meters, and onsite generation/distributed energy resources (DERS). 

These ECMs shall be provided, via a no-cost preliminary energy audit.  The preliminary audit will require on-site building investigation and evaluation to determine if any significant energy conservation opportunities exist and whether further detailed energy analysis is warranted.
 The Government may elect to proceed with further phases under the UESC which include, but are not limited to, the feasibility study phase, the engineering and design phase, and the implementation phase. 

The process requires that the responsible Utility must have the ability to provide or obtain financing on terms at least as good as those available to customers in a comparable service class, or with a comparable risk profile. Therefore, contractor will not receive compensation until completion of the implementation project, and payments will be based on a long-term amortization schedule. 

Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration.
 The submission must include the NAICS code and Cage Code. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Responses to this posting must be submitted to peter.kho@navy.mil in PDF format no later than July 22, 2011. 

All narratives shall be no longer than twenty (20) pages in length. Any pages after page twenty will not be evaluated.

The period of performance for this work assignment will be from January 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011. <br />(2) Work Assignment 0-105 is funded to $269,530. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from January 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011. <br />(3) Work Assignment 0-106 is funded to $113,080.37. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from April 28, 2011 through November 30, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The objective of Work Assignment 0-100 is for the contractor to provide support to EPA's Office of Water in management and oversight of ARRA funds provided to the CWSRF and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) programs. Management and oversight of the CWSRF and DWSRF ARRA funds will include assisting EPA Headquarters and EPA Regional Offices in the review and auditing of State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs of individual states to ensure proper use of ARRA funds and compliance with ARRA requirements.<br />The objective of Work Assignment 0-105 is for the contractor to provide services for the management of the CWSRF Benefits Reporting (CBR) Database for tracking ARRA funds, to include, data definition updates and providing technical assistance to States and EPA Regions. The contractor shall provide technical assistance to facilitate reporting transparency, and develop, update, and expand a portfolio of reports on the environmental and economic impact of CWSRF loans made with ARRA funds. <br />The objective of Work Assignment 0-106 is for the contractor to provide data up-dating, data processing, report generation, development of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) Financial Statement Module. The contractor shall also provide training services in support of the Drinking Water National Information Management System (DWNIMS). The training will support EPA's ability to implement and promote the participation of DWSRF programs in inputting data for the generation of national statistics and reports and better manage the DWSRF program.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>Please provide a BRAND NAME OR EQUAL quote. If an or equal quote is submitted, the proposal will be sent to the technical advisor for compatibility verification. ANY OFFEROR PROVIDING AN OR EQUAL PRODUCT SHOULD DESCRIBE THOROUGHLY HOW THEIR PRODUCT MEETS ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS LISTED BELOW. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL MAKE THAT OFFEROR NON-RESPONSIVE AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.</p>
<p>Below is a description of the requirement and license necessary.</p>
<p>USSOCOM currently utilizes Splunk with 120 GB licensing installed and is considering increasing the license amount by 70 GB. This requirement is for the upgrade of those licenses. To satisfy this requirement the solution must be an upgrade to the Splunk licensing using Splunk licensing or be considered an "or equal" product to Splunk licensing and are furnishing a new proposed solution. If proposing a new solution, the proposal must include the following at a minimum: cost of the licensing, servers, hardware, software, implementation, installation, training and travel necessary to get your solution up and running immediately following award of this requirement on 1 October 2011.</p>
<p>In response to CJCSI 6510.01D, Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (CND), and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) support requirements for the Warfighter, USSOCOM has employed Splunk with 120 GB licensing to provide the capability of centrally viewing network security status across the entire USSOCOM enterprise infrastructure in real time. USSCOCOM needs additional licensing (70 GB) to satisfy an increased utilization of the Splunk tool to search, report, monitor, and analyze streaming and historical data from a multitude of devices across the enterprise, which includes five physical sites and two separate networks at each site. The increased licensing will be utilized to assist the Splunk tool in conducting centralized security operations viewing of security logs, security events and produce a consolidated listing (using a common taxonomy to describe events) of correlated security events from multiple devices (100 Microsoft Servers, 20 Unix Servers, 8 Cisco Firewalls, 2 Sidewinder Firewalls, 5 Proxy Servers, 3 McAfee ePO servers (HBSS console), 60 Cisco Routers, 40 Switches, 6 Websense filters, 2 Bluecoat web filters, 20 Sourcefire IDSs) worldwide in order to protect the enterprise from security incidents, malicious intrusion and cyber attacks.</p>
<p>The additional licensing solution must seamlessly integrate with existing Splunk enterprise perpetual licensing to create an aggregate license of 190 GB that can be divided as desired per site. It will support the continued tool capabilities to include but not limited to: ability to search billions of events in seconds on a single commodity server (government provided Dell 815, Dual CPU, 12 core, 2.3 GHz, 6 - 300 GB hard drives with Microsoft Server 2008 R2); investigating security incidents in minutes; troubleshooting or diagnosing malfunctioning applications; and allowing continuous monitoring in efforts of avoiding service degradation or outages. It must also support automatic load balancing to optimize workloads and response times and must enable redundancy and built-in failover support. Also, it must allow the ability to store data to a SAN or other storage device to meet long term storage needs (90 days local storage, 1 year external storage (SAN/NAS)).</p>
<p>The increased licensing shall support Splunk indexes of any kind of IT data (e.g.; Syslog, WMI, SNMP trap) from any source in real time. The solution should support Splunk indexing of all IT data without the need for any specific parsers or adapters to purchase, write, or maintain. The licensing must support a distributed architecture to allow the search of multiple deployments within the USSOCOM Enterprise.</p>
<p>USSOCOM's network monitoring effectiveness will be diminished without this increase in licensing. Furthermore, a lack of sufficient licensing precludes the appropriate visibility of potential risks and limits the ability to quickly identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, which could lead to unauthorized personnel or hacker access, denial of services and/or compromised data. This type of activity will pose additional risks to operational SOF missions worldwide.</p>
<p>Proposed solution for USSOCOM must:</p>
<p>&bull; Seamlessly integrate with existing Splunk perpetual licensing if proposing an upgrade the current Splunk licenses.<br />&bull; Allow division of aggregate licensing across all five sites for two separate networks at each site.<br />&bull; Be interoperable with USSOCOM's current enterprise monitoring tool: Splunk if proposing an upgrade the current Splunk licenses.<br />&bull; Support scalability for potential future growth.<br />&bull; Run on a Microsoft Windows platform (Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2).<br />&bull; Support normal operations and capabilities of the Splunk tool, to include but not limited to: centralized security logging and monitoring of security events; correlation of security events from multiple devices; audit log integration from applications, operating systems and network logs; rapid and thorough identification of computer incidents occurring on any nodes, regardless of physical or network location; analysis of multiple files/folders across an array of servers and support the ability to review both unique closed networks and standalone systems.<br />&bull; Include maintenance support to remediate and/or fix any deficiency or eliminate minor problems.<br />&bull; Provide on-call support to assist in recovery and management of data, files and services.<br />&bull; Provide technical support to assigned personnel to ensure the continued operations with no lapse in current capability.<br />&bull; Meet the standards of DODI 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation.<br />&bull; Be delivered not later than 1 October 2011.</p>
<p>Proposed solution for USSOCOM must not:<br />&bull; Require additional hardware and/or software if proposing an upgrade the current Splunk licenses. <br />&bull; Preclude government from meeting required vulnerability management standards.<br />&bull; Inhibit or impede current Splunk functionality if proposing an upgrade the current Splunk licenses.<br />&bull; Restrict aggregate license division as required by the government.<br />&bull; Prevent USSOCOM from electing to use licensing on closed networks or standalone systems.<br />&bull; Require specific parsers or adapters to purchase, write, or maintain.<br />&bull; Limit the ability to store data to a SAN or other storage device for long term storage needs.<br />&bull; Restrict the aggregate number of devices that can be monitored.</p>

<p>2. Technical Approach -Sub-factors are of equal importance:</p>
<p>a. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) -- The WBS expands on the Statement of Work (SOW) to clearly delineate and define the steps necessary to achieve the requirements of the SOW in a logical, concrete sequence with sufficient details to demonstrate that the offeror both understands the SOW requirements, and is capable of successfully implementing them.</p>
<p>b. Implementation Plan -- The project implementation plan must be clear and well-defined to frame project goals and present the project schedule and timelines which outlines specific tasks necessary in delivering the services. The implementation plan must describe the methodologies used to meet the installation, maintenance and repair, and training requirements and schedules.</p>
<p>c. Schedule - The project implementation plan must clearly outline a schedule that meets the requirements in Section 4.6.</p>
<p>3. Experience - Sub factors are of equal importance:</p>
<p>a. Installation - Offeror must demonstrate capability for installations at or near the U.S.-Mexican border, areas having limited federal logistics and/or support, upon contract award. The offeror should list proposed installation facilities and their proximity to the U.S. - Mexico border as well a mobile installation plan.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Management Approach -Sub-factors are of equal importance:</p>
<p>a. Management Plan -- Management plan identifies subcontractors, teaming members, key personnel, other staff, and all other necessary resources for implementation of the SOW and how they will be used to carry out the SOW. Delineate all responsibilities and management responsibilities, management process and coordination necessary to insure successful completion of the SOW. Submit a two page resume for Project Manager as an attachment.</p>
<p>b. Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan -- Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan is well defined and provides effective tracking for all phases of implementation of the SOW.</p>
<p>(Volume III) Page Limit of 15 pages.</p>
<p>5. Past Performance -Past Performance will be determined to be "Relevant" or "Non Relevant".</p>
<p>a. Offeror provides documentation of 3 projects within the last 5 years that are similar in size, scope, and contractor responsibility to the work of the SOW. At a minimum, the Offeror provides:</p>
<p>b. Contract or Agreement Number, Project Name (if applicable) and Current name of the customer<br />c. Point of contact with email address and telephone number<br />d.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Volume IV) No Page Limitations.</p>
<p>6. Price -Attachment 3 is a suggested format. A firm fixed price award is anticipated. Prices shall include clearly stated costs and cost elements that are anticipated based on the attached Statement of Work (SOW). Offerors shall provide prices for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). Price is less important than all the technical factors above combined and will not be adjectively rated. Pricing will be evaluated to determine cost reasonableness and cost realism of the offer. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents Best Value to the Government, technical and non-technical factors considered. As technical proposals become more equivalent, price will become significantly more important. Cost/price will be evaluated separately from past performance and other non-cost/price factors, and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>Offerors shall adhere to page limitation stipulated for each factor. Pages in excess of the stated limitations will not be forwarded to the evaluation team for review and could possibly impact the overall ratings received. Cover pages, indexes and table of contents will not count against the page limitation. Resumes are also not included in the total page count but shall not exceed 2 pages per individual. Pages shall be 8.5 by 11 inch with a Times New Romans font size of 12. Foldout pages of 11 by 17 shall only be used for tables and figures and will count as one page. Double sided pages will count as 2 pages. There is no page limitation for the Price Factor. However, the price proposal shall only include the information as per the instructions contained herein. Offerors can include up to 3 pages of introductory information on the Company. However, offerors are cautioned not to include information relevant to the factors within these pages, as it may not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Proposals shall include (1) your Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) information; and (2) a statement whether your company is registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Lastly, proposals shall set forth any exceptions/assumptions taken with regard to the SOW, or any other aspect of the solicitation or any other information that you find necessary and pertinent to the terms and conditions of your proposal.</p>
<p><br />(xviii) It is the policy of the FMCSA to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. Potential offerors who believe that a FMCSA solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer for this procurement is Ms. Diane Bethea, Diane.Bethea@dot.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NEED2000-11-03215 is being issued as a Request for Quotation. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 611310 and business size of $7.0M. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NEDSIS), Office of Research and Applications (E/RA), has a project entitled Satellite Reprocessing in Support of NOAA CDR and Reanalysis Program. NOAA/NESDIS is reprocessing and recalibrating radiance data from the NOAA and other polar-orbiting satellite series. The instruments being investigated include MSU/AMSU/ATMS, SSU, and GPSRO, etc. In this project, we will recalibrate and reprocess the 31 years of AMSU/ATMS/SSU radiance sensor data records (SDR) using simultaneous nadir overpass. We will correct the CO2 leaking problems in the SSU cell pressure for consistent reanalysis data assimilation. We will develop intercalibration schemes to generate consistent long-term time series from AMSU/ATMS/SSU and GPSRO. We will collaborate with NCEP and ECMWF to compare reanalysis bias corrections with NESDIS/STAR satellite calibration effort. In summary, this project supports the NOAA Scientific Data Stewardship (SDS) program and NOAA/NCEP reanalysis activities. Detailed Tasks: 1) Generate consistent SSU radiance SDRs and TCDRs. Continue working on bias corrections to reduce inter-satellite biases. Limb-corrections, instrument CO2 leaking corrections, atmospheric CO2 concentration corrections, diurnal sampling corrections, SNO calibration, and statistical merging have already been completed in previous project years. Version 1.0 of SSU FCDR and TCDR has been released in the second project year. In this project year, tasks will be focusing on merging of the SSU and AMSU channels. ATBD for SSU FCDR and TCDR are expected to be completed in this project year; and 2) Validation against GPSRO data. The recalibrated AMSU/SSU stratospheric channels will be compared to the GPSRO observations for an error and stability assessment. Period of Performance: Date of Award through June 30, 2012.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NEED3000-11-03241 is being issued as a Request for Quotation. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541712 and business size of 500. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NEDSIS), Office of Research and Applications (E/RA), has a project entitled "Theory to explain the penetration of Rossby waves through the Kuroshio into the South China Sea at the Luzon Strait". Preliminary observations based on satellite altimetry and observations reported in the literature show that baroclinic Rossby long waves are able to penetrate the Luzon Strait into the South China Sea despite the fact that they have to pass through the Kuroshio (a strong western boundary current in the North Pacific), where the prevailing belief is that the Rossby waves should be absorbed by the Kuroshio rather than being able to penetrate through the Kuroshio. Now the tasks are to, first, refine the observations to get the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of the phenomenon and, second, build on an existing theory of how internal waves penetrate through the Kuroshio to get a theory of how Rossby waves penetrate through the Kuroshio. Task List: 1) Submit a paper for publication in ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA to explain the phenomenon with a theoretical model; 2) Follow through on the review process for the paper; and 3) Refine observations and theory. Deliverables: 1) Document the observations and report it in literature; 2) Document the theory and report it in literature; and 3) The project will result in a scientific report that will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Period of Performance: Date of Award through June 30, 2012. The resulting purchase order shall awarded on a firm fixed price. The award shall be made on a best value basis.

A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  
(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.

(i) TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PROPOSED ITEM
(ii) PAST PERFORMANCE
(iii) PRICE

Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.
  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) and delineated in SOW will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, combined with Factor (i), is of equal importance with Factor (iii), PRICE. 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

(b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items or services proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items or services offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.
 

(c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(d)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ .

<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Objectives.</span><span style="COLOR: black"> The </span>Bureau of Labor Statistics has an ongoing need for detailed household expenditure data with which to analyze, evaluate and improve the Consumer Price Index (CPI).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the BLS is seeking a contractor that collects household expenditure data on the items households buy and the retail stores they frequent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The data provided by the survey will be compared by BLS staff with CPI data in order to evaluate the completeness and the accuracy of the expenditure estimates used in the CPI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the private contractor data will be used by BLS to evaluate population specific consumer price indexes for a variety of alternative demographic based populations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to fully achieve these objectives item data provided must be at a level of detail equivalent to Universal Product Codes, stores must be identified by name or code, and household records must include a variety of demographic characteristics such as age, family size, and income.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The expenditure data must be based on data collected from households through the use of electronic scanning equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This request covers a 12-month calendar year beginning in 2010 or later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Earlier years of data are also highly desirable and a purchase option for these should be included in any response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The data shall be in an electronically accessible form such as a PC database.</p>

<p><br />Subject: Request for Proposals No. SOL-492-11-000010 - <br />Strengthening the Capacity of Civil Society Organizations in the Philippines</p>
<p>To All Prospective Offerors:</p>
<p>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to the Philippines, is seeking proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing the services described in the attached solicitation.</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted through full and open competition, for which the procedures for "contracting by negotiation, trade-off process" method of procurement, as described in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), will apply. Offerors who submit proposals in response to this RFP may be required to give an oral presentation.</p>
<p>Proposals will be accepted from Philippine and Non-Philippines non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private, for-profit and non-profit organizations, including universities, research organizations, professional associations, and relevant special interest associations. Faith-based and community organizations are also eligible for award. In support of USAID's interest in expanding the number and sustainability of development partners, USAID encourages proposals from potential new partners.</p>
<p>USAID plans to award a cost-plus-fixed-fee completion type contract. The maximum amount of the contract (costs and fee) is $1.5 million, covering an estimated period of performance of three years. However, offerors should not necessarily strive to equal this amount. Cost-effective approaches to achieving the results are encouraged, and lower-cost offers will be rewarded under Section M of this solicitation. Offerors must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost proposals will be evaluated as part of the best value procedure in determining the contract award.</p>
<p>USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns in this activity as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor, in accordance with FAR Part 19.</p>
<p>Receipt of this solicitation through the internet must be confirmed by written notification to Procurement Secretary Irene Narag at email address aidmnlorp@usaid.gov. It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation document to ensure that it has been received in its entirety, including subsequent solicitation amendments, if any. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.</p>
<p>Issuance of this solicitation and the submittal of a proposal do not constitute a commitment on the part of the U.S. Government nor USAID to make an award, neither does it constitute an obligation for any costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. Award will be subject to funds availability following the proper completion of required USAID internal processes.</p>
<p>Further, the U.S. Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received. To this end, this RFP is being issued and consists of this cover letter and the text of the attached request for proposals (RFP). All offerors are cautioned to carefully review this cover letter and the contents of the RFP.</p>
<p>The details associated with the submission requirements for offerors' proposals are outlined in Section L of this solicitation. Proposals must be signed by an official who is authorized to bind the organization and are to be submitted to USAID no later than the closing date stated above. Late proposals will be handled in accordance with FAR 15.208. Facsimile submissions are not authorized and will not be accepted as valid.</p>
<p>The preferred method of proposal submission will be electronic. See Section L. of the solicitation for instructions.</p>
<p>Offerors are instructed to pay careful attention to Section K - Representations, Certifications and Acknowledgements of the accompanying Request for Proposals. Offerors are now expected to comply with FAR clause 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, and complete the annual representations and certifications electronically via the Online Representations and Certifications Application website at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>An interested vendors list is not included in this solicitation. Offerors can register and use the interested vendors list found at the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO.gov) webpage created for this solicitation so that interested firms and individuals can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities arising from this solicitation.</p>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to submit any comments or questions concerning this RFP by no later than July 15, 2011. These should be directed by email to Ms. Ma. Belinda de la Torre, Senior Acquisition &amp; Assistance Specialist at email address mdela@usaid.gov with copy to Irene Narag at aidmnlorp@usaid.gov.</p>
<p>The required closing date and time for receipt of proposals is USAID/Philippines 11 p.m. Manila local time on August 7, 2011. Point of required receipt is USAID/Philippines, Manila, Republic of the Philippines and not USAID offices in Washington, D.C. or any other location. Offerors should take account of the expected delivery time required by the proposal transmission and are responsible to ensure that proposals are received at USAID by the due date and time specified above.</p>
<p>Oral explanations or instructions given before the award of the contract will not be binding. Furthermore, the U.S. Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the U.S. Government. Award of a contract under this RFP is subject to availability of funds and other internal USAID approvals.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in working with USAID/Philippines.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<a href="mailto:zbuss@usgs.gov">zbuss@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Southwest Biological Science Center, has a requirement for Eleven (11) Mountain Lions to be captured, processed, and released on the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) AND Four (4) Mountain Lions to be recaptured, processed, and released on the Arizona Strip.
The SBSC has undertaken a long-term study of mountain lion ecology and demography on the southern Colorado Plateau and nearby regions.  The motivations for this study are (A) concerns about human safety; (B) concerns about impacts of lion predation on prey populations; and (C) concerns about impacts of human facilities and human harvest on mountain lion populations.  Objectives of this regional project include: (a) explain habitat use by lions specific to different behaviors; (b) develop robust models of habitat selection applicable to all of the southern Colorado Plateau and nearby regions; (c) explain predatory behaviors of lions; and (d) explain spatial and temporal variation in lion vital rates.
Lions are captured and fitted with collars which collect 6 highly accurate GPS locations per day, transmitted daily by Argos satellites to provide near real-time data collection.  Locations indicating a kill are visited to document lion behaviors.
Lions have been studied in the Flagstaff uplands, the south rim of Grand Canyon National Park (NP), Zion NP, Capitol Reef NP, and the Arizona Strip.  The Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) is a critical additional study area for two reasons: (1) it encompasses the hot and dry extreme of mountain lion habitat, which is key to documenting the full range of variation in lion behaviors; and (2) it is part of a unique 8 million acre complex that is largely unaffected by sport hunting of both lions and mule deer, which are the primary lion prey.  Nevada Department of Wildlife and US Department of Energy officials are interested in the ecology of lions on the NNSS because of concerns about effects of (i) lions on desert bighorn sheep populations (NDOW), (ii) lions on human safety (DOE), and (iii) sport hunting on lion populations (NDOW). The Arizona Strip is likewise a critical new study area because it is a key connection between Zion NP and the south rim of Grand Canyon, encompasses a range of biophysical conditions not covered in other study areas, and is the locus of several important management issues and proposed management actions related to lions.  Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) managers are concerned about impacts of lion predation on local bighorn sheep and pronghorn populations.  In response, they plan to kill lions.  They are also concerned about impacts of disease on bighorn sheep and plan to build water developments to disperse sheep, but with the possibility of attracting sheep to good lion habitat.  This work will provide information important to informing our broader regional lion study as well as addressing local management issues related to lions.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is G11PS00654 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in affect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-53, effective 05 July 2011. 
This requirement is subject to the information in the attached Instructions, Statement of Work, and Clauses. As well, see solicitation RFQ Standard Form 18 with list of the Contract Line Items. The tentative period of performance is August 2011 to January 2013.   The Government anticipates award of a commercial, Firm-Fixed Price type contract.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-931), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division, 1900 Half Street SW, JR11-0203, Washington, DC 20593-0001.<br />Telephone : (202) 372-3692; fax (202) 475-3904</p>

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street, SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />Telephone (202) 372-3692<br />FAX: (202)475-3904</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-48***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is&nbsp;813920 &nbsp;with a small business size standard of $14.0 Million. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation***</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Under Title XIII, Section 1305 of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has "primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of Smart Grid (SG) devices and systems..." This contract represents a portion of that effort.</p>
<p>NIST implemented a three-phase approach to fulfill its responsibility under EISA: <br />Phase 1: To recognize a set of initial existing consensus standards and develop a roadmap to fill gaps; Phase 2: To establish a standards panel, the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP)to provide ongoing recommendations for new/revised standards; and Phase 3: To establish a conformity framework that includes testing and certification.</p>
<p>The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel engages all relevant SG stakeholders to ensure an objective, open, and consensus-driven process and credible results. The process must address SG stakeholder-specific issues as well as crosscutting issues such as cyber-security and communications. The SGIP must seek balanced representation from all relevant SG stakeholders.</p>
<p>This acquisition is to obtain Contractor support to maintain Phases 2 and 3. Phase 1 was implemented under Contract No. SB134109CN0031 that was awarded on April 30, 2009 and completed on August 15, 2009. Phases 2 and 3 were implemented under Contract No. SB134109CN0099. This contract is expected to be completed on August 19, 2011. This new acquisition will continue the effort begun under Contract No. SB134109CN0099.</p>
<p>For this acquisition, which acquires support for Phases 2 and 3, the Contractor must support NIST in fulfilling its responsibility to coordinate the development and harmonization of standards to enable widespread deployment of an interoperable and secure SG.</p>
<p>The contract shall consist of a six-month base period and three six-month option periods.</p>

<DESC>This is an amendment to Request for Quote VA-241-11-RQ-0947 dated 6/29/2011.  The hour and date for receipt of offers is extended to 7/14/2011 @ 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.
1.	This amendment is issued to respond to questions received regarding the request for quotation as follows:
Question:
 Am I correct in assuming typographical errors in the base period and option periods estimated total hours? 
The description states 120 days, working Monday through Friday based on an eight hour day.  That would be 960 hours rather than 540.  I believe 540 hours would be the average work hours in a quarter.  Also, in the two option periods of 60 days each, there would be 480 work hours rather than 270.  If I am correct should I simply make the correction in the document and submit it with my proposal?
Answer:
There are no typographical errors.  The initial period of performance is for 120 WORK days.  The estimated hours for the initial 120 days is 540 hours.  There is no requirement to work eight hours per day, five days per week consecutively for the 120 WORK days.
Question:
Also, in the line items for overtime rates, lines 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16, and 18, should I be indicating the desired overtime rate at a cost per hour in the first blank space, and then a total based on that rate times the estimated total hours for the period?  I can't imagine much need for overtime hours for these positions, but I assume you need to have the high and low range for the given periods to determine the total obligation.  Please let me know if I am correct.
Answer:
Please see revised price/cost schedule below.  Overtime rates are requested as hourly rates only.
2.	 This amendment is issued to correct the Price/Cost Schedule as follows:





PRICE/COST SCHEDULE

<DESC>To Whom It May Concern:
<p>Our recent Sources Sought Notice for Multi-Disciplined Open-End Architect-Engineer Service Contracts for Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, 914 Airlift Wing, Niagara Falls, NY (RVKQ10MAY11) was a success. We would like to thank you for your interest and response.</p>
<p>A change in procedures resulted in the Sources Sought Notice being advertised with a request for SF330 packages. Generally, the SF330 is requested during the synopsis and solicitation phase of a new contract process. The intention of the Sources Sought Notice was to give an indication of how many small business vendors would be interested in submitting a SF330 when a synopsis and solicitation was advertised.</p>
<p>In proceeding with the contract award process for this requirement, Niagara Falls ARS will be issuing a properly executed synopsis and solicitation via FedBizOps (www.fbo.gov) within the next 60 days. This will give interested parties the opportunity to receive and review detailed criteria descriptions, including possible disciplines needed, and the criteria's accompanying scoring breakdown. Subsequently, interested parties may modify their SF330 packages and resubmit them to include their best answer to our future Architect and Engineering requirements.</p>
<p>Previously received SF330 packages will be retained by the Government as part of the Sources Sought phase of this process, but can be used in the synopsis and solicitation phase if we are instructed to that effect in writing.</p>
<p>If there are any questions, please contact Bernita Kitchens at bernita.kitchens@us.af.mil.</p>

<p>This acquisition will be issued on an unrestricted basis.</p>
<p>This acquisition will contain three separate and distinct portions that will result in three separate awards. For the purposes of efficiency, these portions are being combined in one solicitation rather than issuing separate solicitations for each portion.</p>
<p>The quantities for Portion #1 are as follows: minimum 75,000, annual estimated quantity 300,000, and&nbsp;maximum quantity 375,000.</p>

<p>A single contract will be awarded for each portion based on the evaluation criteria stated in the solicitation. However, no offeror will receive an award for more than one portion. The award for Portion #1 will be made before the award for Portion #2 and award for Portion #2 will be made before the award for Portion #3. To ensure that multiple sources are available, and to ensure the continuous availability of reliable sources of supply, the offeror who is selected as the best value for Portion #1 will be eliminated from competition on Portion #2 and Portion #3, and the offeror who is selected as the best value for Portion #2 will be eliminated from competition on Portion #3 based on the authority in FAR 6.202(a)(4). Orders will be issued under each separate contract in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract and without notice to, or consideration of, any other contractor, or consideration of the terms and conditions of any other contract.</p>
<p>Please note that the above scenario details the Government's intent however, we reserve the right to make awards out of sequence if deemed necessary.<br />Businesses are invited to offer on any or all portions in which they meet the requirements. <br /><br />The proposed acquisition will be awarded using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.&nbsp; Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards of non-cost factors.&nbsp; For this acquisition, the only non-cost factor is the passing ballistic test reports.&nbsp; Availability of solicitations, FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.</p>

<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below services upon receipt of order.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize yourself with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span>Since its inception, the Laboratory of Structural Biology Research (LSBR) has specialized in detailed structural analysis of macromolecules, macromolecular complexes, and subcellular structures by computer-enhanced electron microscopy. The goal of these studies is to elucidate structure-function relationships at the molecular level with particular emphasis on (but not restricted to) systems that bear directly on the mission of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). This program was initiated in 1978 with the appointment of a tenure-track investigator, and progressed to become a Section in 1984- and further to Laboratory status in 1990. A typical research project involves recording electron micrographs of the highest possible quality, subjecting them to digital image analysis to elicit the maximum amount of structural information, and interpretation, taking into account all pertinent complementary data. In this context, the LSBR has performed ground-breaking studies on cytoskeletal filaments, virus particles and antigens, and complex enzymes among other important biomedical specimens. The results achieved depend both on the quality of the primary data (electron microscope images) and the scope of computer analysis. Cryo-electron microscopy - the technique of visualizing organic specimens suspended in vitreous ice - was introduced in the 1980s and has revolutionized what is achievable. The LSBR has been to the fore in these advances and in 1997 accomplished the landmark result of extending the resolution on isolated complexes below 1 nanometer for the first time. In order to maintain the LSBR program at the cutting-edge of this research field, it is necessary to periodically upgrade the hardware used in the lab.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose<br /></span>Specifically, a major technical advance has been made with the recent introduction of large-format digital camera of much greater sensitivity and electron-collecting efficiency than was achieved in the previous generation of these instruments. Thus, the LSBR is in need of a 4k x 4k direct electron detection camera for capturing electron micrographs. Recent developments in electron microscope cameras have made direct electron detection a reality. With the elimination of the scintillator, the electron-to-light conversion layer necessary in typical CCD cameras, direct detection cameras promise unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. With the advent of this new technology, the prospect of recording low-dose, high-resolution electron micrographs digitally rather than on traditional film are becoming a reality. The lab will also benefit from a reduced need for silver-based photochemistry and a decreased dependence on EM film, which has become pricier and harder to obtain in recent years. Since the images recorded on such a device will be in a digital format, the time-consuming step of digitalizing (scanning) electron micrographs, as is currently done with traditional film, will be eliminated.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specifications of the Direct Electron Detection Camera</span>:</p>
<p>1. Must be compatible with a JEOL JEM 2200FS transmission electron microscope and capable of operating at electron energies up to 200keV.</p>
<p>2. Must be a direct electron detection camera with a back-thinned CMOS sensor of ~ 4k x 4k pixel format and allow direct acquisition of digital data under low dose (0.5 - 20 e-/&Aring;2 at the specimen) conditions.</p>
<p>3. The camera must be compatible with JEOL JEM 2200FS low dose data acquisition software with automatic beam blanking for the acquisition of both high-resolution cryo-EM images and tomographic tilt series of frozen, hydrated biological specimens using phase plates and zero-loss energy filtering.</p>
<p>4. Continuous full-frame read-out of 400 frames per second (fps) or greater in order to operate in electron counting mode, in which an image is constructed from the information in the images of individual incident electron events.</p>
<p>5. Must include all electronic and computational hardware and software necessary for inline event processing for single electron discrimination and ~ 8k x 8k sub-pixel centroiding at a rate of 400 fps * 4k x 4k pixels/sec (6.4 Gpixels/sec) or greater.</p>
<p>6. Camera performance [200 kV, Integrating Mode, where Nyquist is the outermost (highest resolution) spatial frequency sampled in the Fourier transform of the image]: Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) at 0.5 Nyquist &ge; 0.14, Detective Quantum Efficiency (DQE) at 0.5 Nyquist &ge; 0.22</p>
<p>7. Sensor must be of a radiation-hardened design such that the camera performance criteria of MTF &ge; 0.14 and DQE &ge; 0.22 (measured at 0.5 Nyquist for 200kV electrons) is maintained for a total cumulative sensor dose of at least 5 billion electrons/pixel.</p>
<p>8. Software shall be provided for camera control, image acquisition and image processing (e.g. DigitalMicrograph). The provided software should allow users to write programs, such as scripts, for the customization of camera control, image acquisition and image processing to accommodate user-specific applications.</p>
<p>9. The camera and associated software must be compatible with third party acquisition software such as SerialEM (D.N. Mastronarde, 2005. J. Struct. Biol. 152:36-51) and all modes of camera operation must be accessible to third party software.</p>
<p>10. Must be Peltier cooled with a sensor temperature of -20&deg;C or lower to reduce dark current.</p>
<p>11. Must have flexible sub-area readout, and support x2, x3, x4, x6 and x8 binning.</p>
<p>12. Must be on-axis, bottom mounted, and retractable and must accommodate future mounting of a Gatan US1000 CCD below the direct detector housing.</p>
<p>13. Must automatically retract whenever the microscope camera chamber is about to be vented.</p>
<p>14. The system shall include a secondary, 11 Mpixel or larger, CCD camera capable of &ge;14 frames per second for routine work such as searching and focusing.</p>
<p>15. Air, water, and electronic interface hardware for connecting the pneumatic insertion and extraction of the detector, water-cooling of electronics, and electronic and optical interfacing must be standard and included in the price of the camera.</p>
<p>16. Installation and on-site training of at least 3 days shall be provided by service engineers specifically qualified in the installation and use of this camera.</p>
<p>17. Vendor must disconnect and remove a Gatan Model 795 MSC CCD camera as trade in for &ge;$10,000 credit.</p>
<p>18. Warranty. The contractor warrants the instrument and all associated hardware, software, accessories and components for a period of at least two years. During this period, any and all upgrades to these items will be provided and installed free of charge.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern's name and address). Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>All capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Caitlin Savina, Contract Specialist, at caitlin.savina@nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by July 18th, 2011, 9:00 AM, EST. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the premier institution dedicated to delivering authoritative health information. NLM's mission includes collecting, organizing and disseminating biomedical information for the good of the public's health. The Library disseminates its information resources through many channels to try to reach all populations. One of the factors contributing to the striking disparity in the burden of illness and death experienced by minorities is a lack of awareness of where and how to access vital biomedical information. As scientific and medical breakthroughs are discovered, health care professionals, researchers, and consumers benefit from access to reliable, up-to-date medical information available quickly and conveniently.<br /><br />NLM proposes to partner with an organization that provides outreach to minorities and specifically to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for capacity building and technical assistance in a program with the main goal to improve access to and use of quality health information on the campuses and the surrounding communities. On campus, NLM wishes to reach HBCU faculty, staff and students in both academic and extracurricular settings. Use of NLM resources in courses, homework, student and faculty research, student health centers, or student clubs and other activities would be beneficial. In the community NLM wishes to foster collaborations with community organizations, faith-based organizations, and libraries. In addition to enhancing use of quality health information, NLM also wishes to promote health and medicine, both practice and research, as potential careers for students. By partnering with the NLM, the contractor will enhance the mechanisms of research and training at HBCUs through linking pre-health professional students and faculty to information, information technology and informatics research available at or through the NLM. <br /><br />Objectives<br /><br />The objectives of the program are to incorporate NLM information resources into HBCU courses and other activities; to increase awareness, knowledge, and use of NLM health information resources; to increase awareness and knowledge about health status and health disparities; and to increase the ability of HBCU faculty and staff to apply for and obtain NLM and other Federal funding. NLM does this with the recognition that using quality health information resources and understanding their benefits can assist communities in improving their health status. The program itself has several components and different objectives may apply to each of those. In addition to these overall objectives for the program, NLM recognizes that to be effective in the long-term, the sustainability must be built in to the appropriate components of the program. <br /><br />Project Requirements <br /><br />The proposed project is intended to bring NLM-sponsored health information access and training in information seeking and use to HBCU campuses. The overall annual program would consist of the following components (1) orientation and training of faculty and staff; (2) competition for funding; (3) conduct of funded projects; (4) technical assistance to award recipients; (5) reports by award recipients including oral presentation to NLM/the contractor staff and others.<br /><br />The orientation shall include an orientation to NLM and training in the use of significant NLM resources. The program shall include both demonstrations of NLM's resources and more formalized training in several resources that are likely to be most useful for this program.<br /><br />Additional orientation components may include segments that demonstrate ways campuses and communities would benefit from the information that is available through the NLM. These could include strategies for incorporating health information into relevant campus or community programs. They may also include information about health disparities, how to identify priority local health disparities, and how information may be incorporated into new or existing programs to combat these.<br />&nbsp;<br />Further components may include topics that would be useful for HBCU faculty or staff in preparing a proposal for funding or carrying out such a project. Topics might include project management, proposal writing, understanding the grants process, partnership development, participatory research, formulating a research question, conducting evaluation, writing for publication, sustainability, etc.<br /><br />This orientation may be carried out through in-person workshops or through electronic means such as webinars, online self-directed training, or any combination. However, there shall be a means to monitor participation in the orientation sessions, regardless of the format.<br /><br />The contractor shall prepare a solicitation for subcontracts of up to $20,000 each to enable HBUCs to carry out local projects on their campuses or in their communities. Information provided at the training workshops will assist HBCU faculty and staff to respond appropriately to the solicitation. Only HBCU institutions that had one or more representatives participate in the orientation and training shall be eligible for funding. <br /><br />The contractor shall develop formal proposal evaluation criteria which shall be reviewed and accepted by NLM prior to their implementation. The contractor shall then select and manage an independent review group to evaluate proposals and select the subcontractors. <br /><br />The award period shall be one year. The awards shall be made during the summer so that funding shall be available to the institutions for the beginning of the fall semester. The funded HBCUs shall be required to give oral presentations of their work in addition to standard quarterly and annual written reports. The contractor shall develop a standardized format for written quarterly and annual reports for the subcontracts. The oral presentations shall be part of the orientation and training for the following year's program and may be in-person or through electronic means. The method shall be determined by the contractor, with the approval of NLM each year.<br /><br />All materials, in any format, produced by the contractor related to this project, or produced by one of the subcontract award recipients shall include appropriate acknowledgement of the role of the National Library of Medicine, including the contract number. Any publications in peer-reviewed journals must be deposited in PubMed Central (see http://publicaccess.nih.gov/) <br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance<br /><br />The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from the date of award. An award is anticipated to be made on or about September 1, 2011. <br /><br />Other Important Considerations<br /><br />The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.

<DESC>This notice is made in accordance with FAR Part 5.203 and will account for the 15 day pre-solicitation issuance requirement. The anticipated release date for the solicitation is June 1, 2011. <br /><br />The Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), Office of Security Technology (ST) has a requirement for a qualified contractor to provide a robust, cradle-to-grave Supply Chain Management (SCM) service. ST envisions a holistic approach to supply chain, with a strong management infrastructure capable of integrating and managing the flow of products and information. The goal is multifold: to create a responsive, proactive and cost-effective supply chain capable of not only managing a catalog of more than five-thousand unique products and distributing them to over 147 domestic and 285 overseas DOS facilities with real-time visibility, tracking and accurate lead times; but to provide like services for any other items ordered in support of DOS critical needs. <br /><br />Due to the unique, sometimes dangerous and hostile locations of DOS facilities, ST must maintain the ability to apply cutting edge technology to new problems in information and personnel protection. The contractor will need to possess an expert knowledge of Technical Security Systems (TSS) in order to fulfill the technology development aspect of the supply chain. The objectives are for the SCM Contractor to:
<p>&bull;Ensure best value pricing of products and services;</p>
<p>&bull;Reduce the time to obtain products and services, ensuring predictable, consistent lead times;</p>
<p>&bull;Standardize staging of equipment for shipping and implementation;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide reliable, on schedule deliveries worldwide;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide customer's real-time visibility into the supply chain process;</p>
<p>&bull;Manage costs and obsolescence through equipment repair;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide technical assistance and life-cycle support to perimeter X-Ray, explosive detection equipment, and other specialized equipment;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide real-time order status, accurate delivery schedules, and delivery confirmation notices to the ordering activity and installation contractors, of any item ordered (not merely those noted in the aforementioned catalog);</p>
<p>&bull;Facilitate the customs process for in-country receipt of overseas shipments;</p>
<p>&bull;Identify and develop technology to improve technical security capability, minimize security vulnerabilities, and reduce costs;</p>
<p>&bull;Maintain the technical specification documents for TSS;</p>
<p>&bull;Test and evaluate identified commercial-off-the-shelf equipment or systems for approval or disapproval;</p>
<p>&bull;Identify and incorporate innovative, superior technology in DS-approved equipment and systems while staying abreast of new developments and technologies;</p>
<p>&bull;Conduct market research, product surveys, systems integration efforts, and product comparisons to ensure the best possible technology or solution is used;</p>
<p>&bull;If no commercial-off-the-shelf products are available, design and develop specialized technical security applications, equipment, and solutions as required with approval to support appropriate standards;</p>
<p>&bull;Develop, create and maintain documentation for customer requirements, technology needs assessments, concept of operations, system specifications, product test and evaluation, pilot project plans, equipment deployment, technical drawings, technical bulletins and new product bulletins;</p>
<p>&bull;Assist the DS Training Center to create and maintain training materials for new equipment;</p>
<p>&bull;Assist customers with troubleshooting and equipment deployment;</p>
<p>&bull;Research, evaluate, and present recommendations for new locking hardware;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide lock support and technical assistance, and</p>
<p>&bull;Maintain online document repositories that include equipment bulletins, deployment documentation, manufacturer's literature, and drawings.</p>
<p>This contract will be unique in that ST anticipates awarding three separate but critically related contracts to support the delivery and installation of TSS to domestic and overseas posts. Each Contractor shall be required to collaborate to create the most effective and efficient support organization for meeting ST goals. To ensure that product delivery is coordinated with installation, Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA) shall be required. ACAs shall be applicable for any portion of the contract that necessitates joint participation in the accomplishment of the Government's requirement. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is one (1) base year and four (4) one-year options. This requirement will be solicited using 100% full and open competition. The Government reserves the right to issue multi-type task orders for specific tasks approved by the Contracting Officer. Contractor performance will be measured in accordance with the metrics specified in each task order. The contract will be awarded utilizing the best value trade-off source selection methodology. This means that the offeror's plan of operation is more significant than cost. As technical merit of the Offeror's proposals become more equal, the evaluated cost or price may become the determining factor. The National American Individual Classification Standard (NAICS) code for procurement is 541614, Process, Physical Distribution and Logistics Consulting Services</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to possess a SECRET Facility Clearance at the time of proposal submission. The contractor must have the ability to obtain a TOP SECRET Facility Clearance.</p>
<p>After the solicitation has been posted, a date will be set for Vendor Questions to be proposed in writing to the Contract Specialist. Proposals are due&nbsp;thirty(30) days after the solicitation has been posted. The contract will be awarded within approximately&nbsp;forty-five&nbsp;(45) days after proposal submission.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: <br />This is a Sources Sought Synopsis, for market research purposes only, and not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.<br />The 700th Contracting Squadron (700 CONS) located at Rhine Ordnance Barracks, Germany is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for a one-time upgrade for the current HiPath system located at Ramstein AB (Germany). The upgrade is for the existing Siemens HiPath 4000 V2 switches to the latest Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certified software version (V5). The system will provide a JITC certified system with touch screen capability to support 521 AMOW Air Mobility Command Center (AMCC). The existing auxiliary equipment (hardware tech refresh) such as touch screen systems, memory modules, and UPS systems will also be replaced. The upgrade is to be performed on 14 consoles. 14 HiPath Trading licenses will be required to accomplish this task. A 2-year warranty is also desired.<br />A solicitation number has not been assigned to this action. Offeror must submit signed certification by the manufacturer that his/her enterprise is authorized to maintain, upgrade and repair systems of type HiPath 4000. Solicitation due date might be subject to change. Performance Work Statement and Solicitation will be published on FedBiZops for download. <br />
<p>The Government anticipates that a site survey&nbsp;will need to be performed prior to award. If a site survey is needed at no cost to the Government, will this change your quote?<br /><br />The anticipated award will have a performance period of approximately 160 days. The government expects to make an award in Sept 2011. Interested parties are requested to submit a statement of capability. The statement of capability shall include and shall not exceed 10 pages:<br />1. Contractor Name<br />a. Address<br />b. Point of Contact (POC)<br />c. POC phone number(s) and e-mail addresses<br />d. Cage code<br />Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary.

<p>The USCG Surface Logistics Training Center hereby gives notice of a sole source contract award to NACE International. Notice was not made prior to contract award due to the exception found at FAR 5.202 (a)(2). In accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.302-1, due to only one responsible source SFLC has placed a sole source contract award for NACE Coating Inspector Program - Level 1 Certification for USCG personnel. Full and open competition was precluded by this only one responsible source dute to unique capabilities including proprietary data and certification, as detailed in the attached Justification and Approval. Award was made under Contracting by Negotiation Procedures (FAR 15). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. A determination not to compete lies solely with the discretion of the Government. This announcement constitutes the only notice. The reference number is HSCG80-11-C-POE315. NAICS code for this purchase is 541990.</p>
<p>The following clause applies to this acquisition:</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
<p>Commandant (CG-9131)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St. SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692 <br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>
<p>The closing date for this notice is Monday, 18 JUL 2011. For more information contact Contract Specialist Bernie Caguiat at 510-637-5887 or e-mail at bernie.c.caguiat@uscg.mil.</p>

The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St. SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692 <br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>
