<DESC><p>This is a synopsis for a competitive services acquisition as required by FAR Part 5.2. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. VENDORS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT FORMAL PROPOSALS UNTIL THE RFP IS POSTED TO THIS WEBSITE. The Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AF ISRA) has been tasked to solicit for and award a project for AFTAC Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Analysis System (ANDSAS).

<p>The scope of work is as follows: non-personal services to develop, update, and maintain legacy, current, and future versions of AFTAC NDSAS that support mission requirements to detect, identify, and locate atmospheric and space NUDETs in near-real-time, and secondarily, integrate Research and Development (R&amp;D) applications developed by outside organizations that are logical extensions of AFTAC/TH requirements. These software capabilities support storage, retrieval and off-line analysis of satellite data processed by Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS) as well as data from any other atmospheric or exo-atmospheric remote monitoring and ground sensors. The contractor shall correlate multi-source data types for alert officer analysis during routine, alert, and exercise activities. The contractor shall develop tools for the creation/generation of simulated data for training, exercises, and validation of analytical tools. The contractor must demonstrate the capability to provide the following:</p>
<p>1)Working knowledge of nuclear weapon phenomenology for the development of algorithms</p>
<p>2)Extensive knowledge of satellite sensor operation and associated data processing</p>
<p>3)An understanding of requirements analysis and system and operational documentation in order to make recommendations for support of NDS Analysis System planning and decision making</p>
<p>4)Working knowledge of Sun workstation and server environment with UNIX operating systems</p>
<p>5)Ability to program in C++ and other languages in order to adapt to new sensor systems and ground processing systems while maintaining the TH legacy database (current TH system has about 3 million lines of code hosted on an Oracle database that requires management and real-time updates and goes back over thirty years).</p>
<p>6)Expertise in complying with DoD software development and sustainment requirements</p>
<p>7)Demonstrated software and system test and configuration control experience</p>
<p>8)Ability to use specific Atmospheric and Space analysis tools and applications</p>
<p>9)Top-secret facility clearance and personnel will require clearance at the top-secret level with a favorable DCID (Director Central Intelligence Directives) 6/4 eligibility determination and valid date for immediate access to SCI (sensitive compartmented information) material</p>
<p>SECURITY REQUIREMENT: Successful offeror will be required to provide on-site software development, operations, and sustainment support. The offeror must have the ability to have TS/SCI cleared personnel on-site to support ANDSAS requirements. In addition, offeror must demonstrate that the personnel are familiar with DoD security procedures for protecting classified material and working on secure systems at the Top Secret SCI, SECRET, and unclassified level in a controlled TS Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), as well as the ability and transportation to access a United States Air Force Installation. Personnel must have the ability to obtain an authorization to courier-classified data to and from secure facilities.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT (GFE): Access to government-furnished property and services will be limited to special purpose use in direct support of specific tasks performed in Building 989, Patrick AFB or in direct support of the ANDSAS at alternate locations. For work performed in Building 989, Patrick AFB, Florida, the Government will provide use and access to typical office and workspace, supplies, and services available at this location. For direct support of the ANDSAS at alternate locations, the Government will provide use and access to typical office and workspace, supplies, and services available at the location required to accomplish the task.</p>

Description:  The fuel nozzles are weldedassemblies that deliver carefully calibrated, precisely patterned fuelspray for combustion in a gas turbine engine.  The fuel nozzle consistsof a cover or inlet, check valve, cartridge valve, support, and meteringset.  Function:  The fuel nozzle assembly receives fuel through theinlet.  Fuel passes through the inlet strainer and accumulates in theportion of the support that houses the valves. The primary flow passesthrough the primary strainer and is directed through the check valve.It then passes through the inner tube of the support to the primary bodyof the metering set.  Fuel passes around the primary plug and throughthe primary body and enters the combustion chamber as a uniform density,cone shaped spray.  The secondary flow activates the flow dividercartridge valve.  This ports fuel through the restrictor orifice and theouter tube of the support to the shroud and secondary body of themetering set.  This fuel passes around the primary boy and through theshroud and secondary body and enters the combustion chamber as a uniformdensity, cone shaped spray.  The cone of the secondary spray is widerthan that of the primary and therefore surrounds the primary spraypattern.

Research funded by this task will focus on addressing the capacity challenges facing theUS national airspace.  It is forecast that over the next 15 years, air traffic in theUnited States will double, far exceeding the countrys current capability to safely flyaircraft. To handle this growth, NASA is contributing toward the development of the NextGeneration Air Transportation System (NextGen).This task supports the development and testing of air traffic control automation toenable fuel-efficient arrival operations during all traffic conditions, particularlyduring busy air traffic conditions where demand exceeds available airspace or airportcapacity. The operations enabled by the Efficient Descent Advisor (EDA) are characterizedby continuous aircraft descents at low engine power. Further enhancements to EDA are alsoexpected to reduce controller and pilot workload by minimizing the number of air trafficcontrol communications required in the arrival domain. This technology is being developedas a key capability for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). EDA isan existing software-based, decision-support tool intended for use by controllers workingin FAA en route air traffic control facilities. EDA generates speed, altitude and routeadvisories to allow airplanes to fly arrival trajectories that minimize fuel burn andenvironmental emissions, while keeping them safely separated from other traffic and incompliance with capacity constraints.  Under this task, the existing EDA software will beexpanded to incorporate a concept called 3D-Path Arrival Management (or 3D-PAM).Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.This announcement will not result in a Request for Proposal; this announcement is forinformational purposes only.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to add an option period for three existing contracts for Medicare banking. The three contracts to be extended are 1) HHSM-500-2009-00017C, Contract between CMS and J.P.

Additionally, this extension will allow the banks to keep current accounts open so that stale-dated checks can be processed, which should take 12 months or less.<br />The proposed period of performance is April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011. The total anticipated cost is expected to be $500,000 or less.

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to issue solicitation LCFDL10R7500 for the FEDLINK Books and Library Publications Acquisitions Program.  This Request for Proposals (RFP) is for services from vendors who can supply books and library publications (non serial publications) and associated acquisition support services to federal libraries, information centers, and other federal offices worldwide.  The services of serials subscription agents and the acquisition of commercial online electronic resources are covered under separate LC/FEDLINK contracts and are not the subject of this solicitation.  The RFP is divided into four lots which define four different but related aspects of books and library publications acquisitions: LOT 1   Firm Order Services; LOT 2   Approval Plan Services; LOT 3   Leasing Plan Service; and LOT 4   Technical and/or Order Processing Services.  LOT 1 is the core of this solicitation  VENDORS MUST QUALIFY UNDER LOT 1 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES UNDER OTHER LOTS.   LOT 1 Firm Order Services covers firm orders; a one time order for a specific title (or specific titles) and number of copies, in contrast to a subscription or standing order.   Under LOT 2,    Approval Plans, a vendor automatically supplies materials potentially required by a library as they are published, based on a detailed profile of the library's collection needs.  The library may return any publications deemed unsuitable for addition to the collection and is only billed for items retained.  Under LOT 3,    Leasing Plan Services, the customer leases publications from the supplier instead of buying them and retains an option to purchase leased items at a reduced price when the term of the lease is over.  Under LOT 4     Technical and/or Order Processing Services, the vendor may provide technical processing for materials supplied under this solicitation, performing physical processing or cataloging in order to supply materials to the customer in shelf ready condition.  The vendor may provide a computer based order processing system for the customer to make the acquisitions control process more efficient.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The RFP #LCFDL10R7500 will be posted on or about April 22, 2010. The anticipated closing date for RFP #LCFDL10R7500 will be on or about June 16, 2010.  Vendors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments to the solicitation are received and addressed prior to proposal submission.  All proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the instruction provided in Section L of the RFP.  All questions shall be submitted in writing and addressed to the Contracting Officer via email as specified.  All questions concerning the requirements of RFP shall be submitted prior to COB June 1, 2010.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS will be accepted.

<DESC>Arcata Associates, Inc. has a requirement for 2 each Newscaster van Transmitter RFHead Configuration, 1 each Newscaster Van Transmitter Controller, 1 each NewscoderReceiver, NYCOIL-QPT-VT7, and 1 each QPT-90 Controller.Arcata Associates, Inc. intends to purchase the items from NUCOMM 101 Bilby RoadHackettstown, NJ 07840 Nucomm is the only responsible source that is capable ofsatisfying the agencys unique need for the following reasons:The existing microwave system was designed, built, and extensively tested by Nucomm. Therefore, the new system from Nucomm will plug right in and not take any specialmodifications.	This will eliminate additional exorbitant cost of any other companyattempting to match this system.  Any other system would take special modifications thatwould cost more money and take more time to configure.	TV-2 has become unstable and itthreatens to not function during a mission critical event, up to and including the spaceshuttle.  This needs to be taken care of immediately.  To develop a new source, wouldencumber this effort and sustain substantial increase in cost and time.b.	Nucomm possess all the specifications necessary to ensure smooth operationwithout any interruption of service to our NASA customers.  This detail is not availableto any other vendor and to provide such would be a great burden to our daily functioning.Nucomm has the unpublished design, test and model data as well as the operatingexperience required to ensure success to this purchase.   To develop and demonstrateproficiency with this system for another vendor would take a prohibitively long amount oftime and jeopardize our operating efficiency.Any other company would have to develop many hours to comparable develop experience.We are only allowed special frequencies from our frequency manager.  Nucomm is the onlyvendor contacted that can provide these frequencies off the shelf. Nucomm is capable of providing the items necessary in the time frame needed.  This is ahigh priority project and installation is needed in a very short time frame.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:30 p.m. Pacific time on April 14, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely forthe purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitivebasis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a fulland open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within thediscretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH intends to negotiate on a non-competitive, sole source basis with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) to award a Follow-up Study from 2010-2015. The cited authorities are 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1. This effort will be a five year follow-up of the WHI participants.  This contractor has been involved in the recruitment, treatment strategies, follow-up, collection and analysis of data, and reporting of results on 161,808 participants from 40 clinical centers across the United States under the current contract number N01-WH-2-2110.  The incumbent contractor has the unique capacity to provide these required services to NHLBI for the follow-up of the study.  Inherent duplication of costs to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study.  The objectives of the study are detailed below.  

I. 	Background and Purpose of the WHI  

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) was established to elucidate the etiology and prevention of major causes of disability and death in older women (age range 50-79), namely cardiovascular disease, cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, and hip fractures. The program included three clinical trials in a partial factorial design (N=68,132) and a large observational study (N=93,677) for a total of 161,808 participants enrolled (17% minority). The program collected data on outcomes and exposures that span across most disease domains. During the first phase of the program (1993-2005) the three clinical trials and the concurrent observational study were completed. The trials of hormone therapy were stopped early, in 2002 for estrogen plus progestin because of harm for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), stroke, Venous Thrombo embolism (VTE) and breast cancer, and in 2004 for estrogen alone because of harm for stroke and VTE and lack of benefit for CHD. In an ancillary study, women over age 65 had an increased risk of dementia in both hormone arms. The trials of low fat dietary modification and of calcium and vitamin D continued to 2005 as planned.  

The currently ongoing renewal of WHI (2005-2010) enrolled 115,405 women (77% of those eligible) at 40 field centers. The post-stopping of therapy experience of the clinical trial participants in regard to trial exposures and clinical events are being monitored. The 3-year data after stopping estrogen plus progestin have been published, and the other trials will publish post-stopping data in 2010. The additional outcomes accrued in the observational study have been used to extend the clinical trial findings and are being utilized in several ancillary and consortium studies. The WHI data and biologic resources have been made widely available to the scientific community, and in particular two rounds of Broad Agency Announcements have funded 22 investigations utilizing the biologic samples. The current annual retention rate of the cohort is 98%.

II. 	WHI 2010-2015 Extension Study Objectives

A further 5-year observational WHI follow-up study is anticipated from October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2015.  During this time, all WHI participants will be invited to provide informed consent for continued follow-up of clinical outcomes, return of study questionnaires, and willingness to be approached for future ancillary studies including clinical trials. It is estimated that a total of ~100,000 women (85% of living participants, projected age range 62-95 with 35% over age 80) will enroll in the 2010-2015 extension. 

While it is well known that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of death in American women, it is less appreciated that the vast majority of these deaths occur in older women (women over the age of 80). They account for an increasing proportion of the CVD morbidity and mortality, and suffer from a number of important phenotypes, which include diastolic heart failure, hypertension, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation. Elderly women comprise the most rapidly growing demographic in the US population, yet only ~4,500 women over the age of 80 are currently being following in other NHLBI cohort studies. The WHI has a very large cohort of older women with a demonstrated enthusiasm for clinical research; the cohort is rich in clinical, phenotypic, and genotypic data; and it is supported by a strong research infrastructure. This follow-up takes advantage of the WHI cohort and its investigators to launch the next generation of critically important cardiovascular research projects that target older women. The renewal plans to continue support for following the cohort from 2010-2015, with several modifications to enhance its scientific value. The depth of the follow-up will be increased for two important sub-cohorts (hormone trial participants, and African American and Hispanic participants with Genome- Wide Association Study (GWAS) data, N~24,000, with ~8,400 over age 80) but will be scaled back to collect self-reported data only for the remaining (~76,000) participants from the other study trials and the observational study. In addition to the continued follow-up of the hormone trial participants to evaluate long term effects of treatment, both the hormone trial and minority populations will serve as observational studies with a new focus on three CVD outcomes with substantial burden in older women (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and venous thromboembolism) while continuing current adjudication of CHD, stroke, cancer, and other outcomes. The combined hormone trial and minority GWAS cohorts will have substantial minority representation (~28% African American, 12% Hispanic, and 58% White).  

The CCCs expected responsibilities that will continue during the follow up phase include (but are not limited to)  preservation of the WHI cohort and obtaining informed consent for ongoing participation; data management and analysis activities including the documentation and maintenance of appropriate confidentiality and security of files for the study and sub-studies; lead the development of the protocol and manuals of procedures development; continue to support a morbidity/mortality monitoring and adjudication system; maintain quality control and monitoring of the performance status of the field centers; maintain the biological specimen laboratory; solicit and monitor laboratories; coordinate, arrange, participate in, and provide any information necessary for regular Steering Committee, Observations Study Monitoring Board, training and other necessary study meetings; and provide technical reports as required by the Government.

The restructuring of the WHI field centers into up to 5 regional field centers will include funding for coordinating regional activities including, documentation of clinical outcomes, engaging investigators inside and outside current centers to propose analyses and ancillary studies, to perform distributed data analyses, and to train new investigators. Having a limited number of regional field centers will streamline study management and will facilitate ancillary studies within the region, and across regions, compared to having 40 field centers. 


This notice will close fifteen days from its posting. This is not a request for proposals (RFP). The estimated award date is April 1, 2011. All responsible sources may submit capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants and are encouraged to contact the Contract Specialist at least five business days prior to the close of this notice.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAIDs Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement to provide and develop animal models in order to advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as advance the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases.

 
NIAIDs role in developing medical products to counter emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases, as well as agents of bioterrorism, is part of a larger national strategy, involving multiple governmental agencies.  As such, NIAID supports integrated efforts in basic and applied research, product development, and technology development based on national priorities for medical products. Since 2001, NIAID has established a comprehensive infrastructure with extensive resources that support all levels of biodefense research.  With this solid framework of research and product development resources for biodefense in place, NIAID is now transitioning this infrastructure to provide the flexibility required to meet the challenges of emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases in addition to biodefense.

The use of animal models helps advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  For example, animal models are used to evaluate product candidates; provide data in support of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; guide the selection of human dose levels and the design of clinical studies/trials; and provide pivotal efficacy data for products to be licensed under FDAs Animal Efficacy Rule (21 CFR 314.610 and 601.91), when clinical trials are not ethical or feasible.  In addition, for emerging and rare diseases, understanding the disease in animals may provide relevant information when little can be learned directly from humans.  Therefore, DMID is committed to developing and providing animal models to benefit the research community and public health.

For the most part, animal model services are currently provided through multiple, specialized programs. DMID now seeks to adopt an integrated approach to the provision of services by creating unified, comprehensive, coordinated programs. This strategy is being employed to: advance science by promoting cross-fertilization across and within disciplines and approaches; serve the research community more conveniently; achieve efficient use of resources through economy of scale and avoidance of duplication; and provide the flexibility needed to respond to changing priorities. Accordingly, DMID is establishing the Animals Models of Infectious Diseases program, utilizing the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract mechanism.  

Under IDIQ contracts, base contract awards are made to multiple offerors that successfully propose a general approach to the technical requirements of the solicitation, providing a guaranteed minimum award. Task orders for specific tasks requiring specialized expertise are solicited and funded within the program Contractor pool. DMID is replacing multiple pathogen or class specific solicitations with one broad IDIQ solicitation for multiple contracts to cover all areas of current and potential future interests.  Animal models currently covered by existing pathogen-specific contracts will not be re-competed separately upon completion; however, they could be awarded as task orders under this program, upon expiration of those contracts.  

DMID is also establishing the Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Biological Research Resources (MID-BRR) program, which will serve as a central repository for microbiology and infectious disease researchers. The Animal Models of Infectious Diseases program will ensure a supply for the MID-BRR of pathogens that must be grown in animals and reagents integral to research on these organisms.

The Technical Requirements will be assembled into the following sections:

o	General Statement of Work, which specifies the basic technical requirements for all contracts.
o	Part Statements of Work, which specify additional technical requirements for contracts awarded to support each of four specific Parts:

Part A  Small Animal Models
Part B  GLP Small Animal Models
Part C  Non-Human Primate Models (+/- GLP)
Part D  Nontraditional Animal Models (+/- GLP)

Offerors may propose in response to one or more Part(s) of their choosing, and are not expected to respond to all Parts.  Offerors are also not expected to be responsible for all pathogens of interest or within scope for these contracts.  Offerors responding to multiple Parts must provide separate Technical and Business Proposals for each Part.  Proposals for each Part will be reviewed independently.  

For the purposes of this contract:
&#61607;	Small animals (Parts A and B) are defined as traditional small laboratory animal species, such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, chinchillas, and rabbits. 
&#61607;	Non-human primates (Part C) include various species, such as macaques, including Chinese and Indian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), cynomyologous macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina), etc.  Excluded are baboons and chimpanzees.
&#61607;	Nontraditional animals (Part D) are defined as specialty laboratory animal species not covered in Small Animal or Non-Human Primate Models (Parts A  C), which may have requirements not met in typical biomedical laboratory animal facilities, such as armadillos, woodchucks, snails, other invertebrates, and goats, swine, horses, cattle, etc.
&#61607;	Products to be evaluated in these animal models are broadly defined to include vaccines and other prevention strategies (e.g. microbicides), therapeutics targeting the host or the pathogen, including immunotherapeutics, and diagnostics.   Products will be provided to the Contractor by the Project Officer or a third party after Project Officer approval. 
&#61607;	Pathogens of interest must be pathogens of human concern and not only of animal concern; however surrogate human pathogen/animal combinations may be used for diseases where human pathogens cannot be studied in animal models.    
&#61607;	Pathogens are defined as bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, toxins, and other agents such as prions, including NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm). 
&#61607;	Reagents are defined as biochemical, genomic, molecular, cellular, and immunologic materials integral to research on these pathogens.

The following factors will be considered when evaluating proposals:

Technical Capability: adequacy and appropriateness of the general technical approach to animal model studies, to include conduct of product efficacy studies, animal model development, and supportive measurements (immunological, pharmacological, clinical, pathological, etc.); technical approach to pathogen production and characterization, including overall understanding of the pathogen and its behavior in animal models.  In addition, capability to comply with Good Laboratory Practices (21 CFR Part 58) will be evaluated for Part B, Part C and Part D.

Personnel and Project Management: adequacy, appropriateness and relevance of expertise, experience, qualifications, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity; adequacy and appropriateness of proposed organization and staffing to ensure efficient planning, initiation, implementation, conduct, and completion of all activities, including plans for communication and sharing of research resources.  

Facilities, Equipment and other Resources: availability of adequate, accredited animal facilities, with biocontainment appropriate for the pathogens proposed; availability of equipment necessary for the proposed animal studies; and adequacy of institutional biosafety program.

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a seven-year period of performance beginning on or about 
January 4, 2010.  

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 29, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

E-Mail Address: Megan.Replogle@va.gov  Place of Contract Performance: Contractor's office and Subcontractor's Examination officesSet-Aside Status: N/ADescriptionThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), through the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), administers the Compensation & Pension(C&P) Program for Veterans benefits, their dependents and their survivors. Entitlement determinations for disability compensation claims and disability pension claims are made by VBA Rating Veterans Service Representatives (RVSRs) working in VA Regional Offices (VAROs) across the country. A medical disability examination is a critical piece of evidence for determining the extent of permanent impairment, and the dollar benefit a Veteran is awarded. Congress enacted Public Law104-275, on October 9, 1996, which authorized VA to conduct a limited pilot program to contract for medical examinations from non-VA medical sources. This authority was used to service ten VAROs (Boston, Roanoke, Atlanta, Winston-Salem, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Diego, Houston, and Muskogee). The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a requirement to continue medical disability examinations from non-VA medical sources based on PL 104-275. The purpose of this requirement is to obtain high quality examination reports from responsible, responsive, and experienced contractors. The examination reports must provide essential information to support each disability diagnosed for the following areas: musculoskeletal; organs of sense; infectious, immune, and nutritional deficiencies; respiratory; cardiovascular; digestive; genitourinary; gynecological and breast; hemic and lymphatic; skin; endocrine; neurologic; mental disorders; dental and oral examinations. Offerors must be able to perform detailed medical disability examinations for veterans and separate service members within at least one of the following geographic areas:Eastern Region (Roanoke and Atlanta Regional Offices); Central Region (Houston and Muskogee Regional Offices); Western Region (San Diego and Los Angeles Regional Offices);National Region (Baltimore, Region Winston-Salem, Seattle, and Salt Lake City Regional Offices, which will include military bases participating in the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) and Disability Evaluation Systems(DES) programs in the Continental United states, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico.The Department of Veterans Affairs reserves the right to add additional military bases to the BBD or DES programs as necessary. The successful offeror shall comply with all applicable local state and federal laws including the privacy Act, 5 U.S.C 552a, and all agency privacy and security requirements. The Government intends to make multiple awards based on the above mentioned geographical regions as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contracts (ID/IQ) will have one 12-month base period with four 12- month options. The NAICS codes for this requirement are 621111 and 621112. This acquisition will be a full and open, unrestricted competition. The solicitation will be issued on or about April 20, 2010 with an anticipated close date of on or about May 20, 2010.

The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996)...(b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At leaset 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. (2) Supplies (other than procurement from a nonmaunfacturer of such supplies). The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials...Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR Clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. Additionally, AFMCFARS clause 5352.219-9001, "Use of Joint Ventures in Meeting the Limitations on Subcontracting Requirement (Nov 2007)" is planned for inclusion in the pending solicitation. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.<br />In accordance with AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101, the Ombudsman for ASC is Howard E.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business; 8(a), HUBZones small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Episode groupers are software programs that organize claims data into a set of clinically coherent episodes, usually linked by diagnoses. When the CMS episode grouper software evaluation began in 2006, the Agency had no experience with any of the episode grouper products and published research was very limited. Acumen studies (2007 and 2008) have found issues in grouping Medicare claims with existing episode grouping software. CMS is considering two approaches to obtaining a grouper for possible use in the Medicare program. Modifications to existing software could be explored in one approach (Approach A). Alternatively, new methods could be used to define a new episode grouper (Approach B).</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF ACTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this effort is to modify existing episode grouping software or design new software to meet Medicare needs.</p>
<p><br />Anticipated Period of Performance:</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the periods of performance will be as follows:</p>
<p>APPROACH A</p>
<p>The period of performance for the base period is 15 months from the date of award. The period of performance for the options is 24 months (two 1-year options) if exercised.</p>
<p>APPROACH B</p>
<p>The period of performance for the base period is 15 months from the date of award. The period of performance for the options is 48 months (four 1-year options) if exercised.</p>
<p><br />RESPONSE REQUESTED: CMS seeks responses from small businesses who may be available and capable of performing the work for the specified period of performance.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>

Installation Description

Creech Electric Distribution System:

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows:
Creech AFB is located about 45 miles northwest of Nellis AFB on U.S.95.
Creech AFB is home to the 432nd Wing, the Joint Unmanned Aircraft Systems Center of Excellence and the 99th Ground Combat Training Squadron.
The Creech AFB electric distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access.  The utility system is composed of, without limitation, switchgear, overhead and underground conductors, utility poles, ducts, manholes, pad-mount and pole-mount transformers, meters, instrumentation, street lighting fixtures, and other ancillary fixed equipment related to electricity delivered to end users on the Installation.
Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are: Airfield Lighting, Parking lot lights serviced by secondary feed from a building, water tower lights and emergency generators that exist for the purpose of emergency back-up for AF facilities.  
A new NV Energy owned substation, constructed in 2005, supplies Creech AFB with power. The base is predominantly comprised of underground conductors, with few energized overhead conductors remaining.  Transformers currently provide two underground circuits,  one to the Weapons Storage Area (WSA) and one which crosses Runways 08/26 and 13/31 to the east side of the base.  The loop around the base has been installed to replace the existing 4160 volt circuits with 12,470 volt circuits.  63 Alpha and Point Bravo are also supplied power by NV Energy.
NV Energy provides power to the NV Energy owned substation.   
Annual Consumption, FY09 is 19,335,841 KWH with a monthly average usage for FY09 of 1,611,320 KW

<DESC>NASA Request For InformationFeasible Technologies And Tools For The Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Of Friction StirWelded (FSW) ComponentsIntroductionThe Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) team supportsMSFC spaceflight hardware by using the best available NDE tools, which are applied tomaterials and structures to verify the required integrity and to detect characteristicflaws, discontinuities, and other defects in a structure or component, not normallydetectable by the naked-eye, in such a manner that the test does not harm the material inany way. This evaluation of a part or component is accomplished without causing physicalor chemical changes to the part or component, or otherwise impairing its adequacy foroperational service. This capability spans both metallic and composite/non-metallicmaterials and structures.Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid-phase method to join two metal surfaces withoutmelting. It uses frictional heating combined with high forging pressure to producehigh-strength bonds. The technique does not create toxic fumes, requires no consumables,and allows welds to be made on aluminum alloys that cannot be readily fusion arc welded. Because of these advantages, as well as the adoption of aluminum-lithium alloycombinations (2195/2195 and 2195/2219), NASA has begun using FSW in more construction inthe past decade. However, the technique is open to new and difficult to diagnose defectsin the welded materials.The NDE team is seeking to improve its capabilities to detect FSW defects, particularlylaminar-type and low-volume defects. Sub-surface tears and kissing bonds are currentlythe two largest challenges for the NDE team; however improved detection is desired forall types of defects. Because much of the NDE work is done in the field, the team is alsoseeking techniques and instruments that will enable improved field-testing.In order to facilitate a better understanding of how defects are created during variousFSW techniques, a study is being planned to help determine how the defects affect thewelded material and which defects are mission-critical subsequently causing breach of thepressure vessel and catastrophic loss of the vehicleScope of ActivityThe MSFC NDE Team is soliciting information through this RFI for FSW defects data.  Thisinformation will be used in support of the analysis, design, manufacturing and testing ofcurrent and future work for launch vehicles, spacecraft, and associated subsystemsinvolving FSW. NASA is seeking existing FSW effects of defects data that encompasses the materials andweld types, thus saving the Agency the time and expense of recreating this defect data. Desired Technical InformationThe three specific techniques seeking information on are self-reacting friction stirwelding, conventional friction stir welding and friction plugs. The alloys used arealuminum-lithium alloy combinations (2195/2195 and 2195/2219). The alloys thicknessesrange from 0.25 to 0.60. The MSFC NDE Team has specific interest in the following technical information:	Types of defects created during friction stir welding, self-reacting frictionstir welding, and plug welding	Methods of detecting and evaluating the size, depth, etc. of the defects	Methods of creating specific defects with consistency (volume, cluster, depth,etc.). 	Variety of tests and methods to determine what constitutes a critical effect ontest material 	Any type of commercial-off-the-shelf applications and software for FSW defectdata 	Potential industries benefiting from and industry uses for defect data 	Summary of resources including networks, background and experience of personnel,facility descriptions, or other assets that might be used to support the MSFC NDE Teamrelative to the application of NDE processes and techniques used in FSW defect data.	Description of available facilities for the creation of FSW defect test panelswith a minimum length of 24 inches to be used by the MSFC NDE Team.ResponsesOrganizations able to supply relevant information should submit such information no laterthan 11:59 PM Central Standard Time, on April 30, 2010. RFI submissions will be acceptedas email attachments only, addressed to shaun.w.canter@nasa.gov with FSW RFI Responsein the subject line. The file format should not exceed 15 pages, should use single space,12-point, Times New Roman format. The following file naming convention should be used;Friction Stir Welding RFI.Although all comments received will be carefully reviewed and considered for inclusion inany possible later Agency action, the Government does not desire to enter into a formalcontractual arrangement at this time.  Respondents will not be notified of the results ofthe review.NASA will not publicly disclose proprietary information obtained as a result of the RFI.To the full extent that it is protected by law and regulations, information identified bya respondent as Proprietary or Confidential will be kept confidential.

<DESC>U.S. MERCHANT MARINE ACADEMYQUALITY STANDARDS SYSTEM
BACKGROUND;  There are at least three equally important and converging requirements that indicate the need for a Quality Standards System (QSS) at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA).  
Firstly, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), the college's accreditation body, states a number of requirements in its Characteristics of Excellence that ranslate to a system of standards, pliicies and procedures for the operation of an accredited college.  
Secondly, the GAO Report GAO-09-6365 of August 20-09 identified a nuber of internal controls that need to be implemented at the Academy.  An overarching quality system needs to be in place to monitor progress in these endeavors and to ensure positive and lasting results into the Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, as amended, sets qualification standards for masters, officers and watch personnel on seagoing merchant ships.  The STCW and Dpocumentation (MLD( program and are set forth in Federal Regulations.  The USMMA must comply with these regulations.  46 C.F.R. Part 10.107 states the following:
	Quality Standard System or QSS means an organization of policy, procedures, processes, and data working together to establish and fulfill its objectives.  A QSS is a required component of any enity offering STCW training, assessment of compentence, certification, endorsement and/or revalidations of activities.
SCOPE.  To support trhe US Merchant Marine Academy in the development of a Quality Standard System (QSS) that will satisfactorily address the converging issues referred to in the background section thus satisfying the demands of the GAO Report, the MSCHE Standards found in the Characteristics of Excelleence, and the relevant ISO 9000 standards yet uniquely different in that it will incorporate, where possible, already existing standards, policies and processes put in place by the Academy.
The support envisioned here will consist of an auudit of existing quality standards in relevant areas of Academy operations and management, identification of existing weakbesses and strengths and the development with Academy personnel, of a QSS model that sddresses the institution's needs.
MUST BE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION (ISO) 9000 CERTIFIED.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY TO PREQUALIFY VENDORS. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The United States Senate Office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA) requires technical services for post production support of the Senate Recording Studio (SRS) server system.</p>
<p>The SRS Server System is a mission critical system that is used to ingest, playback, edit, and archive most of the content produced by the SRS. The SRS Server System is a highly integrated system comprising hardware and software products supplied by several companies. The SRS is seeking support services under this Contract that bridge the support services from the individual companies for their respective products that constitute the SRS Server System. The companies supporting the SRS Server System are listed in the Requirements Section below.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>This project is limited to services related to support requests concerning the SRS Server System. The Contractor must have hands on experience with each of the third party vendors listed below and experience with systems that have integrated the listed hardware and software systems.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of the major products and systems from third party vendors and manufacturers which are integrated within the SRS Server System.</p>
<p>Trans Media Dynamics (TMD)</p>
<p>TMD serves as the central point of control and management for the entire Server System. TMD acts as the media asset management (MAM) system for the SRS. At the core of this MAM is a customized and robust Oracle database, to track all assets as they move through the system. TMD controls the movement of assets from the time they enter the system to being moved to archive. TMD also provides a custom interface to the Browser Services, using the IPV platform of software and hardware.</p>
<p>Omneon</p>
<p>The on-line storage consists of the Omneon Spectrum storage system. The Spectrum provides the central storage repository for all content ingested to the MAM system.<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY TO PREQUALIFY VENDORS. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The United States Senate Office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA) requires technical services for post production support of the Senate Recording Studio (SRS) server system.</p>
<p>The SRS Server System is a mission critical system that is used to ingest, playback, edit, and archive most of the content produced by the SRS. The SRS Server System is a highly integrated system comprising hardware and software products supplied by several companies. The SRS is seeking support services under this Contract that bridge the support services from the individual companies for their respective products that constitute the SRS Server System. The companies supporting the SRS Server System are listed in the Requirements Section below.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>This project is limited to services related to support requests concerning the SRS Server System. The Contractor must have hands on experience with each of the third party vendors listed below and experience with systems that have integrated the listed hardware and software systems.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of the major products and systems from third party vendors and manufacturers which are integrated within the SRS Server System.</p>
<p>Trans Media Dynamics (TMD)</p>
<p>TMD serves as the central point of control and management for the entire Server System. TMD acts as the media asset management (MAM) system for the SRS. At the core of this MAM is a customized and robust Oracle database, to track all assets as they move through the system. TMD controls the movement of assets from the time they enter the system to being moved to archive. TMD also provides a custom interface to the Browser Services, using the IPV platform of software and hardware.</p>
<p>Omneon</p>
<p>The on-line storage consists of the Omneon Spectrum storage system. The Spectrum provides the central storage repository for all content ingested to the MAM system.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This sources sought is issued by the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a formal solicitation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a formal solicitation, RFP or Broad Area Announcement (BAA).  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this sources sought and all costs associated with responding will be solely at the interested parties expense. Not responding to this sources sought does not preclude participation in any future and potential solicitation, or RFP.  It is the intent of NGIC to use this for market research purposes only. If a formal solicitation is released, it will be issued via the Federal Business Opportunities (http: //www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this website for any information that may pertain to this sources sought.  The information provided in this sources sought is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.<BR><BR>The TMAP was developed by the Intelligence Production Centers (IPC), working collectively, to address the shortfalls in the analytical process that supports the production of scientific and technical intelligence.  The TMAP implementation plan, collectively developed and approved by the participating Centers, calls for each participating Center to develop and implement its own TMAP program.<BR><BR>TMAP is a standardized methodology for performing weapon system analysis, and for capturing the analytical results in a common format that can be easily shared among analysts and support conversion into customer-specific simulation or database formats.  The central tenet of the TMAP concept is the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software wherever possible to improve the IPC analytic processes. The decision to choose COTS over a government-derived solution was driven by the ready availability of needed capability in existing COTS products.   Where COTS products are not appropriate, existing government solutions are preferable to new development.  <BR><BR>The primary components of the COTS solution set are MATLAB, Simulink and the Real-Time Workshop.  Thus weapon system models built under the TMAP program and this contract will mainly be built using that software.  It is the resulting weapon system models, however, that form the basis of the TMAP toolset and will provide the means by which analysts can conduct their assessments, share results and satisfy customer requirements.<BR><BR>The TMAP toolset will be used to improve the IPCs analytic production process in five major areas. These areas include: (1) the development of analytic tools that are used to analyze raw intelligence data; (2) the development of analytic tools that can be used to generate results that can satisfy many routine production requests; (3) supplementing and complementing existing characteristics and performance databases; (4) helping meet customers modeling and simulation needs; (5) improving how the IPCs support the validation of customers threat models.<BR><BR>The following organizations are participating in the TMAP:<BR><BR>ACRONYM	            NAME				LOCATION<BR><BR>NGIC	National Ground Intelligence Center	    Charlottesville, VA<BR>NCMI	National Center for Medical Intelligence    Ft. Detrick, MD<BR>MSIC	Missile and Space Intelligence Center	    Redstone Arsenal, AL<BR>NASIC	National Air and Space Intelligence Center  Wright Patterson AFB, OH<BR>ONI	Office of Naval Intelligence		    Suitland, MD<BR><BR><BR>C.2	OBJECTIVE<BR>The NGIC has the mission to assess the capabilities and intentions of current and future foreign ground forces, as limited by weapon systems and technologies, for US acquisition, operational and policy-making customers.  Customers are both internal and external and have a need for modeling related to foreign ground force weapon systems (e.g., tanks, artillery, helicopters, transports, mines, ammunition, rockets, tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, jammers, communications equipment, C4I systems) and system components for which NGIC is responsible.  This contract provides external assistance to apply modeling and simulation (M&S) tools and techniques in accomplishing this mission.<BR><BR><BR>C.3	SCOPE<BR>The scope of work falls into two categories.  The first addresses the need for design, production and testing of selected foreign weapon system models to be used as an intelligence baseline for defining threat systems and customization or enhancement of new or existing foreign ground force weapon system models to meet specific external customer requirements.  The second category addresses the need to integrate new or existing foreign ground force weapon system models with databases, with models produced outside of this contract, or with hardware- or human-in-the-loop systems.  <BR><BR><BR>C.4	TASKS<BR>The following represent the needs of NGICs TMAP program.  The contractor shall provide the services specified below in accordance with applicable Task Orders (TO) in the task areas identified in the paragraphs below.  Each task will be conducted in a phased approach to facilitate scheduling and oversight and to minimize risk.  The phases are as follows:<BR>"	Phase 1:  Study.  This phase includes problem domain definition and identification of requirements and any risks associated with completing the task.  The contractor shall present the results of the study in a formal requirements document that describes the problem domain; the design, function and performance requirements for individual models; and any identified risks.  The government will verify that the contractor has correctly captured the problem definition and requirements.<BR>"	Phase 2:  Design.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>I. Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>A. Agency: 366 SFS/S4R, Mountain Home AFB ID</p>
<p>B. Contracting Activity: 366 CONS/LGCA2, Mountain Home AFB ID</p>
<p>II. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: The proposed contracting action discussed in this justification is to create a new purchase order with the current contractor for Vindicator Alarm Maintenance for a period of 2 months.</p>
<p>A. The proposed purchase order would take effect upon the expiration of the current purchase order, which expires 31 Mar 10. The new purchase order will be for the 2-month period of 1 April 10-31 May 10.</p>
<p>B. Current Contract Particulars:</p>
<p>1. Contract Number: FA4897-09-M-8002</p>
<p>2. Description: Vindicator Alarm Maintenance at Mountain Home AFB ID</p>
<p>3. Contract Type: Firm-fixed price</p>
<p>4. Period of Performance: 1 October 2008-31 March 2010</p>
<p>5. Contract Value: Total estimated value $234,655.00<br /><br />III. Description of Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: The proposed purchase order would provide all necessary labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, and materials to support the Vindicator Alarm Maintenance required on Mountain Home Air Force Base (AFB). The contractor shall repair and maintain all Vindicator Alarm Maintenance, must have and produce for verification, Vindicator Intrusion Detections System, Vindicator Command and Control System, and Vindicator Access Control Systems, installation and maintenance certification. The government's requirements have not changed from those on the current contract. The contractor has informally indicated they will agree to provide the same prices currently being used on Purchase Order FA4897-09-M-8002 for this acquisition; therefore, the estimated value of the proposed purchase order is $33,952.84.</p>
<p>IV. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: FAR 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a Single Source</p>
<p>V. Demonstration that the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:</p>
<p>A. The current contractor, Integrated System Specialist, Inc. (ISS), a small business, has held the contract since 1 Oct 08 and has all of the parts, materials, equipment, and licenses to continue performing the contract. The original contract, FA4897-09-M-8002, was awarded and prices were determined to be fair and reasonable based on competition. ISS has indicated they will agree to a new 2-month purchase order at the current price. ISS's performance has been excellent since the contract began, resulting in the security needs of the base to be met.<br /><br />1. Experience has shown that it takes several months for a new Vindicator Alarm Maintenance contractor to transition into a new contract, obtaining all of the resources, licenses, and base-specific knowledge it takes to provide consistently smooth, quality service. If another source could be found that would be willing to accept the contract for 2 months, the security of the base would certainly suffer due to the learning curve a new contractor would face on such a complex contract and the potential delay in obtaining all necessary resources and licenses to perform the contract.</p>
<p>2. By the time a new contractor completed the transition, a 2-month contract would nearly be completed. In this day of continuous and lengthy deployments of our military members, it is of utmost importance to provide them with good, consistent, uninterrupted service to the extent possible.</p>
<p>B. Even if an additional source could be found, the contract price would certainly be much higher than the estimated cost of the purchase order in order for a new contractor to recover all of its costs for providing the necessary parts, materials, equipment, licenses, etc, in the 2-month contract period.</p>
<p>VI. Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offers are Solicited: A notice will be published on Fed Biz Ops stating the government's intention to issue a sole source purchase order for a 2-month purchase order.</p>
<p>VII. Determination by Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost will be Fair and Reasonable: The solicitation for the last competed contract resulted in receipt of two proposals. ISS, whose price was determined fair and reasonable based on competition, was chosen as the successful offeror. There have been no increases in contract price since the contract started. Since the contractor has informally proposed the same prices for a new 2-month contract until the new 5-year contract is awarded, the anticipated cost of the proposed purchase order will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>VIII. Description of Market Research Conducted and Results: A notice for the previous purchase order was published on Fed Biz Ops stating the government's intention to issue a sole source purchase order for 2 months. There were no inquiries to the sole source notification</p>
<p>IX. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: Writing a new purchase order to the current Vindicator Alarm Maintenance contractor for 2 months would be most advantageous to the government because of the cost savings. A 2-month purchase order with the current contractor will save the government the startup costs a new contractor would include during this phase in period. If a new contractor was awarded this 2 month purchase order they would most certainly build all of their costs into this period, resulting in an unreasonably high contract price, where the current contractor has already incurred these costs. Therefore, ISS is the only source that could provide the require services at a reasonable price for the 2-month period between the current contract expiration date and the issuance of the new 5- year contract.</p>
<p>X. List of Sources that have Expressed Written Interest in the Acquisition: No sources have expressed written interest in performing the Vindicator Alarm Maintenance contract for only 2 months.</p>
<p>XI. Action to Remove or Overcome Barriers to Competition for Subsequent Acquisition: If approval is granted to award a 2 month purchase order to the current contractor, there would be no need to remove or overcome any barriers to competition.</p>
<p>XII. Technical Certification/Personnel Certification: I certify the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete.</p>
<p><br /><br />____//SIGNED//____________________________<br />JEFFERY A. WATERS, Civ<br />Resource Advisor</p>
<p><br />XIII. Contracting Officer's Certification: The contracting officer's signature below represents a certification the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>Peptides are central to numerous research efforts at the Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) due to their extensive sequence landscape, chemical diversity and broad range of functionality.  There are currently five on-going research projects which require peptide synthesis with additional project anticipated. The Government expects this need for peptide synthesis to continue for a number of years. To date, each project has identified the need for peptide synthesis work as it occurs; and separate orders/contracts have been awarded for peptide synthesis.  With the modification to the procurement procedures, the past approach has become time consuming leading to delays which has been impeding progress to individual projects.<BR><BR>This Request for Information should be considered an open call for providing the government peptide synthesis needs. The Government requires two general classes of peptide synthesis: (1) linear peptide synthesis; and (2) cyclized peptide synthesis.  Additionally, the Government may require peptide arrays.  This performance-based service contract incorporates the following performance objectives:  (1) Synthesize peptides with specified sequence and purity (2) adherence to contract schedule, milestone, and delivery requirements, and (3) efficient and effective cost control.  The contractor's primary focus shall be to synthesize peptides based on the Governments specified sequence and purity.  The specific sequence, purity and quanity for each delivery order will be include on the individual delivery order.  All peptide synthesis shall include reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry analysis.  A certificate of analysis shall be required with each shipment.  In addition, peptide arrays will require peptides to be uncoupled, in individual containers with a purification step. It is the contractors responsibility to employ the necessary resources to ensure accomplishment of these objectives.  The government expects some face-to-face contact to ensure some specific requirement are understood and successfully accomplished, therefore we are looking for contractors who are local to the NSRDEC.<BR>

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to solicit on a sole-source basis to Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523. The requirement is for support to the Sedimentation and River Hydraulics Group (SRHG) of Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) on the application of and training in hydraulic and sediment transport computer models to several Reclamation Projects. The Sedimentation and River Hydraulics Group (SRHG) of Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is responsible for complex analyses of river processes and water operations. SRHG have developed one-dimensional and two-dimensional models of flow, sediment transport, and vegetation to analyze these processes. The one-dimensional model is called SRH-1D (Huang and Greimann, 2007) and the two-dimensional model is called SRH-2D (Lai, 2008).  These models require detailed knowledge of numerical modeling and river processes to apply.  They also require frequent modification to address site specific conditions and to include the most current and accurate methods available.  SRHG is requesting assisting in the application of these models and training for these models.
Training and application of SRH-1D requires intimate knowledge of the computer code and in the physical processes it is intended to simulate. It is for use on natural river systems that are highly complex and application of the model often requires modification of the code to address site specific conditions and to address each project's specific needs. 
Another requirement for support is the ability to use the results of Global Climate Change (GCMs) models to estimate changes to sediment delivery to reservoirs. This requires detailed knowledge of watershed models and sediment transport. It also requires the ability to write programs and scripts within the LINUX operating system.
Therefore, contractor must meet the following requirements:
1. Demonstrated experience in the development of SRH-1D;2. Demonstrated programming experiment on UNIX and/or LINUX platforms;3. Ph.D. level education in sediment transport and river hydraulics; and 4.Over 2 years experience in the application of computer models to river hydraulics and sediment transport.
Colorado State University, Department of Civil Engineering, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523 is the only known source meeting the above requirements. Dr Jianhcun (Victor) Huang a Research Scientist employed by Colorado State University, Department of Civil Engineering has been the primary developer of SRH-1D (Huang and Greimann, 2007) and has over 8 years of experience developing and applying the model. 
Competition is restricted to only one source per FAR 13.106-1(b). This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures at FAR Part 13 with an intended period of performance of April 15, 2010 - October 31, 2010. Anticipated award date is April 13, 2010. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement by 12:00 pm MDT, April 9, 2010 which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) is seeking interested sources with the capabilities to supply green versions of various solvents, industrial cleaners, absorbents, chemicals, packaged petroleum, lubricants, and oils (Federal Supply Classes 6810, 4235, 6850, and 9150).  DSCR is planning for several long-term, support arrangements.

DSCR will host a Green Industry Day on 10 June, 2010.  This Industry Day will be held at the Community Recreation Center from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, EST.  The major topics for discussion will be to provide details on how the EPA and DoD, specifically DLA, support initiatives for procuring products that are defined as energy efficient, water-conserving, bio-based, made with recovered content, or have other positive environmental attributes.  DSCR also expects to provide information to foster possible teaming between DLA customers and industry, and to explain the NSN establishment process within the DLAs confines for any new green products.

<DESC>RECOVERY (ARRA)Contract # 40181RM053Awarded to: Summit Helicopters Inc.  DUNs # 054816616Cloverdale, VAAward amount: $105,000.00Date of Award: March 17, 2010
The goal of this project is to restore wetland swales on approximately 690 acres within Florida Scrub Jay Habitat Reserves at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge.  Previous fire suppression actions allowed grass swales to become invaded by woody vegetation.  This project will remove the woody vegetation, allowing the emergent grasses to return.  The project includes aerial application of herbicides to treat hardwood trees and shrubs within wetland swale marshes.  The contractor will use a helicopter to accurately treat vegetation in narrow linear marshes within the scrub landscape.
A Time & Material contract was awarded due to the work area being large and difficult to access, which was difficult to accurately map treatment sites.  Contractors would have a difficult time visually assessing the amount of vegetation which would need to be treated.  If this contract were fixed price, many contractors would be discouraged from bidding due to inability to fully assess what work is actually required, or alternatively, they may have significantly increased their prices to take into consideration  potential risk (of underbidding).  A Time & Materials contract will provide the flexibility to maximize the use of available funds and allow treatment of the most problematic areas.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to extend, on a sole source basis, the Ordering Period of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with The Boeing Company, St. Louis, MO (Boeing) under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The ceiling amount for this contract is $500M, of which&nbsp;$304M has been utilized. NAWCTSD intends to extend the contract's existing Ordering Period by five (5) years.
<p>As the design cognizant activity and builder of the in-production F/A-18 E/F Aircraft and EA-18G variant, Boeing alone maintains the engineering expertise required to design, build and deliver high fidelity F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers to meet critical aircrew and maintainer training requirements that occur concurrently with the introduction of the aircraft into the fleet.</p>
<p>Boeing, through their Flight Simulation division, is funded by the F/A-18 E/F Aircraft and EA-18G Programs to create aircraft systems software and modify aircraft Software Configuration Sets (SCS) for engineering simulations that are used in the development of the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G aircraft. These newly created and modified SCS software models are then reused in the development of F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G training systems.</p>
<p>As part of the aircraft procurement program, Boeing developed and built the existing F/A-18 E/F Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers and are currently responsible for design, fabrication, integration, documentation, shipping, installation and testing of upgrades to specific trainers. Under the EA-18G Aircraft Program, Boeing mirrors this effort and builds EA-18G Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers. The extended Ordering Period of this contract is for the continued procurement of new F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G trainers and training systems and upgrades to existing trainers and training systems. The training systems' requirements include incorporation of all ongoing aircraft engineering change proposals (ECPs), SCS updates, and incorporation of major subsystems identified in the aircraft development roadmap that impact aircrew and maintenance training.</p>
<p>The trainers and training associated with the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G aircraft are designed and developed based on data derived from parallel and spiral efforts contracted with Boeing under the aircraft procurement programs. The trainers will require incorporation of advanced and emerging technologies specific in design or application to the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G aircraft. F/A-18 E/F trainers and EA-18G trainers require the use of technical and operational information that is not readily available to other vendors during design and development. Only Boeing has access to the requisite aircraft design data, aircraft specific software, and simulated models. Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current and future aircraft designs, awards through competitions would require substantial duplication of costs that the Government would not recover through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the F/A-18 E/F's and EA-18Gs's mission training requirements scheduled through July 2015.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice that outlines the Government's intent to extend the Ordering Period for an existing sole source IDIQ contract. However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, ability to obtain F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G technical data, and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Robert Orozco (robert.orozco@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 15 April 2010. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than FIVE (5) pages. A determination by the Government not to extend the Ordering Period of this contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to pursue conducting a competitive procurement. No solicitation document is available. If no affirmative written response is received, the ID/IQ contract's Ordering Period for the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers and trainer modifications will be extended without further notice.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in Orlando, FL intends to extend the ordering period and raise the ceiling on contract N68936-05-D-0042 with SoBran Incorporated. This increase is necessary due to unanticipated and substantial changes to the future requirement. The additional time is necessary to define the requirement, conduct sufficient market research and allow for uninterrupted performance until a follow-on contract can be awarded. This contract is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity with Time and Material Provisions for production support services to augment the Government workforce in support of the Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) mission at the Fleet Readiness Center - Southeast (FRCSE). The current ordering period will expire on 30 September 2010. This increase will cover a period of 10 months until the follow on contract is awarded in June 2011, with a two (2) month mobilization period. Therefore, the requirement being synopsized here is a 10 month requirement. This sole source action is being requested in order for the FRCSE to have uninterrupted services until the recompeted contract is awarded. <br />
<p><br />Any firms believing they can provide these services may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice. It must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy or reliability of the services provided and without causing an interruption of critical services. The firm's response should also illustrate how it can overcome the start-up costs necessary to assume this effort in the short period of performance that this synopsis represents.</p>
<p><br />The contract was originally solicited as a competitive procurement action pursuant to FAR 19.5. The NAICS Code is 561210 and the FSC/PSC Code is J015. The procurement was a 100% set-aside for small business firms whose revenue does not exceed $35.5M.</p>
<p>If firms are interested in the follow-on effort, an additional Sources Sought is anticipated to be released in September 2010 reflecting the changes made to the requirement. Send inquiries to: charles.hargett@navy.mil (Preferred Method) OR by mail to: NAWCTSD Attn: Mr. Charles Hargett, Code 25332, Orlando, FL 32826, OR Fax to: 407-380-4164.</p>

<DESC>This is a NOTICE to communicate the Transportation Security Administration's intent to enter into a lease with Kent County Department of Aeronautics for space at the Gerald Ford International Airport (GRR), 5500 44th Street, SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49512 on a SOLE SOURCE basis. This is a continuing requirement and follow-on effort, TSA has occupied space in this airport since 2002. The period of performance will be a total of five (5) years; one 12-month base period with four 12-month option periods.
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. TSA employs more than 45,000 security screeners and provides guidance and training to flight crews for dealing with threats on board aircraft. Since February 17, 2002, TSA has been responsible for civil aviation security functions. Because these tasks are directly related to the screening of passengers at the airport, this space must be located on airport property. <br /><br />The Transportation Security Administration currently occupies a total of 3,393 square feet at Gerald Ford International Airport; 2,817 square feet in Terminal 2 Concourse and 576 square feet in Concourse B. These spaces are used for training, administrative and break room purposes by TSA staff.<br /><br />The Transportation Security Administration intends to negotiate with only one source; no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement. Therefore, proposals will not be accepted directly to this requirement.</p>
<p>This lease will be negotiated with the Kent County Department of Aeronautics and ultimately awarded without further notice.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Commercial Items. The authority for this award is FAR 13.106-1 (b) (1)  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  

The Solicitation number is: OPM020-10-R-0001 and is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-39 dated March 19, 2010.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 518210, and the small business size standard is $7.0 million. 

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a requirement for ongoing on-line employment information services for a period of eighteen months (One-year base period plus one six-month option period) to begin July 29, 2010. OPM will issue a non-competitive award that will result in a contract to the incumbent, Monster Government Solutions (MGS) located at 5 Clocktower Place, Suite 500, Maynard, MA 01754. The current contract was awarded on September 23, 2005 and it expires on July 28, 2010. It was established to fulfill the online site support requirement for the period in which it was designated; however, multiple changes to the Federal hiring process have prompted the USAJOBS Program to thoroughly re-evaluate how it defines this requirement.  In addition, it is essential to ensure the new solution maximizes the latest and most efficient technologies and processes available in this market. These issues need to be given careful consideration and will require more time for defining the agencies needs.  Therefore, to assure continuity of service in the meantime, an interim follow-on contract with a one-year base period plus six-month option period (broken down into monthly intervals) is requested. 

This solicitation will be presented to the incumbent documenting the requirement in its current state and the contractor will be given 14 calendar days to submit a written technical and price proposal (separately) for the base period and the option period referenced above.  The anticipated award date of this contract is on or about May 1, 2010.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by this agency.

This requirement is subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1988 (P.L.105-220).  The USAJOBS system will follow all relevant security standards approved for use in Federal Government systems and adopted by OPM. The security and privacy plan will follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-18, "Guide for Developing Security Plans for Information Technology Systems."  In addition, the initiative will follow other relevant NIST guidelines, such as Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) publication 197, regarding encryption standards.  The initiative will employ appropriate security technology to protect all sensitive information during storage, processing, and transmission across the network.  This technology will include firewalls, encryption, authentication mechanisms, and anti-virus software.

This requirement is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Commercial Items. The authority for this award is FAR 13.106-1 (b) (1)  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  

All parties interested in this procurement must submit a capability statement within 14 calendar days from the date of this notice.  Submissions after that date will not be considered.  Interested parties wishing to submit their questions, interest, and capabilities must do so in writing via email. Oral and facsimile requests for information will not be considered. Verification of receipt of electronic transmission is the sole responsibility of the contractor. A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is at the sole discretion of the Government. Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is required prior to execution of award. A detailed capability statement must be submitted to patricia.broome@opm.gov 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), April 15, 2010.  
Only e-mailed requests for additional information will be accepted at patricia.broome@opm.gov through 12:00 PM, EST, April 15, 2010.   

Vendors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and not registered in the VETS-100 database at the time the requirement is to be awarded will not be considered.  Vendors may register with CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or (269) 961-5757, or by accessing www.ccr.gov.  Vendors may register with VETS-100 by accessing https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/.

BUY AMERICAN ACT/BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROGRAM				EXHIBIT B

1.	BUY AMERICAN ACT  CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS  (FAR 52.225-9)(MAY 2002)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- 
"Component" means any article, material, or supply incorporated directly into construction materials. 
"Construction material" means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material. 
"Cost of components" means-- 
(1)	For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation 
costs to the place of incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or 
(2)	For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of 
the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product. 
"Domestic construction material" means-- 
(1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; or 
(2) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if the cost of its components mined, 
produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which non-availability determinations have been made are treated as domestic. 
"Foreign construction material" means a construction material other than a domestic construction material. 
"United States" means the 50 States and the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other place subject to U.S. jurisdiction, but does not include leased bases. 
(b) Domestic preference. (1) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d) and the Balance of Payments Program by providing a preference for domestic construction material. The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause. 
(2) This requirement does not apply to the construction material or components listed by the Government as follows: _________________________________________________________________________________
[Contracting Officer to list applicable excepted materials or indicate "none"] 
(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause if the Government determines that-- 
(i)	The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. The cost of a particular 
domestic construction material subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent; 
(ii)	The application of the restriction of the Buy American Act to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or 
(iii)	The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in 
sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. 




										Exhibit B
										Page 2

 (c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American Act. (1)(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including-- 
	
(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials; 
(B) Unit of measure; 
(C) Quantity; 
(D) Price; 
(E) Time of delivery or availability; 
(F) Location of the construction project; 
(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and 
(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause. 
(i)	A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a 
completed price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause. 
(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and 
any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued). 
(ii)	Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain 
why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination. 
(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American Act applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American Act applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with the Buy American Act or Balance of Payments Program. 
(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers.

2.	NOTICE OF BUY AMERICAN ACT  CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (FAR 52.225-10) (MAY 2002)

(a) Definitions. "Construction material," "domestic construction material," and "foreign construction material," as used in this provision, are defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Buy American Act-Construction Materials" (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.225-9). 
(b) Requests for determinations of inapplicability. An offeror requesting a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American Act should submit the request to the Contracting Officer in time to allow a determination before submission of offers. The offeror shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 in the request. If an offeror has not requested a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American Act before submitting its offer, or has not received a response to a previous request, the offeror shall include the information and supporting data in the offer. 
(c) Evaluation of offers. (1) The Government will evaluate an offer requesting exception to the requirements of the Buy American Act, based on claimed unreasonable cost of domestic 
construction material, by adding to the offered price the appropriate percentage of the cost of such foreign construction material, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9. 


										EXHIBIT B
										Page 3

(2) If evaluation results in a tie between an offeror that requested the substitution of foreign construction material based on unreasonable cost and an offeror that did not request an exception, the Contracting Officer will award to the offeror that did not request an exception based on unreasonable cost. 
(d) Alternate offers. (1) When an offer includes foreign construction material not listed by the Government in this solicitation in paragraph (b)(2) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9, the offeror also may submit an alternate offer based on use of equivalent domestic construction material. 
(2) If an alternate offer is submitted, the offeror shall submit a separate Standard Form 1442 for the alternate offer, and a separate price comparison table prepared in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 for the offer that is based on the use of any foreign construction material for which the Government has not yet determined an exception applies. 
(3) If the Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 does not apply, the Government will evaluate only those offers based on use of the equivalent domestic construction material, and the offeror shall be required to furnish such domestic construction material. An offer based on use of the foreign construction material for which an exception was requested-- 
(i) Will be rejected as non-responsive if this acquisition is conducted by sealed bidding; or 
(ii) May be accepted if revised during negotiations.

                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS


1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
a wage
   determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries
of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour Regional Office
for the area in
which the survey was conducted because those Regional Offices
have
responsibility for the Davis-Bacon survey program. If the
response from this
initial contact is not satisfactory, then the process described
in 2.) and
3.) should be followed. 

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process
described here, initial contact should be with the Branch of
Construction
Wage Determinations.  Write to: 

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party
(those affected by the action) can request review and
reconsideration from
the Wage and Hour Administrator (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR
Part 7).
Write to: 
                                                                                                                 EXHIBIT C
                                                                                                                  Page 5

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested
party's position and by any information (wage payment data,
project
description, area practice material, etc.) that the requestor
considers
relevant to the issue. 

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested
party may appeal directly to  the Administrative Review Board
(formerly the
Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

<DESC>OMBUDSMAN-NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTEST
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contract the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606<br />Washington, D.C. 20593<br />Telephone (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 372-3949</p>

This acquisition is unrestricted for offers' business size 1500 employees. The NAICS is 481212. The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation to be issued. Proposals are being requested as a written solicitation will not be issued. Purchase order to be awarded shall be under the authority of FAR part 12 "Acquisitions of Commercial Items". The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE: The NDS Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter. There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season. Typical transportation of propane to these sites will include the use of a barge and/or helicopter. The full "pickle" barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the remote site by a helicopter rated for that load. A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane from the 125 Gal. "Pickle" barrels to standard 500 Gallon propane tanks. This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity. Offeror must have experience with this type of task due to high risks associated with it.</p>
<p>FUEL REQUIREMENT: Fuel Requirement: Contractor shall fuel remote site with propane quantities and delivery date per Attachment 1 requirement. All tanks are to be filled to maximum capacity. Government estimate for fuel amounts should be +/- 10 % for each site, due to the accuracy of the gauges. Contractor shall be prepared to account for this variation by carrying up to 10 % more fuel than fixed requirement calls for to handle this contingency. Contractor shall perform propane leak checks (soap spray or sniffer) on all propane tanks and fuel lines at NDS remote sites, up to the location where fuel line enters generator hut. Leaks found during these inspections shall be isolated and repaired. In the event of an irreparable leak requiring additional cost to repair, notify the Contracting Officer immediately for action to be taken. The Contractor shall record actual gallons of propane delivered to each site on the invoice and tank gauge level percentages before and after filling. All documentation will be delivered to Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.</p>

****************************************************************************<br />Questions and Answers Modification #1<br /><br />(Q) Can you state what the cables and wiring would be used for?&nbsp;<br />(A) The cables and adapters will be used to interconnect microwave equipment operating between 1.7-8.5GHz<br /><br />(Q) &nbsp;Please clarify which male connector is called out on the three items below:<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 24"<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 36"<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 48"<br /><br />(A) All will be SMA Male to SMA Male RG-142 in 24, 36, 48 inches<br /><br />(Q) No RF specifications are called out. Parts such as N and SMA connectors come in several grades. &nbsp;One is a low grade good to a few GHz, then comes the standard grade good to 12 GHz, and then there is the high precision grade good to 18GHz. &nbsp;There is a big price difference between them. Based on the cables called out you are interested in the "standard" grade, but there are lots of vendors that will quote the lower grade. &nbsp;The same goes for the SMA 90 Degree, there is a sharp version good to 6GHz and then the radius bend good to 18 GHz<br /><br />(A) The FBI is seeking RF connectors and adapters in the standard grade, good to 12Ghz brass construction. &nbsp;As for the 90 degree SMA adapters, the FBI will accept the sharp turn type.<br /><br />(Q) &nbsp;The enduser might want to consider using RG400 instead of RG-142, the electrical specifications are the same. &nbsp;The difference is that RG400 has a stranded center conductor while RG-142 has a single silver plated steel center conductor. &nbsp;The benefit is increased flexibility.<br /><br />(A) The FBI is satisfied with the RG-142 type cable. &nbsp;The extra flexibility RG-400 gives is not critical nor significant.<br /><br />(Q) We don't think any vendor can supply all of these parts in 30 days. More realistic would be 1/2 in 30 days and all in 60 days.<br /><br />(A) &nbsp;The delivery time will be 60 days ARO (after receipt of order) with partial shipments accepted.<br />&nbsp;<br />Modification #2**************************************************<br />Please note that all&nbsp;lengths are 12, 24, 36 and 48 inches as noted.

Government Response to contractors question

1. After reading and rereading the SOW it remains unclear to me the DOJ preferred method d of pricing. Is the DOJ looking for and hourly rate per task or a flat rate per task or some other method?

Response: We are looking for a fixed per drop cost, inclusive of labor for the majority of our projects.  We also have to have a mechanism to have hourly labor rate to address certain situations wherein additional labor may be necessary due to a construction or an emergency situation which is beyond the Governments control.


2. No where in the SOW or in the accompanying Excel spread sheet are the number of network drops per office defined. Is that information available?

Response: At minimum, each office will have two (2) data drops.  Specific requirements are identified by local USAO personnel and submitted to EOUSA after the project is approved.  


3. This is a very large requirement for a small business will DOJ consider dividing the requirement into geographical regions?


Response: The Program Management team must be based in Washington, DC.  EOUSA is interested in options available to address the nationwide cable project requirement.


4. Will the DOJ consider holding a pre-bid conference?

Response: EOUSA intends on conducting on-site, oral presentations for contractor proposals.


5. What division of BAE currently services the contract?

<CONTACT>Moe FILALI, Purchasing Agent, Phone 2023724071, Fax 202-372-4905, Email Mohamed.Filali@USCG.Mil
<DESC><br />DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Coast Guard intends to purchase "Open Secret Space Cabling" project/services for the Coast Guard. This Open Secret Space SIPRNET Infrastructure project should include 50 Quad STP Data Jacks and 3 Quad Fiber Optic Data Jacks as per attached schedule under Statement of Work. <br /><br />This distance is approximately 250 feet. All other drops will be shorter as we proceed closer to the main distribution room. The layout of the drops can only be determined once ceiling tiles are opened and location decisions made after surveying best routing of data cables. The CG is flexible with determining final locations of all data drops.<br /><br />Additional Notes: <br />- No PDS is needed, but a cable tray support system is required<br />- No unclassified cabling will be installed per this SOW. It is possible the handling of some unclassified cabling will be required during installation of cable tray and/or STP/Fiber cables.<br />- It is possible for the crossing of JWICS, SIPRNET and NIPRNET cables to occur at differenct areas of project. So long as the TEMPEST requirements are met and adhered to this will not be an issue.<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Quad fiber optic WAO will need a dual gang box and face plate. <br />- The 3 quads fiber WAO, and the CAT6 STP will be of the same classification and can be installed in the same cable tray.<br />- The SMDR does not currently have the proper plywood backing for mounting hardware.<br />The plywood need to be 3/4inch thick fire rated plywood painted. These requirements will have to be met as they are all part of the FIPS EIA/TIA standards.<br />-Approxitmately, 30-50 STP/Fiber cables will need to be demo'ed after new installation is in place and cutover has occurred.<br />-Fiber WAO's will be terminated on double gang for each quad fiber optic cable. STP WAO's will be terminated with 4 CAT 6 STP cables on a single gang face plate.<br />- Secret clearance is required<br />- We would expect the contractor to install the labeled patch cables both fiber and copper. This will be a coordinated effort between the contractor and the customer during cutover period. <br />- - The fiber cable will be for MMF 62.5/125 and terminated with ST connectors. The CAT6 will be for a GIG network.<br />- All fiber connectors will be of the ST type.<br />- Fiber patch cables will need to be ST or ST: the fiber patch panels will need to interface ST to ST<br /><br />
<p>The total count for the copper STP CAT6 cables is 200 (50 WAO X 4 cables each = 200)</p>
<p>On the fiber count we need a total of 12 strands (3 WAO X 4 strands each = 12)</p>
<p>This is a correction to what the SOW indicates. On the SOW it specifies 24 strands of fiber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>PROPOSAL DUE DATE 12 APR 10<br /><br />SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE:&nbsp;4 March 2010. The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a cost plus award fee, non-personal services contract under full and open competition for Joint Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Management and Planning System (JSMPS)/Joint Integrated SATCOM Tool (JIST) Support. This is a follow-on contract to FA4600-05-F-0212. Performance will be for a five-year period. This will include a base period and four one-year option periods.</p>
<p>Services required within the scope of this requirement include technical support; hardware and software installation and integration; database and software development; continued development and deployment of existing JSMPS/JIST tools and capabilities; continued updating and employment of key SATCOM management and planning data; data manipulation and presentation; testing, demonstration, and fielding of developed software systems; and requisite hardware and software sustainment and support activities. JSMPS/JIST will be matured into a fully net-centric, web-enabled database and application suite with a hardware, software, and support architecture to meet the needs of DoD SATCOM stakeholders. The resulting tools and capabilities will provide a robust and secure environment for collaborative Electro-magnetic and Radio Frequency Interference (EMI/RFI) detection, tracking, analysis and mitigation. To accomplish this, JSMPS/JIST would expand existing capabilities encompassing assignment and execution data for all remaining DOD SATCOM systems, acquire needed data from existing and programmed SATCOM system management and planning applications and databases, and make this data readily available as an integrated and user-defined operational picture. To support better Intelligence Community (IC) participation in EMI resolution, JSMPS would be deployed on the JWICS network enclave with a cross-domain solution allowing for near-real time data refreshing from the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) JSMPS/JIST. JSMPS will connect to existing databases to provide data and products for Telemetry Tracking &amp; Control (TT&amp;C) data for all space systems to effectively support EMI resolution. Finally, JSMPS/JIST shall be available and sustainable while data is appropriately protected and secure.</p>
<p>On-site work may be performed at either of the following Government installations:</p>
<p>USSTRATCOM<br />Building 500<br />Offutt AFB, NE 68113-6600</p>
<p>AFSPC <br />Buildings 1470 &amp; 1471 <br />Peterson AFB, CO 80914-3050</p>
<p>All contractor personnel working any direct tasking on the project shall hold a minimum current SECRET security clearance (an interim SECRET clearance is acceptable for newly assigned personnel whose final clearance is still being completed). To work on-site within USSTRATCOM/J661 or within the GSSC, contractor personnel shall have a minimum TOP SECRET clearance and be eligible for Special Compartmented Information (SCI) indoctrination.</p>
<p>The RFP and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government-wide point of entry. No solicitation is available at this time. Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizops.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner. All associated documents will be released electronically. The NAICS code is 541512. Anticipated award date is Fall 2010.</p>
<p>Address questions via email to the contract specialist or contracting officer only. No discussions will be conducted telephonically.</p>

<CONTACT>Jerrod T Whittington, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 226-1940, Email jwhittin@aoc.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The Architect of the Capitol is the creator and caretaker of the US Capitol complex and for more than 200 years has applied ingenuity and craftsmanship to serve Congress, preserve history, and sustain the home of American democracy.     The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible to the United States Congress for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the Capitol, Congressional office buildings, Capitol Visitor Center, the Library of Congress buildings, the Supreme Court building, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Power Plant, and other facilities.  AOC.gov is comprised of approximately 600 pages and serves as the public face of the Agency for more than 3 million visitors to the site each year. Approximately 70% of the visitors are from the United States and 30% are from sites around the world.   AOC.gov is also the top site within Google for high profile searches such as &ldquo;Capitol&rdquo; and &ldquo;US Capitol.&rdquo;   SYNOPSIS:  The AOC anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for redesign of AOC.gov.  This RFP will be issued in electronic format only and will be available on or about 1 April 2010 on Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov). Please be advised the 1 April 2010 date for solicitation posting is estimated and the actual posting date may be after the estimated date. Please address any questions to Jerrod Whittington, Contract Specialist, via email at jwhittin@aoc.gov. Telephone inquires will not be acknowledged or accepted.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This project seeks to transcend the typical, and reinvent AOC.gov, with an award-winning design, to become as visually stunning and as memorable as an in-person visit to the U.S. Capitol. This project will enhance the design of AOC.gov to be reflective of the stature and symbolism of the buildings of the Capitol and surrounding campus. The project will enhance the visitor experience for the wide-range of audiences accessing the site.  Following an analysis and recommendation for design based on site metrics, audience profiles, and client goals, the selected vendor will develop web design templates for AOC.gov based on AOC brand standards that can be applied to the existing AOC.gov web content management system (PaperThin CommonSpot v.5).

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a competitive small business set-aside procurement for advisory and assistance services to Evaluate the Impact of Incentives Demonstrations on Participation in the Summer Food Service Program. USDA is committed to ending childhood hunger by 2015. A key challenge in meeting this commitment is the problem that food insecurity increases over the summer months, a period when school lunches and breakfasts are unavailable to most children. USDA's Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) was developed to "fill the gap" and provide meals to needy children during the months when school is not in session. However, peak SFSP participation has rarely exceeded 10-15 percent of average participation in free and reduced-price school lunches.<br />FNS seeks a qualified contractor to gather administrative data that can help FNS determine whether meaningful increases in participation (coverage) occur if (i) summer feeding providers are given financial incentives to increase their number of operating days or (ii) funds are made available for educational and recreational activities and programs that engage children and give them incentives to keep coming back.<br />For Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 and for as many of the fiscal years from 2006 to 2009 as feasible, collect specified administrative information from all demonstration States and up to 4 comparison States to be selected by FNS; organize the information into a statistical database (SAS or SPSS). Most information items are reported by States to FNS on forms FNS-418, FNS-143, and FNS-269. Some of the administrative data to be compiled is on file at the State level and the remainder of the administrative data is on file at the SFSP Sponsor level.

There is an option to utilize demountable wall panels in lieu of traditional construction techniques.  The remodel includes removal of the existing restrooms and installation of a new restroom facility.  There is also a renovation of the locker rooms and shower areas.  The existing Plumbing system will be completely removed and replaced to include a new service entrance.  The existing HVAC system is a Ground Source Heat Pump System which will be reutilized.  The individual heat pumps will be removed, salvaged, and reinstalled in the new office configuration.  The electrical systems will be completely demolished and new provided.  The existing lights shall be removed, modified, and re-installed in the new office configuration.  The electrical systems included shall be the power, lighting, fire alarm, mass notification, communications, and security systems.  Exterior work includes removal of all concrete pavement surrounding the facility to 82 feet from the building perimeter.
The following shall be awarded as a Single Firm Fixed Price Contract completely separate from the afore mentioned MILCON Project.  This 365 day project is estimated to be in the range of $500,000 to $1,000,000 contingent upon approved funding.  The SRM Project shall be PRQE072342 and PRQE082631:

<DESC>Recovery - This acquisition is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. Background: The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires Contractor support for its Health Information Technology (IT) Standards and Test Methods Project. The objective of the project is to focus resources on specific, national priority standards and testing needs in the healthcare community to further clinical information exchange among providers, consumers, public health and other stakeholders. This project does not seek to select the standards that should be used by the healthcare community; it seeks to analyze those standards deemed appropriate by the healthcare community by objectively determining the maturity, robustness, testability and suitability of a particular standard for use (i.e., is it free from ambiguities, errors, inconsistencies, omissions, and to the extent possible, meets intended requirements). Additionally, this project seeks to develop appropriate test material, data and standard-specific test tools for high priority national need standards and interoperability. Scope of this Acquisition: This presolicitation notice is for a noncommercial services acquisition in the area of test data set including test set definition, data content and associated documentation for Health Level (HL) 7 version 2 clinical laboratory test result message type. NIST intends to solicit this acquisition under the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (which are for acquisitions valued up to $100,000). The period of performance is anticipated to be less than one year. The Government intends to utilize the labor-hour contract type for these services because it is not possible for the Government to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. Presolicitation Conference: The Government will hold a presolicitation conference for this acquisition on Friday, March 5, 2010 at 9:30am Eastern Time.

Potential Offerors may call 1-877-932-2605 at 9:30am on March 5, 2010 and enter pass code 6301271 to participate in the presolicitation conference. Availability of Solicitation: NIST intends to post the solicitation on www.fbo.gov on or about 16 days after this notice is posted. Quotations will be due no later than 10 days after the solicitation is posted on www.fbo.gov. How to Obtain Solicitation and Amendments: Potential Offerors will be responsible for obtaining the solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solictiation; the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list. Any communications regarding the solicitation may only be submitted by email and should identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number. Requirement for Active Registration in CCR: Each Offeror must have an active registration at www.ccr.gov to be eligible to receive an award under this acquisition.

This notice is amended to: 1. Indicate that this acquisition will be conducted as a Total Small Business Set Aside using NAICS 541690 (size standard: $7.0 million); 2. Change the primary point of contact to Ms. Paula Ireland, Contractor Supprot, at paula.ireland@nist.gov; and 3. Indicate that all questions regarding this acquisition shall be directed by email to both the primary point of contact (paula.ireland@nist.gov) and the secondary point of contact (joseph.widdup@nist.gov). END OF TEXT

The purpose of this amendment is to correct the time for the presolicitation conference. The presolicitation conference will be held at 9:00am on Friday, March 5, 2010 (not 9:30am). END OF TEXT

The purposes of this amendment are (1) to extend the response date (due date for quotations) to April 2, 2010 at no later than 2:00pm Eastern Time and (2) to change the primary point of contact to Mr. Frank Yonce at frank.yonce@nist.gov. The solicitation will be posted on Friday, March 19, 2010. END OF TEXT

<DESC><p>CANCELLATION NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT<br /><br />&nbsp;This was a sources sought announcement and due to the high volume of interest this will be re advertised under RFQ # EM133F10RQ0475 that will be posted&nbsp; on or&nbsp;about April 12, 2010.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), located in Gloucester, MA., intends to issue a fixed price purchase order for the design, testing and delivering of commercial fishing line radio frequency ( RFID)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>tags.Fishing gear marking, a component of the ALWTRP,( Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan) is required for gear identification purposes if gear is recovered from an entangled animal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gear marking techniques are useful in determining, for example, if the gear was fished legally, the types of fisheries involved in entangling whales, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The goal of this project is to develop a type of tag that could be successfully deployed on fishing lines to help gather information on the origin and type of fishing gear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Understanding gear origin and type of gear can help guide management decisions and assist in disentanglement efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This " smart" tag must 1) be capable of being manufactured in multiple fluorescent colors, 2) contain a readable bar code utilizing a portable reading system, 3) be capable of sticking to both wet and dry line, and 4) be easily attached with a durability of at least one year of commercial fishing at sea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additional necessary characteristics of the tag include easy storage onboard vessels, low cost to purchase, and high visibility while hauling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It must contain bar code information that includes the type of gear, part of the gear it is attached to (e.g., buoy line, groundline), and origin of gear (state and owner). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The intent is that several RFID tags would be placed along the line between the surface system and gear on the ocean floor and also on lines between traps on the ocean floor. Lines have a range of between 5/16" to &frac34;" in diameter. Lines are often set in depths of up to 250 fathoms. Lines are at sea for several years so tags would need periodic replacement with a target of at least one year of operation<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The lines are used repeatedly over several years, but the tags would function a full year before replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to be submerged most of the year, the tag receives considerable abuse several times per week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tags are tossed around in both placement and retrieval.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On retrieval the line is wrapped a rotating V-pulley such that the bottom of the "V" has no width.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the line is wrapped, it is trapped in the "V" and pulled in with tensions in excess of 3000 lbs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is possible that the tag would be trapped in some way between the line and the V-pulley side applying great pressure on the IC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the tags extend out from the line like a flag<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>there is the potential they would be permanently crimped. The lines are run over a rotating type block and through a hauler where tensions could exceed 3000 lbs and crimping of the tag is very likely<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Introduction</strong><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Management of marine mammal populations falls within the jurisdiction of NOAA Fisheries' National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 and, for some species, under the Endangered Species Act (</span><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">ESA</span><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">) of 1973.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Section 118 of the MMPA directs NMFS to establish Take Reduction Teams (TRTs) to assist in the development of draft take reduction plans (TRPs) for strategic stocks of marine mammals that interact with a category I or II fishery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The long term goal of the take reduction planning process is reduce the mortality and serious injury of marine mammals to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate goal while taking into account the economics of the fishery, the availability of existing technology, and existing state or regional fishery management plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Presently the NMFS Northeast Regional Office (NERO) has three active take reduction teams working to address the incidental serious injury and mortality of marine mammals associated with various commercial fishing activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (ALWTRT) was established to address serious injury and mortality of right, humpback, fin and minke whales in the several fixed-geared fisheries including the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic lobster trap/pot fishery, the Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery, and the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the 2003 ALWTRT meeting, members agreed by consensus on two overarching principles for the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP): 1) reduce entanglement risks associated with groundlines (the lines that connect multiple traps/pots to each other in a trawl or, for gillnet gear, lines that connect an anchor or buoy line to a gillnet or gillnet bridle); and 2) reduce entanglement risks associated with vertical lines (buoy lines associated with trap/pot or gillnet gear).<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong>To address the entanglement risks associated with groundlines, NMFS, with input from the ALWTRT, has implemented a broad-based gear modification strategy that requires, amongst other measures, sinking groundline for trap/pot and gillnet gear (72 FR 57104, October 5, 2007; 73 FR 51228; September 2, 2008).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sinking groundlines reduce entanglement risk to large whales by sinking to the ocean bottom rather than arcing up into the water column.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A continuing concern in the evolution of the ALWTRP is the risk of entanglement in vertical line. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;Regarding entanglement risks with vertical lines, to better understand the vertical line entanglement risks, and potential biological and socioeconomic impacts of additional management measures intended to address them, NMFS is seeking additional information that can be ascertained from entanglements between commercial fishing gear and large whales.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At present, NMFS lacks very important gear characterization information that can be essential to management initiatives to further conserve large whale species.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>To achieve this information needed by NMFS, NMFS is seeking to explore a new technology to mark vertical lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The new technology is called Radio Frequency Identification (RFID).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The goal of this study is to develop a RFID tag, in consultation with the NMFS PRD Gear Research Team, which would be able to identify source of line recovered from entangled marine mammals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Line tagging concepts that have been experimented with, but not completed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Injectable RFID - these units have been worked into the braids of the line and held in place by silicon caulk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This suffers from being very time consuming and spreads the braids of the line</li>
<li>A long narrow dipole is captured in smaller braided twine and then the twine is braided into the fishing line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This potentially increases the likelihood the IC will be crushed as well as the IC will be separated from the antenna by experiencing the tension and subsequent elongation of the fishing line.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>. Ideally tags would be able to stick to wet or dry line to accommodate line already in service.</p>
<p>The intent is to read the tags with a handheld reader, so 1-2 ft range is acceptable with a handheld reader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Presently the quest to just be able to determine type of fisheries, location gear was originally set, where in the gear (buoy line or ground line) and owner of gear<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test Protocols</span>:</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: none; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo4; ">Submersion Test - submerge so-called waterproof tags in a near ocean salinity water solution and test for RF function and observe for wick once a week for 13 wks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any tag that fails because of water migration fails that waterproofing approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Use 25 of each design approach.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">Abuse Test - pull fishing line with inlays attached under tension with a V-pulley using difference inlay design and orientations seeing if any naturally avoid V-pulley abuse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Run 25 of each design approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simulate 100 "haul-ins".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read the inlay to identify damaged tags and plot the loss for each inlay attachment execution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Final Test- Build 25 of the proposed tape/inlay tags and attach to fishing line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Submerge in a similar salt water bath and pull through the V pulley once a day under tension for 3 weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Record and analyze any RFID read failures or permanent tag deformation.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management has awarded the subject award to Premier Data Services.  Blanket Purchase Agreement L10PA00578 was utilized to award this requirement.  Below is a description of the requirement.
Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, the Nevada BLM has been tasked with ensuring accuracy of the attributes of digital land records.  The geographic location of the identified renewable energy townships is primarily in areas having the potential for renewable energy in support of the current administrations energy priorities and in the transmission of that energy.  This project will inventory, validate and verify BLM public land records by comparing the automated LR2000 data against the manual public records for approximately 1,700 townships in the State of Nevada.
The vendor will validate all pending and authorized renewable energy cases. Compare case legal land descriptions against the manual public land records (Master Title Plats, Use Plats, Historical Index and Controlled Document Index, case file) to assure data contained in LR2000 accurately and precisely reflect the official records in accordance with standards. In addition, assure all locations can map in GIS and identify any cases that are not on public domain open to renewable energy development.  Validate existing public land records and LR2000 data that impact renewable energy development. Ensure that all title and use cases are accurately noted on the manual records and the corresponding LR2000 cases are validated.  Validate the reserved federal subsurface mineral ownership on split estate lands this will include approximately 1,700 townships.  Develop township plots that spatially display cases that have been validated. This will allow for a visual inspection of validated data and will confirm the cases ability to map properly.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management has awarded the subject requirement against blanket purchase agreement L10PA00578.  Below is a description of that requirement.
This task will involve collecting geographic coordinates on approximately 340 PLSS corners of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) across 130 ARRA townships.  The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey, title, and legal land description information to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and title information in support of parcel based display of geographic information.  The Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) is the digital portrayal of the PLSS and is assembled in a series of working ascii files and a geo-database for publication.  This task order is to improve the accuracy of the depiction of the PLSS within GCDB.
Remonumentation of government corner positions is not allowed under this award.  Monuments shall be described as found and not rehabilitated.  The contractor will not use accessories to establish a corner position, but accessories may be used to verify that a monument is in the position of record.

<DESC>DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS
<p>Recovery Act-Funded Contract Action</p>
<p>Identification of OPDIV/Contracting Activity: OAGM/AGG/DRCG<br />Project Officer: Negussie Tilahun, ORDI<br />Title: Long-Term Care - Assessment File<br />Contract Type: Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee<br />Contractors: Expedited Research and Demonstration (XRAD) Task Order Contractors (SB)<br /><br /><br />Findings:<br />I. Authority</p>
<p>This task order is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, (Recovery Act, P.L. 111-5) which specifies, "To the maximum extent practicable, contracts funded under this Act shall be awarded as fixed-price contracts through the use of competitive procedures." <br />II. This contract action is competitive.<br />__X__ Yes<br />_____ Not Available for Competition. This action is statutorily exempt from competition, e.g., noncompetitive 8(a) set-aside, Tribal agreements (for IHS only), mandatory source.<br />_____ No As appropriate, please attach a copy of (1) the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC); (2) the Limited Source Justification (LSJ); (3) documentation of Exception to the Fair Opportunity Process (under FAR 16.505(b)(5)); or (4) for simplified acquisitions, a brief description of the circumstances which justify not competing, signed by the contracting officer. <br />III. This contract action is fixed price. <br />_____ Yes<br />___X_ No <br />Purpose<br />This Medicaid Analytic eXtract file (MAX) comparative effectiveness research (CER) task order funded per the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 will develop a research file that incorporates key administrative assessment data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) for nursing facilities, data from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for home health agencies, and selected On-line Survey and Certification Assessment Reporting (OSCAR) data and link it to Medicare and Medicaid administrative data. This file will be known as the Long-Term Care Assessment file (LTC-A). A wide range of beneficiary and provider information will be linked with the MAX system of files and the Medicare Base Summary Files (BASF) from the CMS Chronic Condition Warehouse. CMS believes that this effort will greatly enhance CER studies pertaining to long-term care and post-acute services. The LTC-A file will enable researchers to access more readily the wide range of information across programs that constitute data that may be of interest for conducting comparativeness research in the area of long term care. <br />MDS and OASIS assessment data provide basic information on beneficiary functional and health status as well as enabling CMS to monitor provider compliance and oversight regarding the case-mix and quality of long-term care services offered by nursing homes and home health agencies. OSCAR is used for reporting facility information and provides key provider-level information. The combined potential for use of this individual level information as linked to Medicaid and Medicare administrative data is anticipated to be useful to regulators, comparative effectiveness and other health care services researchers and providers in order to monitor the effectiveness of current delivery systems and improve quality of care and outcomes. <br />The LTC-A will allow the creation of valid and reliable information about the care givers, facilities, care provided and profile of beneficiaries over a long period of time- information that is fundamental for obtaining a more complete understanding of the relationship between Medicaid, Medicare and the provision of post-acute and institutional long-term care with implications for monitoring and improving the quality of care. <br />The project will include data for the years 1999-2011. Tasks include the development of a file design report and work plan, a pilot test of the LTC-A file using data for calendar year 2006, finalizing the LTC-A file, production of the file for all other years, conducting a sample research study task, and the submission of a final report.</p>
<p>Key Deliverables (subject to change):<br />&bull; Design Report and Work plan 90 Days after award<br />&bull; LTC-A Pilot 20 months after award<br />&bull; LTC-A Production Through 54 Months after award<br />&bull; LTC-A Feasibility Study 9/2013<br />&bull; Final Report 9/2013</p>
<p>Specificity/nature of requirement (risk and profit):<br />The MAX CER initiative will enhance and expand the experience that CMS has in building research data from States on Medicaid eligibility and claims information. This foundation must be continually enhanced in significant ways to make it more adaptive to the needs of researchers examining comparative effectiveness of health care procedures and services. The below described MAX/CER contract requirements illustrate the problem in developing accurate and comprehensive price information. In addition, problems with data accuracy and production efforts affect a determination of the realistic cost of capturing Medicaid data.</p>
<p>Long-Term Care - Assessment File</p>
<p>&bull; A very wide range of information will need to be considered for inclusion in this analytic file in combination with Medicare and Medicaid LTC assessment data from MDS and OASIS. The innovative and developmental aspects of the design requirements make this work incompatible with fixed price contracting goals with respect to achieving price efficiency.</p>
<p>&bull; A major challenge in this task will be to determine to what extent and with what frequency the data from the two assessment systems should be incorporated into a research file as is proposed. The design task in the contract is intended to determine the answer to this question. There are trade-offs for researchers both per inclusion and exclusion decisions. It will be important to involve technical experts as part of the design development;</p>
<p>&bull; Linkage of assessment data to Medicaid claims and eligibility data should be anticipated to be predictable to a certain extent with fully operationalized sets of processes to complete the linkage task. Nevertheless variation in data accuracy and quality across States and years will lead directly to variation in resources required by contractors to optimize the data for research use.</p>
<p>&bull; The development of an analytic file to enhance the capability of the file to serve CER requires a set of activities starting with concept development to prototype implementation. CMS will not be able to provide precise performance requirements for this task until a prototype system is developed, designed, revised as may be necessary, and then implemented for all States.</p>
<p>Monitoring and Cost Control<br />CMS has always utilized a significant degree of cost control over contracts that are not conducive to fixed pricing arrangements. This has been possible because of the vast knowledge and experience within the Office of Research Demonstrations and Information regarding Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP research programs. In addition, OAGM proposes to compete the acquisitions utilizing the XRAD (6 small business contractors) Task Order Contracts. This acquisition approach combines the knowledge and experience of CMS' technical program acumen and the vast experience of our contractor community with CMS programs and goals. This partnering relationship permits the most efficient use of CMS funds, promotes efficiencies and costs savings, and quickly facilitates the identification and resolution of problems. Although the above considerations are positive the very nature of research projects has demonstrated that projected results at the start of a project are subject to varying circumstances, most notably the enactment of new legislation and/or regulations that may govern the nature of the final requirement. In addition to the above concerns with determining a sound basis for developing a scope of work that would be conducive to fixed price contracting environment, the following price and technical issues also adversely affect that process:<br />Price<br />Although a fixed price contract is desirable in that the contractor assumes the risk for performance, the CMS must consider the potential financial and performance risk to the contractor under these highly visible ARRA programs.<br />A firm-fixed price contract is suitable when reasonable definitive functional or detailed specifications exist, and the contracting officer can establish fair and reasonable prices based on the following considerations:<br />&bull; there is adequate price competition<br />&bull; there are reasonable price comparisons under prior purchases of the same or similar services on a competitive basis supported by valid pricing data<br />&bull; available pricing information permits realistic estimates of probable cost, and<br />&bull; performance uncertainties can be identified and reasonable estimates of their cost impact can be made.</p>
<p>Technical Generic Issues Regarding State MSIS Reporting<br />&bull; Lack of timely MSIS submissions<br />&bull; Multiple failures of submitted MSIS data meeting minimum standards for quality<br />&bull; Missing service records<br />&bull; Miscoding of critical data elements<br />&bull; Changing "unique" MSIS personal identifiers<br />&bull; Unexpected and inconsistent changes in enrollment records eligibility groups<br />&bull; Unexpected and inconsistent changes in utilization by type of service, and <br />&bull; Incomplete reporting of encounter records for person in prepaid managed care plans</p>
<p>IV. If this contract action is not both fixed price and competitive, describe any additional steps taken to pursue a fixed priced competitive award (e.g., prepared more precise requirements documents; established more stringent review thresholds; expanded market research). If no additional steps were taken, please so state.<br />No additional steps were taken to pursue a fixed price award.&emsp;<br />V. Determination:<br />Based upon the findings, it is the determination of the government that Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract type enhances the degree of potential successful performance and promotes the potential of competition from the XRAD contractors that could not absorb the risk of a fixed-price contract type.</p>
<p>The HCA (or a GS-1102-15 or higher designee) certifies that a fixed price award is not appropriate (considering contract risk, profit, and specificity/nature of requirement).</p>

<DESC>DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS
<p>Recovery Act-Funded Contract Action</p>
<p>Identification of OPDIV/Contracting Activity: OAGM/AGG/DRCG<br />Project Officer: David Baugh, ORDI<br />Title: Environmental Scanning Activity<br />Contract Type: Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee<br />Contractors: Expedited Research and Demonstration (XRAD) Task Order Contractors (SB)</p>
<p>Findings:<br />I. Authority</p>
<p>This task order is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, (Recovery Act, P.L. 111-5) which specifies, "To the maximum extent practicable, contracts funded under this Act shall be awarded as fixed-price contracts through the use of competitive procedures." <br />II. This contract action is competitive.<br />__X__ Yes<br />_____ Not Available for Competition. This action is statutorily exempt from competition, e.g., noncompetitive 8(a) set-aside, Tribal agreements (for IHS only), mandatory source.<br />_____ No As appropriate, please attach a copy of (1) the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC); (2) the Limited Source Justification (LSJ); (3) documentation of Exception to the Fair Opportunity Process (under FAR 16.505(b)(5)); or (4) for simplified acquisitions, a brief description of the circumstances which justify not competing, signed by the contracting officer. <br />III. This contract action is fixed price. <br />_____ Yes<br />___X_ No <br />Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to define basic requirements for a Medicaid/CHIP Environmental Scanning and Program Characteristics (ESPC) database that will include an array of Medicaid program characteristics for each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The competitive task order will support comparative effectiveness research (CER) for Medicaid and Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrollees.</p>
<p>Title XIX and subsequent Federal legislation has permitted States many options in the design and the State administration of the Medicaid program. As a result, there are nearly infinite dimensions on which State Medicaid programs may differ, including the following Medicaid program characteristics:</p>
<p>&bull; Extending eligibility to a number of optional eligibility groups;<br />&bull; Providing full or restricted coverage for dual Medicare/Medicaid enrollees;<br />&bull; Providing coverage of an array of optional services;<br />&bull; Identifying service coverage limits;<br />&bull; Establishing prior authorization requirements;<br />&bull; Determining payment methods and levels;<br />&bull; Establishing mandatory managed care initiatives;<br />&bull; Implementing a wide variety of waivers to standard program requirements; and<br />&bull; Defining the covered prescription drug formulary.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of other "environmental scanning" factors that affect enrollment, utilization, and spending within individual State Medicaid programs. Data on these factors may be used in a number of ways. The ESPC information set of state-specific values will enable the use of contextual (or independent variables) which will enrich multivariate analyses combining Medicaid Analytic eXtract file (MAX) data and ESPC variables, as well as help researchers interpret research findings in the context of ESPC information.</p>
<p>In order to understand specific statistical findings, Medicaid trends within a State, or to compare experience across States it is usually necessary to consider the relative effects of many of these contextual factors on observed data. The ESPC will be a single source that captures data on many of these factors. It will represent a ready data set for CER that includes observations needed to support research and policy analysis in Medicaid and CHIP.</p>
<p>Key Deliverables (subject to change):<br />&bull; Base: Design Report and Work plan 90 Days after award<br />&bull; ESPC Pilot 12/2010<br />&bull; ESPC Production Through 4/2013<br />&bull; Option: Feasibility Study 9/2013<br />&bull; Final Report 9/2013</p>
<p>Specificity/nature of requirement (risk and profit):<br />The Medicaid Analytic eXtract file (MAX) comparative effective research (CER) initiative will enhance and expand the experience that CMS has in building research data from States on Medicaid eligibility and claims information. This foundation must be continually enhanced in significant ways to make it more adaptive to the needs of researchers examining comparative effectiveness of health care procedures and services. The below described MAX/CER contract requirements illustrate the problem in developing accurate and comprehensive price information. In addition, problems with data accuracy and production efforts affect a determination of the realistic cost of capturing Medicaid data.</p>
<p>Environmental Scanning Activity</p>
<p>&bull; The design for the Environmental Scan involves preparing a concept and then building the data file based on the approved concept. This is a completely new task/approach for which there is no precedent. A very wide range of information that might be useful to consider for inclusion in this file would need to be considered and then winnowed down for potential conclusion. Until the contents of this file are designed, collected, and prepared for use, it will be impossible to know sufficient information to fully understand the magnitude of the requirement.</p>
<p>&bull; Technological innovations in the design and implementation of this task cannot be determined in advance. CMS will want offerors to consider innovative IT solutions in their responses to the statement of work which is likely to generate a wide range of options for further CMS consideration.</p>
<p>&bull; Design of file: The parameters are not easily determined and must be flexible. Availability of information is subject to change, and, often, data may come from internal CMS sources and non-CMS sources beyond the control of the contractor.</p>
<p>&bull; Uniqueness of product: The work is a highly specialized set of information to be developed across a wide range of potential content domains pertaining to Medicaid and CHIP program characteristics as well as State economic and health care characteristics. The development of this file requires an unusual focus on the relationship of the information to be included and its relevance to research and policy development needs pertaining to CER.</p>
<p>&bull; Need for revised and updated files: Once an initial product is delivered, it will be necessary to adapt for future program updates and continuous changes in Federal and State laws and regulations. Such changes cannot be anticipated in advance.</p>
<p>&bull; Reliance on external sources for information: The contractor will need to rely on State government personnel as sources for much key information about current or past program information. To the extent that State staff turnover leads to the loss of institutional memory, many details relevant to the environmental scan activity may be increasingly difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>&bull; Again, the open and less certain aspects of the "Environmental Scanning Activity" create an uncertain contracting environment.<br />Monitoring and Cost Control<br />CMS has always utilized a significant degree of cost control over contracts that are not conducive to fixed pricing arrangements. This has been possible because of the vast knowledge and experience within the Office of Research Demonstrations and Information regarding Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP research programs. In addition, OAGM proposes to compete the acquisition utilizing the XRAD (6 small business contractors) Task Order Contracts. This acquisition approach combines the knowledge and experience of CMS' technical program acumen and the vast experience of our contractor community with CMS programs and goals. This partnering relationship permits the most efficient use of CMS funds, promotes efficiencies and costs savings, and quickly facilitates the identification and resolution of problems. Although the above considerations are positive, the very nature of research projects has demonstrated that projected results at the start of a project are subject to varying circumstances, most notably the enactment of new legislation and/or regulations that may govern the nature of the final requirement. In addition to the above concerns with determining a sound basis for developing a scope of work that would be conducive to fixed price contracting environment, the following price and technical issues also adversely affect that process:<br />Price<br />Although a fixed price contract is desirable in that the contractor assumes the risk for performance, the CMS must consider the potential financial and performance risk to the contractor under these highly visible ARRA programs.</p>
<p>Technical Generic that Adversely Impact State MSIS Reporting<br />&bull; Lack of timely MSIS submissions<br />&bull; Multiple failures of submitted MSIS data meeting minimum standards for quality<br />&bull; Missing service records<br />&bull; Miscoding of critical data elements<br />&bull; Changing "unique" MSIS personal identifiers<br />&bull; Unexpected and inconsistent changes in enrollment records eligibility groups<br />&bull; Unexpected and inconsistent changes in utilization by type of service, and <br />&bull; Incomplete reporting of encounter records for person in prepaid managed care plans</p>
<p>IV. If this contract action is not both fixed price and competitive, describe any additional steps taken to pursue a fixed priced competitive award (e.g., prepared more precise requirements documents; established more stringent review thresholds; expanded market research). If no additional steps were taken, please so state.<br />No additional steps were taken to pursue a fixed price award.&emsp;<br />V. Determination:<br />Based upon the findings, it is the determination of the government that Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract type enhances the degree of potential successful performance and promotes the potential of competition from the XRAD contractors that could not absorb the risk of a fixed-price contract type.<br />The HCA (or a GS-1102-15 or higher designee) certifies that a fixed price award is not appropriate (considering contract risk, profit, and specificity/nature of requirement).</p>

<DESC>DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS
<p>Recovery Act-Funded Contract Action</p>
<p>Identification of OPDIV/Contracting Activity: OAGM/AGG/DRCG<br />Project Officer: Susan Radke, ORDI<br />Title: Production and Enhancement Activity<br />Contract Type: Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee<br />Contractors: Medicare and Medicaid Research and Demonstration (MRAD) Task Order Contractors (LB/SB)</p>
<p>Findings:<br />I. Authority</p>
<p>This task order is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, (Recovery Act, P.L. 111-5) which specifies, "To the maximum extent practicable, contracts funded under this Act shall be awarded as fixed-price contracts through the use of competitive procedures." <br />II. This contract action is competitive.<br />__X__ Yes<br />_____ Not Available for Competition. This action is statutorily exempt from competition, e.g., noncompetitive 8(a) set-aside, Tribal agreements (for IHS only), mandatory source.<br />_____ No As appropriate, please attach a copy of (1) the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC); (2) the Limited Source Justification (LSJ); (3) documentation of Exception to the Fair Opportunity Process (under FAR 16.505(b)(5)); or (4) for simplified acquisitions, a brief description of the circumstances which justify not competing, signed by the contracting officer. <br />III. This contract action is fixed price. <br />_____ Yes<br />___X_ No <br />Purpose<br />This task order is to produce person level data files on Medicaid eligibility, service utilization and payment information to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) that is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). As a component of the ARRA, CMS has been approved by the Department of Health and Human Services to produce and enhance the Medicaid Analytic eXtract file (MAX). <br />The MAX Production, Enhancement and Data Quality is offered as a competitive contract with a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.. The base includes tasks relating to the production of MAX along with the development of an accelerated version of MAX to produce more timely data for research use. Options include a range of activities including: Verification of SSNs, production of a master file of Medicaid/CHIP enrollment, linkage to Federal surveys, the development of provider characteristics, technical assistance to States for Medicaid encounter data, and technical assistance to States for CHIP encounter data.<br />This contract will allow the continuation of transforming Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) data into (MAX) data which merges Medicaid demographic and claims information as well as converts fiscal year quarters into a calendar year. The purpose of MAX is to organize Medicaid data and make it usable for researchers to support research and policy analysis on Medicaid populations. <br />In addition to producing MAX data, the contractor will also design, develop, and establish an early release version of MAX data named Beta MAX so that researchers may obtain Medicaid data more timely for CER. This contract also provides an option to continue major activities that enhance MAX data for comparative effectiveness research activities. <br />All tasks in the base contract as well as the optional tasks will build and expand the Medicaid Data infrastructure to provide quality data sets and a variety of data sources needed for CER.<br />Optional tasks may be awarded at any time during the period of performance.</p>
<p>Key Deliverables (subject to change):<br />&bull; Base: Design Report and Work plan 90 Days after award<br />&bull; MAX Production and Beta-MAX 2009 Data 12/2011<br />&bull; Base: Final Report 9/1/2013<br />&bull; Options V-X:<br />o Design reports 60 Days after award<br />o Specific Products 9/2010-9/2013<br />&bull; Options Final Reports 9/2013</p>
<p>Specificity/nature of requirement (risk and profit):<br />The MAX CER initiative will enhance and expand the experience that CMS has in building research data from States on Medicaid eligibility and claims information. This foundation must be continually enhanced in significant ways to make it more adaptive to the needs of researchers examining comparative effectiveness of health care procedures and services. The below described MAX/CER contract requirements illustrate the problem in developing accurate and comprehensive price information. In addition, problems with data accuracy and production efforts affect a determination of the realistic cost of capturing Medicaid data.<br />1) Production and Enhancement Activity</p>
<p>&bull; The inherent nature of all the work to be performed involves improving the production and the development of enhancements to an evolving system of Medicaid data which, by definition, are prototypical and non-standard, and, therefore not naturally predisposed to being priced with accuracy in advance.</p>
<p>&bull; The work to be performed is to occur at a time in which there is a potential for significant Medicaid program changes to existing CHIP mandates and potential health care reform legislation. These evolving requirements will make it impossible to design a statement of work with the level of certainty that would be conducive to fixed pricing without creating a contract environment that would require constant change orders as the nature of the requirement is solidified.</p>
<p>&bull; Even if the "production" activity were to be considered as potentially possible under fixed price, the necessary enhancements could not be produced without having on uncertain impact on the core production tasks in the contract.</p>
<p>&bull; The open and less certain aspects of the "Production and Enhancement Activity", in addition to the absence of a defined performance base may lead to proposals that reflect higher prices to protect against the risk of unsuccessful performance.<br />Monitoring and Cost Control<br />CMS has always utilized a significant degree of cost control over contracts that are not conducive to fixed pricing arrangements. This has been possible because of the vast knowledge and experience within the Office of Research Demonstrations and Information regarding Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP research programs. In addition, OAGM proposes to compete the acquisition utilizing the MRAD (15 long time CMS contractors) Task Order Contracts. This acquisition approach combines the knowledge and experience of CMS' technical program acumen and the vast experience of our contractor community with CMS programs and goals. This partnering relationship permits the most efficient use of CMS funds, promotes efficiencies and costs savings, and quickly facilitates the identification and resolution of problems.

<p>IV. If this contract action is not both fixed price and competitive, describe any additional steps taken to pursue a fixed priced competitive award (e.g., prepared more precise requirements documents; established more stringent review thresholds; expanded market research). If no additional steps were taken, please so state.<br />No additional steps were taken to pursue a fixed price award.&emsp;<br />V.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALFOR EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITYFAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii)Upon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.1.  Contracting Activity		Requiring ActivityDepartment of Veterans Affairs		Department of Veterans AffairsCenter for Acq. Innovation-Austin       VA Network and Security Center1615 Woodward Street			882 T J Jackson DriveAustin, TX 78772			Falling Waters, WV 254192.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  This justification and approval sets forth the facts and requests approval for the issuance of a follow-on contract task order in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii).  The proposed cost is estimated to be $10,854,433.20 for General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) to continue performance of critical congressionally mandated telecommunications modernization engineering and network services.  The period of performance begins 30 March 2010 and continues for a base period of six months with up to two (2) three-month options, and a possible transition period not to exceed 90 days thereafter.3.  Description of Service and Supplies: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been mandated to support the national telecommunications network while following approved Enterprise Architecture (EA) design and functionality.  As a result the Enterprise Wide Area Network (WAN) project was established to engineer and implement a national enterprise network for VA.  Critical to the success of this effort is maintaining the continuity of knowledge-based contractor support for the operation of the network.  The Enterprise WAN is responsible for establishing the new telecommunications infrastructure while:	Reducing security risks; 	Ensuring against impacts to patient care and loss of veteran    benefit information as data traverses the network; 	Establishing business standard network monitoring and budgeting tools; 	Continually assessing application deployments for impacts on capacity management.  The scope and purpose of the follow on contract is to provide  knowledge-based services, which include conducting telecommunications network engineering operations, providing capacity planning, and providing implementation support.  These activities include performance of the following tasks:	Provide state of the art Network and Security Engineering for the VA.  Design, deploy and operate the VAs internal network infrastructure based on fault tolerant MPLS clouds for the 300k seat network.  	Secure the network and the Internet Gateway infrastructure.  Operate redundant 7/24 NSOC centers that oversee the internal infrastructure.  Operates the 7/24 service desk for the approximately 25K users of the remote access solutions.	Server Management	Network Management Services	IT Security Operations Services	Storage Area Network Services	Continuity of Operations	Telecommunications Services	Design and Implementation Services	Enterprise Engineering and Implementation	Government Managed Services Support	Infrastructure Application Support	Common Enterprise Infrastructure	Customer Remote Access	Desktop Management Services	IT Security Administration Services	Asset Management4.  Statutory Authority:  This acquisition will be conducted under the authority of 41 USC 253j, and  FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii); logical follow-on exception to fair opportunity. The basis for logical follow-on is economy, efficiency and logical follow-on to an order already issued under fair opportunity.  The task order will be placed to maintain the engineering and operational integrity of, or to augment an established telecommunications capability within an organization. 5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: GDIT was selected for the previous task order using a competitive process under GSAs Government-wide Connections contract. This is not a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS).  GDIT was the only company to submit a proposal under the fair opportunity procedure. Additional time is needed to more carefully plan the approach for a five-year follow-on contract, and to consider use of a different contract vehicle if necessary, to promote and improve competition. The following factors: complexity and cost of this interim requirement;  the time needed for industry to respond, and; time for the VA to properly evaluate proposals, prevent us from competing this interim contract, without causing a break in service. A break would quickly and severely degrade VA operations across the enterprise. The authority applies because this action ensures the operational integrity of established telecommunications capabilities in VA.A new, competitive five-year contract for Network Engineering and Operations Support Services is currently in the pre-solicitation planning process. This action will provide adequate lead time to ensure competitive procedures can be used for the five-year follow-on contract.   The initial intent was to award the five-year follow-on contract in time to avoid a break in service. However, recent reorganization efforts and associated delays in obtaining reviews and approvals restricted timely submission of an actionable procurement, and it will not be possible to competitively award a five-year contract before expiration of the final six-month extension provision on the current order. The current orders extension provision permits performance to continue only through 29 Mar 2010. This order will be issued in accordance with the fair opportunity provisions of both FAR 16.505 and the GSA Connections contract.6.  Efforts to Solicit Potential Sources:  A new procurement package is being developed that will ensure the performance work statement is not restrictive and promotes competition.  Full and Open Competition will be sought for the new contract.  A Request for Information (RFI) notice is planned for the follow-on effort. There are no other actions that currently can be taken to make the immediate action available for competition without suffering a break in service.7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable.  The cost of this interim acquisition will be fair and reasonable.  Actions anticipated to ensure reasonableness of the price will be accomplished by using the pricing procedure detailed in the GSA Connections contract, Section A: Solicitation/Contract Form, paragraph B.1.1. Pricing of Orders, the price tables within it, and by using the policies and methods set forth in FAR Subparts 15.4 and 16.505(b).  We intend to issue a firm-fixed-price document, except for approximately 8% of the award value,  which will be used for Ad-Hoc gateway support; the nature and timing of these tasks will require pricing on a labor-hour basis (see accompanying Determination and Findings for Use of Labor Hour Contract in the contract file).  The cost estimate is based on use of existing GSA Connections contract prices, and by applying previously negotiated price discount assumptions.  8.  Other Supporting Data:  N/A9.  Other Interested Sources:  None currently identified, but market research efforts are expected to identify multiple sources capable for the follow-on effort to this action.10.  Future Competitive Plans:  Plans are underway to develop a solicitation for a full and open competitive contract to replace this interim contract.  This contract will provide for a transitional period (Continuity of Service clause) of up to ninety (90) days to ensure a smooth change-over, if the incumbent contractor is replaced.  VA is requesting this sole source contract for six months plus two three-month options which will afford the necessary time to issue and award a competitive solicitation for a consolidated engineering support contract.  GDITs performance has been excellent in meeting or exceeding all previous and current requirements. 11.	Future barriers to competition:  None.
