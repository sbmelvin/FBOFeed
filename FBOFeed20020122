<DESC>The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) intends to award a sole source procurement to Codonics, Inc., c/o C-Ray Imaging Products, Middleburg Heights, OH.  NIMA has a requirement for the purchase of two (2) NP 1660 Codonics Network Imaging System with three years warranty, 1600-PS Postscript Level II, and 1600-SU software updates. The NP-1660 Codonics printer is currently required since NIMA operations already owns four of this type of printer.  Procurement of the same printer will avoid additional costs related to supplies, integration, testing, and training.  Furthermore, such integration and testing would require time that is unacceptable to the government due to crisis support requirements.  The NIMA Rep. To the CIA Ops Center and the President's Imagery Team each have one of these printers. The same equipment must be maintained at both these sites in support of NIMA's statutory policy support mission.   Maintenance swapout will have to be accomplished within two hours to support mission requirements.  Furthermore, space at these areas is at an extreme premium and thus these additional printers must fit exactly in the same footprint as the existing printer.  The dimension of the printer is 12"H, 17"W, 21"L. This is a synopsis of intent to award a firm fixed price contract under FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items.  The authority for sole source procurement is FAR 6.302-1(a), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Responsible sources that are interested in this procurement may respond by providing clear and convincing information that identifies their ability to provide the printers.  All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, Attn:  Linda O., (301) 227-4793 by 2:00 P.M., EST, 31 January 2002.  It is the responsibility of the sender to confirm if facsimiles have been received.

<DESC>Engineering Services are required under an indefinite quantity contract for Naval Installations throughout the United States. These Services are required for preparation of Preliminary Range Assessments at Closed, Transferred and Transferring (CTT) Ranges owned by the U.S. Navy.  The objective of the Preliminary Range Assessment (PRA) is to determine if a CTT Range poses a threat to public health or the environment, to identify if the nature of such threat is from explosive hazard, constituent contamination, or both and to set priorities for further remedial investigation.   In addition, the PRA will identify the need for accelerated, interim remedial actions or response actions should conditions posing an imminent hazard exist. The PRA phase is based primarily on available information but may include limited field investigation as appropriate.

The scope of the PRA shall be based on limited DoD guidance for performing response actions on military ranges and EPA guidance for conducting CERCLA PAs, as well as USACE guidance on ordnance and explosive response actions under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) for Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS). The PRA shall consist of a limited-scope investigation designed to assess if there is a reasonable probability that the conditions at the CTT range could pose a hazard due to any military munitions, including unexploded ordnance (UXO), and/or other constituents found at the range.  Reports will utilize GIS file formats, as specified by the government, to document spatial information associated with the ranges. 

Other work which may be required at the discretion of the Navy includes revision of the risk assessment code (RAC) for the ranges that have undergone the PRA, sampling and geophysical surveys to confirm or deny suspected  burial sites, documentation of areas that require no further evaluation as well as interim response actions including marking, fencing, or removal and disposal of material containing ordnance and/or its constituents.  Additionally, at the discretion of the Government, subsequent phases of investigation deemed necessary for site disposition could be required.  

Firms are advised that work could potentially involve close contact with hazardous materials/wastes and UXO in various settings. Firms unable to accept work in these environments need not apply.

In the event that design services are required, the following pre-priced options may be exercised at the discretion of the government: 0 - 35% design, 35 - 100% design and Post Construction Contract Award Services (PCAS) such as shop drawing review/approval, consultation during construction, construction inspection services and preparation of record drawings. Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work, however, delays of up to one year are possible.

At the Government's discretion, issuance of requests for proposal, submission of proposals and contractual actions such as modifications to the contract, award of individual task orders and modifications thereto will utilize electronic documents.  Specific procedures for these processes will be established after award, however, the transmission of documents shall be in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards  Publication 186-2 (Digital Signature Standard) and documents will generally be transmitted in the Adobe Acrobat Format.  In addition, the selected firm must have on-line access to email via the internet for exchange of correspondence and information.

SIGNIFICANT EVALUATION FACTORS IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: 1. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE OF THE FIRM IN THE TYPE OF WORK DESCRIBED ABOVE.  2. PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS. Professional qualifications and relevant experience of staff to be assigned to this contract (including those of any consultant).  3. PAST PERFORMANCE. Past performance with respect to responsiveness, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules (emphasis on

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) is seeking an organization to provide assistance in specific areas of its extramural Program, with particular emphasis on the functions of the network of action/decision points committees which guide the progression of potentially useful anticancer and anti-AIDS agents through the entire preclinical drug discovery and development process. The activities of the DTP Program extend from the acquisition and input of new natural and synthetic materials into the system through the initial and secondary evaluations and subsequent preclinical development phases leading to approval for Phase I clinical trials.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Munitions Contracting Office (MNK), Eglin AFB, Florida is issuing this synopsis to provide all Advisory & Assistance (A&AS) for the Hull Hydrocode research program.  A sole source procurement Request For Proposal (RFP) is contemplated to be released on or about 19 April 2002 to General Dynamics Orlando Technology Incorporated, P.O. Box 855, Shalimar, Florida 32579.  The following A&AS includes but is not limited to the following, (1) expanding, modifying, and maintaining the hydrocode on sponsor chosen computer facilities, (2) exercising the code to model a wide variety of conventional warhead designs and warhead/penetrator phenomena, (3) providing consultative support in assessing conventional warhead designs and performing warhead technology studies, (4) performing conventional warhead test planning and data reduction, and (5) experimental testing at contractor's facilities or sponsor's test range for the verification of explosive and fracture models to be included in the hydrocode.  The testing and computational support must be performed locally.  The contractor will need sled test capabilities and a bulk modules test for live explosives.  

Expected task titles are as follows:  (1) HULL Hydrocode Maintenance, (2) High Explosive Research and Development Support, (3) Hard Target Smart Fuze Support, (4) Development of EFP Design and Control Criteria, (5) Smart Submunition Design, (6) Warhead Design, (7) Penetrator Case and Fuzewell Design.  Models incorporated into the code would first have to be tested on contractor's test range facility or on sponsor provided facility on Eglin AFB.  Such experimental work must be addressed in the submittal of particulars.  

A contractor providing this service will be required to:  (1) possess a current license of HULL or be willing to obtain one; (2) demonstrate capability to maintain and apply HULL hydrocode using Eglin AFB facilities; (3) demonstrate capabilities to modify existent HULL hydrocode by inclusion of new model developments, code architecture (programming theory), or altered equations in order to achieve acceptable performance in the applications required; (4) demonstrate technical competence and experience in the area of conventional warhead design through the use of hydrocodes, models and techniques other than hydrocodes, and actual testing and test data reduction; (5) possess 10 years of problem solving using HULL; and (6) provide sled test capabilities on a test range that is located within the local area, due to explosive shipping constraints and model development requirements.  GD-OTS has demonstrated the capability to modify HULL by inclusion of new model developments, code architecture and altered equations in order to achieve acceptable performance in the applications required.   GD-OTS has demonstrated technical competence in the areas of experimental design and computer modeling.  They designed, built and maintain the Piston Test and the Blast Box.  Both items are providing crucial information for the modeling of Penetrator Explosive Survivability and Reactive Fragmentation.  No other contractors possess these kinds of unique capabilities to fulfill this requirement for the period contemplated without imposing unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement and meeting the customers needs.  Any delay in extending the A&AS contract will result in an extremely negative impact on several programs supported under current Work Units.  
These programs include the HULL Hydrocode Support and Testing, Dense Inert Metal Program, Anti-Material and Hard Target Program, Unique Warhead Concept Program, MK-84 Insensitive Munitions Program and Multi-Event Fuze Program.  The technical support required by the A&AS Contract is critically essential to these programs.  Any delays in awarding this contract will produce significant schedule delays and negative mission impacts on the Unique Warhead Concept Program and the MK-84

INTRODUCTION: The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB), invites concept papers with preliminary cost estimates on innovative Air Expeditionary Force  (AEF) concepts.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Concept papers in response to this announcement shall be submitted to: 
366 CONS/LGCS, marked for BAA AEFB 02-0001, 366 Gunfighter Ave, Bldg 512 Suite 498, attn: SSgt Guin Peterson, Mountain Home AFB ID 83648.  Electronic submission of concept papers may be made to guinevere.peterson@mountainhome.af.mil by attaching the document to e-mail.  Responses should reference the above BAA number and provide telephone and email contact information.  This announcement is open and effective until 30 SEP 02.  Concept papers in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic and offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  Additionally, this BAA and all amendments and information related to this announcement will be posted electronically on the INTERNET at http://www.mountainhome.af.mil/AEFB and to the Federal Business Opportunities at http://www.eps.gov

B. OBJECTIVE: 
(1) Technical Description: The mission of the AEF Battlelab is to rapidly identify innovative and superior ways to plan and employ AEF capabilities, organize and train forces for AEF operations, and influence AEF doctrine and tactics in order to meet current and emerging missions.  This BAA solicits innovative concept papers addressing operational solutions to Air Force AEF needs.  Submit concept papers that address improvements within any of the phases of AEF operations (readiness, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment, and reconstitution).  Submissions should describe the expected benefit in terms of how the concept would reduce support structure, reduce response time, and/or increase combat capability and effectiveness of an AEF.  These concept papers may include, but are not limited to: new tactics, techniques, procedures, and technology applications that may affect Air Force doctrine and strategy.  The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of MATURING TECHNOLOGY.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis published January 22, 2002 under the above solicitation number.  This correction changes response dates and other dates within the synopsis.  The synopsis is corrected as follows: The Minerals Management Service is seeking qualified firms to enter into a revenue-sharing contract which will provide assistance in establishing the value of Bureau of Land Management natural gas storage services in the Rocky Mountain region. The successful firm will assist the Minerals Management Service through its technical expertise in evaluating transportation, gas storage and marketing services to develop terms and conditions and a pricing model to allow meaningful negotiations for Rocky Mountain area storage asset agreements. The contractor will work in partnership with MMS to perform market analysis and develop fair market price rates for a long-term gas storage agreement. It is possible that the firm will be asked to attend negotiations as a technical advisor. This acquisition will not be conducted under FAR Part 12. This procurement will consist of two phases. In Phase I, interested firms are invited to submit a brief qualification statement to address their ability to expertly perform this work. The MMS will screen qualification statements and invite qualified firms to participate in Phase II for final selection. The request for proposals will be issued only to the firms invited to participate in Phase II. A single award will be made based on evaluation of proposals pursuant to the RFP. Interested firms are encouraged to submit Phase I qualification statements addressing the following three areas: Area I, Experience: A. Demonstration of a minimum of five years of experience in managing natural gas storage assets; and B.

Area II, Technical Capability: A. General technical knowledge of natural gas storage engineering characteristics of capacity, working capacity, deliverability, pipeline integrity and management issues, and related issues; B. Specific technical knowledge of natural gas storage engineering characteristics of capacity, working capacity, deliverability, pipeline integrity and management issues, and related issues as they apply to storage assets in the Rocky Mountain area; C. General technical knowledge of economics and valuation of storage assets, including regulatory regimens; and D. Specific technical knowledge of economics and valuations of storage assets, including regulatory regimens as they apply to storage assets in the Rocky Mountain area, to include negotiated and approved storage rates, and the economic potential for both storage operators and storage users. Area III, Conflicts of Interest: Absence of direct conflicts of interest with respect to assistance in negotiations for storage agreements in the Rocky Mountain area. Qualification statements are not to be elaborate, and must be limited to five printed pages. No prices or cost data are to be submitted in Phase I. Firms will be notified on or about February 1, 2002 if they will be invited to continue to Phase II. A draft RFP will be issued only to those firms invited to participate in Phase II. A conference will be held with participating Phase II firms toward the purpose of discussing performance expectations and to solicit comments on the final form of the RFP. Final proposals are expected to be due on or about February 13, 2002. The target date for award is March 1, 2002, and the initial deliverables will be due by April 1, 2002.

<DESC>FED BIZ OPPS MARKET SURVEY/SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT
FOR
Submarine Trainers Database Development

BACKGROUND:

      The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) currently is delivering Virtual Environment Submarine Shiphandling Trainers (VESUB) 2000, Submarine Piloting and Navigation Trainers (SPAN) 2000 and Submarine Tactical Visual Training System (STVTS) 2000.  These trainers use an Image Generator (IG) to produce a visual scene of a harbor waterway as if the simulated submarine were traveling on the surface.  The trainers are used for team training for piloting, navigation, contact coordination, mooring/coming alongside and tactics.  The visual scenes are viewed by the trainee via several different display systems which provide the periscope operators, Officer of the Deck (OOD), Contact Coordinator, Navigator and Lookout the opportunity to pilot and navigate.  For piloting and navigation, geographically correct (Lat/Long) positions of navigation aids (water and land) and the visual appearance of the navigation aids (daymarks, buoys, ranges, tanks, towers, etc) are critical.   Currently there are five (5) databases available to exercise on these trainers.   A waterway database will contain all the key navigation aids found on the current NIMA-approved navigation chart of that portion of the waterway, including key terrain features as seen from a submarine's bridge.   The piers utilized in a particular portion of the waterway will also be modeled to train "departing from and coming along side a pier".   

PURPOSE:

     The purpose of this notice is to determine from an industry survey:  

&#61623; How many companies are in the business of developing databases and are interested in such an effort;
&#61623; The number of databases that have already been produced and thus exist in company inventories; and
&#61623; Whether these databases can be utilized within the noted trainers;  

      In addition, the NAWCTSD is interested in knowing some preliminary specifics about individual company capabilities as outlined below in the section entitled "Information Requested".

TECHNICAL CRITERIA:

For the visual scene, both the VESUB 2000 and SPAN 2000 use Computer Science Corporation Advance Marine Center?s Vship software.  Vship uses MultiGen-Paradigm's Vega application to control the models and display them visually.  The VESUB 2000 trainer runs on an SGI ONYX with the IRIX operating system and the SPAN 2000 trainer runs on a PC IG under Windows 2000.  The STVTS 2000 trainer application software is OpenGVS/OpenGL-based running on a PC IG under Windows 2000. 

The visual database for the Vship software utilizes standard .flt files (Version 15.4 or higher) for the visual scene and requires the following additional files (the government does not have the detailed design for these files):

&#61623; SCN file:  depth, bank, current file correlated to the database;
&#61623; lp file: light point file for buoys correlated to the database;
&#61623; xml file: information that is generic about harbor that is needed by Vship to run;
&#61623; obj file of model used to determine when collisions occur;
&#61623; dock file:  defines pier locations correlated to model; and
&#61623; Centerline/Channel model.

The visual database for the STVTS 2000 software utilizes standard .flt files and requires no additional files.

TASK DISCRIPTION:

NAWCTSD intends to procure the following 22 additional databases for use with the VESUB 2000, SPAN 2000 and STVTS 2000 trainers:

Yokusuka, Japan;

<SUBJECT>A -- High Molecular Weight Polyacrylmaides Polymer Technology
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TOCOMMERCIALIZE HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT POLYACRYLAMIDES POLYMER.


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's High Molecular Weight Polyacrylamides Polymer.

Scientists at LLNL invented a novel method to make high molecular weight polyacrylamides polymer solution for capillary electrophoresis and other types of electrophoresis.  The polymer has a viscosity average molecular weight (Mv) more than 700 kDa.  The high molecular weight of the polymer enables superior separation capacities of capillary electrophoresis than presently available products on the market.  For example, using the polymer as separation medium, scientists at LLNL achieved single base resolution up to 770 bases within 60 minutes with a capillary of 50 ?m i.d. and 40 cm effective length of separation of single stranded DNA.  Under the same conditions and using presently available product on the market, the separation needs 75 minutes and only can achieve single base resolution up to 625 bases.  The new polymer is easy to make with very low cost.  In addition, it has a long self-life (at least up to one year, at 70C).   LLNL is in the process to patent the invention.  At the mean time, LLNL is seeking for industrial partners to commercialize the invention.  LLNL is also looking for collaborative research and development to improve the invention and to explore other usages of the invention. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's High Molecular Weight Polyacrylamides Polymer should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO02-003-290.

Please provide your written statement within sixty (60) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's High Molecular Weight Polyacrylamides Polymer.

<OFFADD>Department of Energy, Bechtel Jacobs Environmental Management Co. (DOE Contractor), Inorganic Membrane Technology Lab, P.O. Box 4699, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831-7271
<SUBJECT>A -- COLLABORATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF INORGANIC FILTERS AND MEMBRANES
<DESC>Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC OPPORTUNITY FOR COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (CRADA): Inorganic Membranes and Filters.

SUMMARY: The Inorganic Membrane Technology Laboratory (IMTL) of Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC (BJC) is seeking to enter at least one Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). The goal is to develop application-specific filters and membranes of inorganic materials, including metals, metal alloys, oxides, carbides, nitrides, etc., for commercial use. IMTL can quickly design and prototype a functioning tubular filter or membrane, with a pore size in the range of 5 angstroms to 50 microns, meeting the Participant's specification. IMTL's approach is based on proven economical large-scale manufacturing methods.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A CRADA is not a grant, and is not a contract for the procurement of goods/services. This notice is seeking Participant(s) for involvement in FUNDS-IN CRADA(s). BJC IS PROHIBITED FROM TRANSFERRING FUNDS TO A CRADA PARTICIPANT.

The CRADA Participant will have an option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to subject inventions arising under the CRADA. The CRADA Participant in this endeavor is expected to commit technical personnel commensurate with the level of research activities defined by the CRADA Statement of Work. It is anticipated that IMTL facilities and/or those of the CRADA Participant will be utilized, as appropriate, for the research activities as defined by the Statement of Work. IMTL requires the CRADA Participant to provide complete funding for the project. For the subject technology the CRADA Participant must be a US company. A favorable Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence Certification (FOCI) determination is required prior to commencement of a CRADA. Any membrane/filter product(s) arising under the CRADA shall be reviewed and approved by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) prior to granting approval for commercial deployment. Manufacturing will be restricted to DOE approved facilities.

Certain licenses to this technology are currently held by a US-owned company, Pall Corporation of East Hills, New York (see www.pall.com).  The current licensed products are: (1) metal and intermetallic filters, and (2) layered membranes of metal, metal oxide, and carbon having porous metal substrates. Pall Corporation, under its licenses from Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC, has developed a family of 12 unique filter/membrane products through several CRADAs with IMTL and currently manufactures the DOE-approved products in a secure facility in Oak Ridge, TN. 

IMTL is operated by Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC for DOE under contract DE-AC05-98OR22700.  Inquiries regarding CRADA proposals and scientific matters may be forwarded at any time. Proprietary, preliminary CRADA proposals, preferably five pages or less, must be submitted to the IMTL by March 4, 2002. Guidelines for preparing final CRADA proposals will be provided shortly thereafter to all respondents with whom initial proprietary discussions will have established sufficient mutual interest. CRADA proposals submitted at a later date may be considered if a suitable CRADA Participant has not been selected. Background and contact information for IMTL and BJC are available at the following web sites: http://www.inorganicmembranes.org/ and http://www.bechteljacobs.com/. (Inquiries and proposals regarding this opportunity should be addressed to John A. Clinard, Director of IMTL, P.O. Box 4699, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831-7271.
