<DESC>This synopsis is for a Multiple Year, Indefinite Delivery Requirements Contract (IDRC) for the procurement of sole source, part-numbered items manufactured by GE CAGEs 99207 and 77482.  This acquisition supports the tenets of streamlining by employing a Joint Opportunity whereby DLA consumables as well as Depot Level Reparables (DLRs) are combined in a single acquisition strategy using long term contracting procedures.  A single award is anticipated.  The key component of this Strategic Supplier Alliance (SSA) will be the ability to effectively provide management visibility into efficiency and productivity of the contract. 

DSCR currently does not have a competitive data package for any of the 7,364 DLA consumable NSNs or 393 DLRs included in this solicitation. The initial phase will consist of approximately 699 NSNs (both DLA consumables and DLRs) which are anticipated to be awarded at time of basic contract award.  The NSNs, part numbers, and annual estimated quantities are available upon request and will also be posted at the Strategic Acquisition Directorate website.  Alternate offers must submit a complete technical data package for each NSN for approval in order to be considered for award. Terms are FOB Origin, inspection/acceptance at origin, DLA Direct shipments only.  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) applicable to DLRs only.  Other than Full and Open Competition- 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1).  Sole Source Reference FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).

Solicitation is expected to result in an IDRC that is firm, fixed pricing with incentives.  The Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the governments requirements and includes metrics to monitor contractor performance.  DLA Surge & Sustainment requirements apply to the DLA consumable items.  Pricing will be based on the Estimated Annual Demand (EAD) quantity.  Required items are commercial and military unique. Required delivery is to be negotiated for each item.  

The solicitation is expected to be issued on March 30, 2010 with a closing date of April 30, 2010.  A copy of the solicitation is available via the DLA-BSM Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil on the issue date cited in the RFP.  From the DIBBS homepage, select RFP/IFBs from the top of the page.  Then choose the appropriate Search Category & Search Value, then click Submit in order to view the RFP.  RFPs are in portable document format (PDF).  To download and view this document you will need the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader.  This software is available free at: http://www.adobe.com.

<DESC>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of the National Weather Service's National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) for vessel services to provide towing vessel, crew, fuel, consumables, additional hawser, additional tag lines, and all materials required to retrieve four (4) six (6) meter moored NOAA Hurricane/Weather buoys and tow/transport the buoys to the dock at the U.S. Coast Guard station in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW), dated December 2, 2014.
<p>Background Information: NOAA buoy 41A44 was deployed near station "41044" (330 nautical miles North East of St. Martin Island, at position 21&deg;33'43.20"N 58&deg;36'50.40"W) on April 07, 2012. NOAA buoy 42A60 was deployed near station "42060" (164 nautical miles South East of Puerto Rico at position 16&deg;19'23.52"N 63&deg;29'26.92"W) on May 26, 2011. NOAA buoy 41A46 was deployed near station "41046" (342 nautical miles North West of Puerto Rico at position  23&deg;54'16.00"N 68&deg;18'5.00"W) on June 14, 2011. NOAA buoy 41B41 was previously recovered and towed into port and is now moored in Fort-de-France, Martinique. The photos in the SOW show similar buoys being towed from the pad eye on the bow (left) and from the 75 feet mooring chain that is attached to the yoke below the buoy (right).  Appendix 1 of the SOW shows the mooring diagrams for buoys 41044, 42060 &amp; 41046.<br /><br />Each buoy contains sensors, electronics and batteries for collecting and transmitting weather data.  The buoy still contains 220 air-alkaline batteries (Cegasa AS10-2, approximately 20 pounds each, see appendix 2 for MSDS).  NOAA no longer uses this type of buoy and no longer has a need for this hull.<br /> <br />The Government will send a technician to the docking location to check all buoy compartments for hazardous atmosphere (oxygen and explosive gases) and make the compartments safe to open and enter. The Contractor shall not open any of the buoy compartments. They will dismantle the buoys and prepare them for shipment back to Stennis Space Center, Mississippi. The Government will pay the cost of transporting the buoy away from the dock. See attached Statement of Work (SOW), dated December 2, 2014, for additional information. Also, additional background information can be found on our website at: http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/.</p>
<p>The four (4) recovered six (6) meter buoys <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will not</span></em></strong> be turned over to the contractor for salvage/scrap. The four (4) buoys will be secured at the U.S. Coast Guard station at the San Juan, Puerto Rico dock port before the Government makes arrangements to transfer ownership to the US Coast Guard for salvage.<br /><br />This is a best value, competitive requirement. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced quoter or to the quoter with the highest technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>The following factors, which are listed in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />(1) Technical; <br />(2) Past Performance; and <br />(3) Price<br /><br />Factors 1 and 2, when combined, are significantly more important than price.<br /><br />This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 483111 Deep Sea Freight Transportation. The small business size standard is 500 employees. NOAA anticipates awarding one firm fixed-price contract as a result of this solicitation. The solicitation and proposed fixed-price contract will be issued utilizing FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items. All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency. To be eligible for award, vendors must obtain a DUNS number (this may be done by calling 1-800-333-0505) and be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM): www.sam.gov. The solicitation will be available electronically on or about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 23, 2015 </span></strong>via FedBizOpps at www.fedbizopps.gov. Amendments to the solicitation will also be provided on the Internet using the same protocol listed above. Telephone requests for hard copies will not be honored.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />All questions concerning this solicitation should be addressed to Kurt.Weilbaecher@noaa.gov. Quotes will be accepted electronically at the following email address: Kurt.Weilbaecher@noaa.gov and Andrew.Hildebrandt@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>Scope of Work for HRSG #2 Initial Work Request

Given the results of the hydrostatic test performed on HRSG #2, or lack thereof with the amount of leaking, NAVFAC UEM is issuing a work request to replace all leaking tubes within the unit and restore it to full functionality.  Based upon previous repair work this would require at most a total of twenty (20) leaking/access tubes being removed and replaced.  Upon removal of known leaking tubes after each hydrostatic test, it is recommended that said tubes be plugged and an additional hydrostatic test administered to determine if there are any other leaks until all the leaking tubes have been eliminated.  A final hydrostatic test is required once all the leaking tubes have been replaced as per the original contract to demonstrate that the boiler is in working order.
  All applicable management/oversight and documentation utilizing the criteria stated within the original contract is also required.  All work in this initial request shall adhere to the requirements, codes, etc. stated within the original contract.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION BUT A SYNOPSIS NOTIFICATION.  NAICS CODE IS 238220.  SIZE STANDARD IS $15 MILLION.  THE SOLICITATION (N40085-15-R-3806) WILL BE POSTED ON OR AROUND DECEMBER 24, 2014.  DAVIS BACON WAGE RATES WILL APPLY. 

The anticipated award will be a basic IDIQ contract with a performance period of 150 days.  The seed project will be a task order immediately upon award of the IDIQ contract.  The seed project is valued at approximately $20,000 - 25,000.00.

<DESC>The VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Sirtex Medical Inc.  The proposed contract action is for the purchase of Yttrium-90 (Y-90) Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) microspheres with associated materials.          

Y-90 is a critical tool to ensure VA patients are treated effectively for liver tumors.  Selected patients will be provided Y-90 treatments for liver cancer.  Unlike conventional external beam radiation, Y-90 selectively irradiates a liver tumor which provides the ability to deliver more potent doses of radiation directly to the cancer cells over a longer period.     

Sirtex Medical Inc. is the sole supplier of Y-90.    

This sole source action is in accordance with the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; however, any firm that believes it can provide an equivalent product may give written notification to the Contracting Officer for consideration. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements. Responses are due by January 30, 2015 at 4:30 PM PST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Responses must be e-mailed to gary.basile@va.gov .  No telephone responses will be accepted.  No reimbursement for any costs associated with providing capability statements will be provided by the Government.

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">While HVE is an effective and proven countermeasure to increase seat belt use and reduce unrestrained fatalities, secondary laws provide unique challenges for law enforcement in these efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many states without a primary seat belt law indicate that it is difficult to enforce the secondary seat belt law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By providing law enforcement new effective strategies in secondary states, agencies may be able to overcome some of the obstacles that a secondary law creates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Research has shown that secondary states with the greatest improvements in seat belt use had much greater levels of enforcement than secondary States with the least change; 3 to 4 times as many citations per capita (see "Analyzing the First Years of the Click It or Ticket Mobilizations"; Preusser Research Group, Inc. January 2010; Julie Tison and Allan F. Williams).</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">However, NHTSA recognizes that the proven enforcement strategies along with a required combination of new strategies and interventions are needed to change the status quo of the 29 States with a safety belt use rate below the national average of 87 percent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="COLOR: #000100">Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Occupant Protection Survey (NOPUS) indicate </span>that the percent of unrestrained vehicle occupants killed in traffic crashes remains alarmingly high, near 50 percent, despite a national seat belt use at 87 percent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">To ensure continued progress in increasing the national safety belt use rate and in decreasing the number of unrestrained passenger vehicle occupant fatalities, the agency must continue to explore innovative strategies for increasing occupant restraint use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Distracted driving is an issue that has received increased media coverage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In response, many States have implemented laws to ban drivers from using hand-held cell phones or texting while driving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), as of November, 2014, 44 States and the District of Columbia have laws banning text messaging by drivers and an additional 4 States have texting laws specific to novice drivers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are fewer laws banning hand-held phone use by drivers, with only 14 States (i.e., California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia) and the District of Columbia having such laws.<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1"><sup><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><sup><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[1]</span></sup></span></sup></a><sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Distracted driving laws vary across the States in how they are written and how they can be enforced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some laws specify particular behaviors, such as reading, writing, or sending a text message, but don't include the many other actions that could be completed on a hand-held device, such as dialing a phone number, searching the internet, or emailing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Laws like this require enforcement to differentiate between particular actions, a requirement identified as challenging by States in the 2012 GHSA Distracted Driving Survey.<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2"><span><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[2]</span></span></span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, Indiana reported, "Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is being enforced, but lightly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many officers are reluctant to enforce it because they claim they cannot tell if someone is dialing a number or texting."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The GHSA survey suggests States are having problems enforcing distracted driving laws, which may, at least partially, explain why respondents reported such low awareness of distracted driving enforcement in NHTSA's 2012 National Survey on Distracted Driving Attitudes and Behaviors.<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3" name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3"><sup><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><sup><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[3]</span></sup></span></sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Due to the increasing number of law enforcement agencies that are mobilizing to enforce State legislation restricting hand-held phone and texting use, and the apparent challenges faced by States to enforce such laws, providing a comprehensive picture of the laws across the States, including the challenges faced by enforcement and the strategies used to overcome those challenges, will help produce effective enforcement actions, and stimulate the issuance of citations for drivers who engage in these dangerous behaviors.</span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Technology Applications Office is currently seeking sources capable of providing all necessary management, resources, hardware, and technical service expertise to provide, upgrade, maintain, edit, integrate, and enhance .HIE formatted visual databases as required for a given geographic area in varying degrees of resolution.   <br>  <br> This is a combined Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought announcement only. This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any products or services. No formal solicitation document exists at this time. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Your response will be treated as information only, and any requests for solicitation will not receive a response.  <br>  <br> No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the government will arise as a result of contractor submission of response or government use of such information. Any information submitted by respondents to this notice is strictly voluntary. The government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input. The information resulting may be included in an RFP, which may be released via the fbo.gov portal and Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) FedBizOps. <br>  <br> Technology Applications Office is issuing this RFI as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to support, existing Combat Mission Simulators (CMS) used by the United States Army.  The results of this market research will contribute to solidifying the acquisition strategy and determining the method of procurement. All personnel performing work under this acquisition will require, at a minimum, a secret security clearance. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541519, Other Computer Related Services. <br>  <br> Objective:  The U.S. Army has a requirement to procure visual databases, database upgrades, database enhancements, and associated interoperable hardware with its current CMS devices.  To comply with the government's Performance Specification(s) for the Common Visual System for its existing 47 and 60 series CMS, it is required that database production, upgrades, and enhancements are developed and provided in .HIE format.  Providing such databases will ensure correlation with out-the-window and sensor databases already in use within the CMS devices listed above.  In addition, only databases in this format are fully compliant with the custom scripts and configuration management software utilized by unified storage capability already fielded by the government.   <br>  <br> The government's requirement includes potential .HIE database development for large land areas (120,000 sq km) with imagery source resolutions goals between seven centimeters and one meter, depending on the government's requirement for specific regions within the geographic region identified for database development.     <br>  <br> Hardware to be procured through this action will support the use of existing databases, as well as databases, upgrades, and enhancements to be procured.  Specifically, image generators shall directly ingest geospatial data in the .HIE format. <br>  <br> Constraints: The following are some of the constraints that impact the performance of the services under CMS database acquisition: <br>  <br> Secret Security Clearance:  <br>  <br> Secret Security Clearance, based on a National Agency Check completed within ten years is required.  All work performed during .HIE database development will be unclassified.  All personnel working at the Government locations would be required to hold a current Secret clearance. <br>  <br> Work Locations: <br>  <br> All .HIE database development work would be performed at contractor facilities and unless otherwise directed by the government. <br>  <br> Additional integration work would be performed at various locations throughout the United States and abroad. <br>  <br> Contract Terms:  <br>  <br> In an effort to maximize participation all potential sources are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist in determining the potential levels of interest, competition, and technical capability to provide the required services.

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Admnistration, under FAR 13, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Sharma and Associates of Hinsdale, IL for phase III of the "Objective Evaluation of Risk Reduction From Tank Car Design and Operations Improvement."<br /><br />&nbsp;
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Sharma &amp; Associates, Inc. has performed Phase I and currently worked on Phase II of a contract resulted from the Broad Agency Announcement. The results of Phase I were very satisfactory and useful on the development of a proposed rule "Hazardous Materials: Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains" </span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This contract is intended to expand upon the work performed by Sharma &amp; Associates, Inc. (SA) for the United States Department of Transport (US DOT).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This work involved SA combining finite element modeling, train dynamics simulation and experimental data to develop a method to determine the probability that a given tank car would be punctured in a derailment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This contract seeks to expand those same models and procedures, along with developing new models and procedures, to determine the probability that a tank car would be breached in a derailment and to further expand the approach to include a larger range of tank car designs (including novel constructions) and alternate operating conditions such as reduced speeds, use of distributed power (DP), Electrically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes, etc.,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and a more detailed review/validation of the methodology .</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Consequently, there are several reasons why this project cannot be completed in a cost-effective way that meets government requirements by another contractor:</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">1.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SA has completed the first two phases of this work. An estimate of the total time to redevelop this work would be 9 months and $225,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, significant additional time and cost would be incurred if another company were to perform this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">2.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The research that has been conducted is highly specialized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While the computational modeling tools and techniques used in the research are relatively common in industry, the specialization and application to rail tank cars is very limited.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Few work in the area of tank car puncture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The individual finite element models of train cars, the individual train models used in the dynamics modeling packages, the method to combine all of these models to determine the risk that a given train car will be punctured in a derailment, and the methods used to validate this work with experimental data are all proprietary and solely owned by SA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The use of a different contractor would require extensive preparation on background information, familiarization with the methodology, familiarization with the already collected databases, and create new simulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Such preparation would require time, thereby introducing delay into the timely completion of this project, and would also cost the Government considerable additional money.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received by the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.

Evaluation Criteria/Basis of Award

Award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforms to the solicitation that will be most advantageous to the Government on the basis of a fair and reasonable price, technical capability, delivery, and past performance.

Mandatory Electronic Invoicing 

VA published the final rule requiring vendors to submit invoices electronically to the Financial Services Center (FSC) in the November 27, 2012 Federal Register. The rule became effective December 27, 2012. The rule includes a new contract clause to be inserted in all solicitations and contracts by the contracting officer (VAAR 852.232-72). Vendors can comply with the rule by using either of the two methods below:

1. The FSC uses a third-party contractor, OB10, to transition vendors from paper to electronic invoice submission. For information on OB10 electronic invoicing set-up, vendors should call 877-752-0900, or email USClientServices@ob10.com .

2. A system that conforms to the X12 electronic data interchange (EDI) format established by the Accredited Standards Center. For FSC e-Invoicing information, please call 877-353-9791 or email vafsccshd@va.gov.

FSC and VA's Office of Acquisition, Logistics and Construction (OALC) will assist existing commercial vendors in migrating to the electronic process. Until the transition to electronic format is complete, FSC will continue to process paper invoices for commercial vendors. 

The FSC's electronic invoicing system provides a variety of flexible solutions for all vendor types, including small businesses, and does not require any vendor transaction fees. More information on the FSC electronic invoicing process can be found at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp.Contracting Office Address:

<p>Details: Tactical Training and Exercise Control Group (1-1 ECG) requires replacement of a 384 square foot, 3-dimensional terrain model of Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center that is part of the Combined Arms Staff Trainer (CAST) in building 1587. The terrain model shall replicate the geographic terrain in 3 dimensions at a scale of 1:12,000 with an accuracy of +1- 0.005 inch in full color from digital geospatial data. The terrain model consists of sturdy panels 48 inches by 96 inches that seamlessly join together with the elevations matching along the seams creating one large 3D topographic terrain model suitable for marking with dry erase markers or positioning pieces that represent military units. The terrain model will be used by Marines to physically interact with the model to conduct military mapping rehearsals. The terrain model shall be a geo-spatially accurate, three-dimensional solid model of the area.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c) and FAR 6.303, the Marine Corps. has provided justification to procure only the Solid Terrain Modeling, Inc. brand name product that is recommended by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) as described above. The requested model is a logical follow on to a 1987 model that is currently in use by the TTECG. Market Research found was found that although several commercial manufacturers have the capability to create terrain models with plaster models, vacuum forming, additive (layering) techniques, and dynamic techniques, the level of accuracy produced from these terrain models did not meet the standards required in the accompanying Statement of Work. Additionally, the terrain model panels must measure no less than 48 inches by 96 inches in order to reduce the number of seams on the model in order to a realistic simulation. No manufacturers other than Solid Terrain Modeling, Inc. were found who can produce terrain model panels of this size with the required level of detail, accuracy, and durability. A brand name or equal quote will be accepted. <br /><br />Award is subject to the term and conditions as followed:<br /><br />- This award is being set aside for small businesses in accordance with FAR Part 19.502<br />- The initial award will be based on lowest price technically acceptable.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.<br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.<br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]<br />(5) <br />(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may-<br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or<br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause.<br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.<br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to--<br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or<br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.<br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.<br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.<br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.<br />(3) Ceiling price.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.<br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):<br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract.<br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment-<br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);<br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;<br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and<br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.<br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost-<br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and<br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.<br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments.

In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p><br />(ii) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NHLBI-CSB-HI-2015-053-CDB and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). Offerors shall submit their proposals no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time(EST) on Friday, January 30, 2015. Questions shall be submitted no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 22, 2015.</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document, the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78, effective December 26, 2014.</p>
<p>(iv) The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112 and the small business size standard is 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to procure a maintenance agreement for various laboratory equipment/instruments located in the core facilities in the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). <br />&emsp;<br />BACKGROUND:<br /><br />The mission of the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) is to perform robust scientific and clinical research leading to a better understanding of biology and clinical pathology. To attain this goal, we have built a strong basic science foundation and coupled it closely with innovative technology development and outstanding clinical research both at the NIH Clinical Center and in partnership with local hospitals.</p>
<p>The purview of our research is broad, encompassing investigations into the basic principles of molecular, cellular, and organ-level biology and their relationship to disease. Some current areas of fundamental interest include single molecule structure; protein assembly; molecular and cell biology; cell signaling and motility; membrane trafficking; physiology; systems biology; engineering and technology development. Insights into disease mechanisms derived from basic studies form the basis for translational research into new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>DIR investigators also conduct concept-based clinical studies in the areas of interventional and surgical cardiology; pulmonary medicine; sickle cell anemia; bone marrow transplant; and hematologic disorders. Providing state-of-the-art training in basic, translational, and clinical research for the next generation of scientific and clinical leaders is a high priority. This program provides opportunities for scientists and trainees to work together towards a better understanding of molecular machines, the cell, the body, and ultimately the treatment of human diseases.</p>
<p>The Genetics and Developmental Biology Center (GDBC) is dedicated to investigating the roles of genes and gene networks in a variety of biological processes related to organismal development and the maintenance of homeostasis. In addition, there is a significant emphasis on understanding the molecular mechanisms by which these cellular regulatory components are disrupted to cause disease, and how they can be manipulated to develop new gene-based and other therapies. GDBC investigators make use of a variety of approaches to answer these questions, including model genetic systems like Drosophila, fluorescent imaging, and genomic technologies.</p>
<p>Due to flooding problems in the lab, the darkroom will be removed. Fluorescent microscopes work best in dark conditions, therefore, the modification and upgrade of the fluorescent microscope is required so that it can be used effectively in a&nbsp;lit environment.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and under the authority of FAR 13 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotation (RFQ) is for a mobile ultraviolet (UV) spectrometer that will be used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Air Enforcement Division (AED) for detecting single digit parts per billion (ppb) concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, styrene, formaldehyde, and sulfur dioxide in order to target strong sources of these compounds from considerable distances outside of industrial fence lines, and for use during aerial surveys of marine vessel emissions.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-79.  This procurement is not set-aside for small business.  The NAICS code is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:   EPA requires a mobile UV spectrometer with sensitivities to the gases listed above of at least equal to that of the Duvas Model DV3000-P model.  A mobile UV spectrometer with lower sensitivity than the Duvas DV3000-P is not sufficient to meet EPA?s requirements for emissions source targeting during Clean Air Act Compliance investigations and for other regulatory purposes. DELIVERY LOCATION:  The system shall be delivered, FOB destination, to US EPA Headquarters W.J. Clinton Building South, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Rm. 1142A, Washington, DC 20460.
EVALUATION FACTORS:  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order to the responsible vendor whose quote, conforming to the RFQ provisions, will provide the best value to the Government, considering the technical factor and price.  The non-price evaluation factor is the ability to meet the stated technical requirements.  Non-price factors are significantly more important than price.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.223-18, 52.225-13.  QUOTE SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  Quotes shall be submitted via e-mail to Michael Gilham, Contracting Officer at the below address, and must be received by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on January 23, 2015.   Any questions regarding this RFQ must be submitted to Michael Gilham via e-mail.

<p>11. STATEMENT OF WORK/POSITION DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>I. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>A. Introduction:</p>
<p>The Democracy, Human Rights and Governance sector in Liberia faces a complex set of challenges. Liberia has experienced greater stability and security since 2005 and enjoys considerable freedom of expression and association and a significantly improved human rights environment. However, significant challenges in improving government accountability and rule of law, as well as political accountability and competition, remain. The consequences of the lack of accountability manifest themselves in continued corruption and impunity at every level of government, which combined with a general lack of capacity, has resulted in low public confidence in government. Lack of political accountability and competition have resulted in continued executive dominance and the inability of the legislature and judiciary to act as checks on the executive. Access to information remains constrained, and civil society and media are weak, making it difficult for society to address these constraints.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, USAID/Liberia's Democracy, Rights and Governance (DRG) Office supports more effective, accountable and inclusive governance, by strengthening accountable management of public resources, increasing access to justice, strengthening capacity to implement election processes, and building civil society and media's capacity to exercise their advocacy and oversight roles. The Democracy, Rights and Governance Office presently has an average annual budget of $30 million and a staff complement of five US Direct Hires and six Liberians. The office is implementing programs in good governance and public sector reform, rule of law and access to justice, elections and political processes, and civil society and media.</p>
<p>The good governance and public sector reform portfolio consists of a technical assistance project to develop and implement capacity development within selected Government of Liberia's (GoL's) Ministries and Agencies in core public administration functions, and to improve the public sector management of private sector concessions, ICT, and national payment systems. It builds the capacity of the Liberia Institute of Public Administration to deliver trainings that are responsive to the capacity development needs of the GoL. Additional support to the GoL's Public Financial Management Reform Strategy is also provided through contribution to the Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Program Multi-Donor Trust Fund which seeks to improve budget planning and execution, fiscal policy management, financial control, and oversight of government finances through support to internal and external audit functions, as well as legislative audit oversight. USAID is also the largest contributor to the Public Sector Modernization Multi-Donor Trust Fund which works with seven participating ministries to improve payroll processes, performance, and management of the civil service. A program to support the GoL's decentralization strategy is anticipated to begin in late FY 14. Public sector reform is a cross-cutting focus of USAID Liberia, managed by the DRG Office, in close coordination with the Program Office and the Education, Health, and Economic Growth teams.</p>

<p>Specifications:</p>
<p>USU will use the following, not as exclusive specifications but, as illustrative specifications.  The following specifications will be factored into our Best Value evaluation: The more of the following an interested offeror can offer, the more highly its quote will be evaluated.</p>
<p>Desired Specifications:<br />a.	Color: White;<br />b.	Material: Polyester/Cotton blend (at least 55% and no more than 85% polyester);<br />c.	Length: Waist-length;<br />d.	Sleeves: Long;<br />e.	Three buttons on front;<br />f.	Two lower outer pockets;<br />g.	One outer left-chest pocket; and<br />h.

<p>Offerors responding to this requirement must provide pricing, at a minimum, for the following contract line item numbers (CLINs)*:</p>
<p>* Refer to the attached CLIN Structure spreadsheet.  Please note there are two sheets to be completed in the Excel file.</p>
<p>In order to be considered for award, offerors must provide a quote for all CLINS listed.</p>
<p>USU owns patches that need be sewn on the outer left-chest pocket.  The patches are 4 X 3-1/2 X 1/8 inches [see the attached jpg picture for a sample].  USU can ship these patches to the awardee for this service.  Offerors must note that the integrity of the pocket must not be compromised.  Offerors should state in the quote package with pricing if this is a service they can provide.</p>
<p>The coats must be delivered by February 9, 2015.  If the patches can be sewn over the pocket, the coats may be delivered by February 17, 2015.  The required delivery dates for the future option years will be determined annually.  USU will disclose these dates at least two weeks prior to delivery.</p>
<p>Evaluation / Award Detail:</p>
<p>The Government intends to issue a single, five-year, firm-fixed priced (FFP) purchase order (PO) to the offeror representing the best value to the Government based on the evaluation factors listed below.  Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance, with most important listed first.  The Government will conduct a trade-off between price and non-price factors.  The Government is not required to award to the lowest priced offeror or the offeror quoting the highest technically rated item.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors (in order of importance):</p>
<p>1.	Technical.  Offerors must quote products that reflect the desired specifications outlined in the Minimum Specifications section.  To demonstrate, offerors must provide product literature for the quoted items.  Offerors must also indicate whether the required delivery date of February 9, 2015 can be met (or February 17, 2015 for the inclusion of the patch service).  If unable to meet this date, offerors must provide an alternative date when the delivery can be made.</p>
<p>2.	Price.  Offerors must include all applicable costs, e.g. shipping, in the quote.  The total quoted price for all components will be the evaluated price.  Offerors should include their preferred method of payment.  USU prefers to make payment(s) using the Visa Government Purchase Card (GPC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />In addition to providing the product literature, offerors must also submit a copy of the completed CLIN Structure spreadsheet* in the quote package.  Those offerors who fail to provide this copy in the quote package may be deemed nonresponsive:</p>
<p>CLINs 0001 through 0022: Consultation lab coats for women and men<br />Desired Specifications	Quoted Specification	Reference Page No. in the Quote Package/Product Literature<br />Color: White		<br />Material: Polyester/Cotton blend (at least 55% and no more than 85% polyester)		<br />Length: Waist-length		<br />Sleeves: Long		<br />Three buttons on front		<br />Two lower outer pockets		<br />One outer left-chest pocket		<br />Must in be in numeric sizing as listed in the CLIN Structure attachment (no XS, M, XL, etc.)		<br />* Refer to the attached CLIN Structure spreadsheet.  Please note there are two sheets to be completed in the Excel file.</p>
<p>Quoted items must be new.  Quotes for refurbished equipment will not be considered.</p>
<p>Offerors must also indicate in quote where item is manufactured.  Offerors may provide quotes for multiple coat models.</p>
<p>The Federal Government prefers not to use third-party-payment merchants, e.g. PayPal, to exchange currencies.  This is because these merchants can mask the actual merchant/vendor and impede the Government's effort to promote transparency.  If these third-party-payment merchants must be used, offeror must include a compelling justification in the quote package.  This will be considered as a part of the Price evaluation factor.</p>
<p>Items will be shipped to Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>See attached list for applicable provisions and clauses for this requirement.  Offerors must submit a copy of completed Required Provisions.  Failure to do so may result in the quote package being deemed nonresponsive.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>

Any question received after 2:00PM ET on January 22, 2015 will not be answered.  Questions will not be answered over the phone or submitted by any other means.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.<br />B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as "No Charge" by entering "NC" in the unit price. <br />c.

In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>AMENDMENT ISSUED TO PROVIDE 2 (TWO) ECP DOCUMENTS THAT MIGHT BE OF USE TO A POTENTIAL QUOTER: JXN-13ECP-137 WHICH<br />CHANGED DWG REVISION LEVEL TO "B" AND JXN-14ECP-088 WHICH CHANGED DWG REVISION LEVEL TO "C". THESE ECPs ARE<br />ALREADY INCORPORATED INTO THE CURRENT DRAWINGS THEMSELVES. SO THERE SHOULD NOT BE A CHANGE TO WHAT YOU ARE<br />LOOKING AT. AT BEST, IT JUST MAKES IT EASIER FOR A VENDOR TO SEE CHANGES IF THEY HAVE AN OLDER DRAWING VS THE<br />CURRENT VERSION. ALL OTER TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CLOSING DATE AND TIME ARE UNCHANGED.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0004 EFFECTIVE 01/20/2015  THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO:  1.  TO INCORPORATE QUESTIONS ASKED AND ANSWERED AS FOLLOWS:  Question 9: What is the need or usage of PPD? Answer 9: This is what stated is in the requirements.  Both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. One advantage of PPD is that because the backup is straightforward, it takes less time. A disadvantage of PPD, however, is that the storage administrator must have enough space to store the full backup somewhere until the duplicate data is removed. In case this adds time to the process and uses a lot more storage disk space.  Question 10: Is there a reason or requirement to have the full data (redundant data) stored for later retrieval? Answer 10: Yes that is the requirement.  Inline deduplication reduces data while it is being sent to the backup device while post- process backs up data first, and then reduces it. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. Post-processing backs up data faster and reduces the backup window, but requires more disk because backup data is temporarily stored... As we know, with Post-Process Deduplication: A block of data comes into the appliance and is written to storage entirely. Then a separate process reads the block and checks it for redundancy. If it has been processed before (is considered to be a duplicate), it is deleted and replaced with a reference. If the block does not have matches, no changes are made. This method shortens time of data transfer from the source to storage but it requires more free space on a server disk and a lot more I/O than in-line.  In-line deduplication: It can be performed on the client side or when data is being transferred from the source to server. A block of data comes into the appliance, which analyses if that block has been processed before. If so, it throws away the redundant block and writes a reference to it. If the block of data is unique, the appliance writes it to the storage. Thus, data block analysis is initiated before it is written. This method of deduplication performs most of the work in RAM, which minimizes I/O overhead and provides disk space savings. Nevertheless, despite its resource-intensity and possible delays, in-line method increases efficiency of global deduplication since immediate processing of data stream coming from several sources allows eliminating duplicates on the fly. Question 11: Will it satisfy to have just In-Line Deduplication on the BackUp Device? Answer 11: In-line deduplication on backup solution is acceptable. There is also a solution that we use for back ups from a central repository to a DR site that stores the data as it comes in and it is stored to both sites simultaneously. This is used in worse case scenarios where having no single point of failure with a full redundant HA Failover back up solution is a must and having data available at all times in case of outages, (Force Majeure) with a back up solution that if one site goes down, the other site will have the data and it is readily accessible. No down time to bring data back up and online. Question 12: Will you be interested in knowing more about our HA Back up solution? Answer 12: Not at this time.  Back to PPD and Inline Deduplication. Other advantages is that Inline deduplication recognizes redundant data as it comes in from several different backup data streams and won't forward the full block to target media if it knows it must be duplicated. Performance will usually improve over time as the data deduplication product becomes used to the data set it has to work with and data reduction ratios will improve toward an optimal maximum. Post-process deduplication also looks for duplicated data blocks and replaces them with a pointer to the first iteration of that block. But unlike inline deduplication, post-process deduplication doesn't begin processing backup data until after it has all arrived at the backup target. So, if you regularly back up large amounts of redundant data, you'll be using resources to pump it all into the backup target unreduced. This can cause a head ache with bottlenecking. The primary requirement of post-process data deduplication is that there's enough disk capacity to store the largest potential backup your likely to carry out. If you want to minimize backup times, post-process deduplication could be your best bet. Post-process deduplication has no impact on the length of the backup window. Backup operations are completely unaffected, with data deduplication carried out once the data set is on the target disk. However, if you need to replicate deduped data to an offsite location for disaster recovery (DR), it will work out better to go with inline deduplication instead of sending un- deduplicated data across the (WAN) and then dealing with it post-process. Impact of data deduplication on tape backups Post-process deduplication can be the better choice when you plan to copy data from disk to tape soon after backup. For that reason, if you want to copy to tape soon after backup, it can be done more easily if you have the un-deduplicated data set to hand, as you would in a post-process deduplication scenario. As I perused the Q&A I found that it is your intent to move away from back up to tape. Question 13: The master is the one that contains your Netbackup Database correct? Answer 13: Yes. Question 14: Are you using the Media Server to manage backups and restores of clients and the media server's local data to direct attached or SAN-attached storage (tape/disk)? Answer 14: Yes Question 15: So the SAN Media Server provides all the functionality of a Media Server without the ability to backup and restore data from remote clients. The SAN Media Server is designed for Client - any system that requires protection. The NetBackup client sends and receives data across the (LAN) to and from a NetBackup Master/Media Server. Since the master is the one that contains your Netbackup Database. So it needs lots of disk space and some power. It has the database that runs the schedules and keeps track of tape drives and other backup devices. It also keeps track of media servers correct? Answer 15: There is no SAN Media Server just Netbackup Master and Media servers.  Question 16: The media server (which a master can also be a media server) Currently is all backups being done on the tape library? Since the media server has the ability to talk to the clients and gets the data from them and put the info onto the backup device. It also has the ability to send data to the master server and info on the files that it is backing up so the master can add that info to the database. Does this have a direct attached (JBOD) for storage at the Master / Media Server? Or is all the data that's being backed up go straight to the tape library? Are you doing deduplication here at the (NetBackup Master/Media server utilizing Symantec V-Ray technology? Answer 16: Current backups are done on tape and disk (virtual tape library). The virtual tape library supports deduplication.   If the deduplication is being done at the NetBackup Master/Media server, it's for this reason also that if your environment contains a mix of disk and tape, post-process deduplication may be better suited to your purposes because there's less disruption to backup and archiving processes from a data deduplication method that carries out its work as a discrete stage rather than incorporating it with backups. But at the same time this method turns out to be absolutely ineffective if rapid data recovery is needed because when a client addresses storage, the system can be busy with deduplication of the next portion of data. Type of the data being processed also substantially influences the effectiveness of Post-Process Deduplication. Let's examine dedupe for a backup application making everyday shots of VM image. Obviously, there will be only a slight difference between such shots as they mostly contain OS and applications' files. The post-process dedupe will be able to figure out whether they are duplicates only when the shots are written to the storage, while in-line dedupe will determine redundancies before shots are stored to the backup. The more node-clients need to be processed, the less effective post-process dedupe appears to be, while in-line on the contrary shows increasing effectiveness. With the intentions of going away from a tape back up library it makes more sense to have a back up solution that does inline deduplication at the back up appliance with removal of duplicate data blocks before it is backed up. For that reason, data deduplication's key challenge is its processing overhead, especially in the case of large data sets. So in my best assessment, I think that the Inline Data Deduplication will be best for your back up approach. I found that The Symantec OpenStorage (OST) Technology API allows intelligent storage devices to interface to NetBackup Media Servers. Then we would provide a software plug-in which is installed on each NetBackup Media Server that is connected to the storage device. OST functionality is available on almost all our supported NetBackup Media Server platforms that we currently use today.  With regards to the NetBack Up Master/Media server, the SAN clients can be used with the deduplication option; however, as you know the deduplication must occur on the media server, not the client. We would configure the media server to be both a deduplication storage server (or load balancing server) and an FT media server. The SAN client backups are then sent over the SAN to the deduplication server/FT media server host. At that media server, the backup stream is deduplicated. I believe this is how the SAN client and NetBackup Deduplication are being done.   So the client is not enabled for deduplication on the SAN Clients. The data processing for deduplication is incompatible with the high-speed transport method of Fibre Transport. Client-side deduplication relies on two-way communication over the LAN with the media server. A SAN client streams the data to the FT media server at a high rate over the SAN where the deduplication is done on the media server before it hits the SAN. Question 17: Is this correct?  Answer 17: Yes.  Question 18: Is this what you are currently doing for back ups with NetBackUp?  Answer 18: Yes.  Question 19: Moving forward where will the Deduplication be done? On the Master/Media server (SAN) or will this all be done on the new back up solution?  Answer 19: backup solution.  This is where I would like to get some insight and feed back on where you want the deduplication to be done. Question 20: Are you wanting to have deduplication done at the backup storage device? Just wondering where and by which process they deduplication will be done at the Media Server or the new back up solution?  Answer 20: deduplication will be done on backup solution.   CLOSING DATE REMAINS UNCHANGED.  ****************************************************************  AMENDMENT 0003 EFFECTIVE 01/14/2015  THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO:  1.  TO INCORPORATE QUESTIONS ASKED AND ANSWERED AS FOLLOWS:  QUESTION 7: If there exists a NetBackup tape solution why is it necessary to provide additional hardware for a NetBackup Master/Media server on the RFI?

CORRECT THE ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH, THE ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER IS N66001-15-T-7415.  2.  TO INCORPORATE QUESTIONS ASKED AND ANSWERED AS FOLLOWS:  QUESTION 1.  When stating Dual Back Up Solution; does this mean a Dual Node Back up Appliance? Meaning 1 back up appliance in two locations each location having a Dual Back up appliance for no single point of failure at 1 site for each? or does Dual Back Up Solution mean, 1 back up solution at two different sites?  ANSWER 1. One backup solution in 2 different locations.  QUESTION 2.  With the initial specified requirement stating 76TB useable storage space upgradeable to at least 144TB with just the addition of disk storage; does this mean the requirement ask for a back up solution that includes the back up software license to cover 144TB storage initially with just the addition of "disk storage to 144TB" from 76TB useable storage space as the upgrade?  ANSWER 2. License only needs to cover initial storage provided, a minimum of 76TBs.  QUESTION 3.  When stating replication compression between back up storage arrays; does this mean that one back up solution will be a central repository and the second back up solution will be an offsite DR Back up?

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-91)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />Email: OPAP@uscg.mil<br />Fax: 202-372-8447<br />Phone: 202-475-5786<br /><br />More information about the Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/acquisition/business/ombudsman.asp<br /><br />Alternative Point of Contact: <br />Crystal Taber, Contracting Officer<br />USCG, ALC<br />Email: crystal.g.taber@uscg.mil<br />Fax: 252-334-5242<br />Phone: 252-335-6895</p>

<DESC>Sole source Long Term Contract (LTC) with Multiple Federal Groups - 28,30,53 - For OEM General Electric system(s).

A total of 33 NSNs are currently targeted for this contract effort. These items have been identified as sole source. However, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM.
<p>The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to General Electric at CAGEs 07482 &amp; 99207. The proposed items are intended for addition to existing sole source contract SPE4AX12D9422 under award to General Electric, CAGEs: 07482 &amp; 99207 (IAW FAR 6.302-1). This is a Requirements type Contract with seven (7) years remaining. The contract requires supply of parts as well as other functions including but not limited to inventory management, forecasting, distribution, storage, reliability improvements, engineering maintenance, and design (control) affecting these parts. Subcontracting opportunities do exist for this effort.</p>
<p>Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified OEM. This is proposed to be a FAR 15 effort.</p>
<p>A letter RFP will be issued to satisfy this action. The attached list of NSNs is the items for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by September 26, 2014 and should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and the SBA PCR Anne Mastrincola (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil).</p>
<p>Surplus dealers, small business dealers and distributors (having on-hand existing stock of surplus or newly manufactured material) are invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. In addition, respondents should identify quantity available and price. The government may procure material or alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The last decade has produced a remarkable transformation in the digital world. Enlistees being sworn-in the fall of 2014 were born in 1996; back then, service members and their families used a computer with a modem on a desk to connect to the Internet and their new electronic-mail accounts.</p>
<p>Today, more than 90 percent of U.S. adults own mobile phones, 65 percent have smartphones, and 74 percent participate in social networks. That includes today's modern military community, 85 percent of whom are 35 years old and younger - "militaryennials."<br />Because of these deep-seated and ongoing changes, strategies of outreach and engagement require fresh approaches to forge and maintain interactive connections with our entire military community - service members, their families and their survivors, the service providers and Command.</p>

Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to increase capacity of Interim Remedial Action Contract (RAC), W912WJ-14-D-0002.  Please note that this Notice of Intent was previously posted incorrectly citing FAR 6.302-2 as the authority.  All responses received within 10 days of this corrected notice will be considered by the government. <br>  <br> This increase in capacity is so that the contractor, Jacobs Engineering (Jacobs), can complete one additional dredge season while a new site specific RAC is finalized.

The additional capacity on the Interim RAC is required to ensure that dredging of contaminated sediment continues to occur in 2015.  <br>  <br> Contract No. W912WJ-14-D-0002 <br>  <br> Increase in capacity for Interim Remedial Action Contract. <br>  <br> The work will consist of approximately 125 days of dredging along with technical support, operation and maintenance of the dewatering and water treatment facilities for the Corps of Engineers New England District.   <br>  <br> All responsible sources may submit a response, which, if timely received, will be considered by the agency.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability of other qualified sources that can meet the requirements identified above.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice of intent.  <br>  <br> All responses received within 10 days of the posting of this notice, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  <br> Submit any inquiries within 10 days of the posting of the notice of intent via email: Jessica.R.Loc@usace.army.mil (list W912WJ-14-D-0002 in the subject line of the email) or mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: Jessica Loc, 696 Virginia Rd., Concord, MA 01742 <br>

Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) and (6) are of slightly less importance and are equal among themselves; Criterion (7) is the least important and will be used as a tie breaker among technically equal firms; and Criterion (8) will exclude a firm from further evaluation. Specific evaluation criteria include:

? Experience in providing post construction award services (shop drawing review, as-built drawing and Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) preparation, construction inspection services, and Operating and Maintenance Manuals).

Submission requirements: Provide up to five (5) projects completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years that best illustrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above. Example projects shall note project's square footage.

Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF330.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.

Submission requirements: Describe the firm's ability to concurrently perform and manage multiple projects in different locations to meet aggressive schedules, multiple disciplines, and control costs and the firm's capacity to accomplish multiple projects simultaneously. 

Criterion 4 - Past Performance - Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.

Requirement for Electronic Submission
Unless paper offers are specifically authorized, all responses to this pre-solicitation notice must be submitted electronically as described below.  The only acceptable paper form for this requirement is the receipt of past performance questionnaires.  Failure to comply with this requirement may jeopardize the possibility of receiving an award for the contract due to non-compliance with the terms of the solicitation.  You must submit your electronic offer, and any supplemental information (such as spreadsheets, backup data, technical information), using any of the electronic formats and media described below.

In addition, contractors are notified of the award via an electronic Notice of Award e-mail.  The award document will be attached to the Notice of Award e-mail. 

Acceptable Electronic Formats (Software) for Submission of Offers
1.	Files readable using the current Microsoft* Office version Products: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Access.  Spreadsheet documents must be sent in a format that includes all formulas, macro, and format information.  Print or scan images of spreadsheets are not acceptable.   Please see security note below for caution regarding use of macros. When submitting construction drawings contractors are required to submit one set in AutoCAD and one set in Adobe PDF.  (Purpose: contracting can open the PDF version and engineering can open AutoCAD files)

2.	Files in Adobe* PDF (Portable Document Format) Files:  When scanning documents scanner resolution should be set to 200 dots per inch, or greater.

3.	Other electronic format.   If you wish to submit an offer using another format than those described in these instructions, e-mail the Contracting Officer who issued the solicitation.  Please submit your request at least ten (10) calendar days before the scheduled closing date of the solicitation.   Request a decision as to the format acceptability and make sure you receive approval of the alternate format before using it to send your offer.

4.	Please note that we can no longer accept .zip files due to increasing security concerns.
E-mail Submission Procedures:  For simplicity in this guidance, all submissions in response to a solicitation will be referred to as offers.
a.	Subject Line:  Include the solicitation number, name of company, and closing 
date of solicitation.  Use only one of the terms Quotation, Offer, or Bid depending on the solicitation type. 
b.	Size:  Maximum size of the e-mail message shall not exceed five (5) megabytes.  Only one email is permitted unless otherwise stated in this paragraph or in writing by the Contract Officer submitting the solicitation.
The offer will be date and time stamped by the Microsoft Email system and will be the official record of receipt for the submission.

Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
1.	Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f), 52.214-7, and 52.215-1(c)(3).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission. 
 
2.	Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.
  
3.	To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as "unreadable" pursuant to FAR Parts 14.406 and FAR 15.207(c ). 

4.	The virus scanning software used by our e-mail systems cannot always distinguish a macro from a virus. Therefore, sending a macro embedded in an e-mail message or an e-mail attachment may cause the e-mail offer to be quarantined.   You may send both the spreadsheet and the spreadsheet saved in PDF format to ensure that your proposal is readable.

5.	Password protecting your offer is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated individuals.

Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veterans Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.  Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz at the time of proposal submission will result in the offeror's proposal being deemed non-compliant. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.
