<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New York officials, requires four (3) firm-fixed price requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Manhattan, Brooklyn, West Queens, East Queens and Long Island areas of the State of New York.  During the spring of 2004, APHIS anticipates applying control treatments to approximately 113,000 host trees with an estimated 1,400,000 diameter at breast height (dbh)  via trunk injection, estimated 23,000 host trees with an estimated 292,000 dbh via soil injection and 1,300 host trees with an estimated 5,200 dbh via soil drench total in all contract areas.  Control treatment applications are intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees.   ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza and London Plane.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture had declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  Requirements contracts will be awarded to ensure contractual coverage is in place in the event additional control treatment applications are required or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, or date of award, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period of each contract awarded.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about January 30, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer 3 weeks thereafter.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Telephone requests for a copy of the RFP will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>A -- Bioequivalence Studies of Inhaled Corticosteroids
<SOLNBR>223-04-3003
<RESPDATE>070504

<DESC>Establishing bioequivalence (BE) of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) requires a study design that is sensitive to dose differences.  Published dose-response and potency studies have utilized parallel designs for evaluation of ICS response because carryover between treatments prevented the use of crossover studies.  However, experience shows that for ICS, parallel designs generally lack sensitivity to distinguish differences in potency (i.e., shallow dose-response at the labeled dose and multiples thereof), and possess high variability.  Based on parallel design studies, the estimated sample size for documentation of BE is 1000 subjects or more.  At present, no validated BE methods with acceptable sensitivity and precision are available for ICS.  In 2001, Richard Ahrens, University of Iowa, (RC Ahrens, ME Teresi, S-H Han et al., “Asthma stability after oral prednisone: A clinical model for comparing inhaled steroid potency,” Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2001;164:1138-45) proposed a novel clinical model for determining relative potency of ICS using a crossover study design, in which the subjects serve as their own controls, thus increasing study power.  The study uses a wash-in of high dose steroid to equalize carryover between treatment periods, thus allowing a crossover design.  Based on pilot study data using the Ahrens’ model, the number of subjects needed for a BE study is estimated to be fewer than 100, an order of magnitude lower than the number needed in a parallel design.  The improved study power results in a study design that appears practical to establish BE.  FDA’s proposed Phase I contract will refine the study design published by Ahrens et al. in an effort to make the design suitable for establishment of bioequivalence.   The phase I study will consist of a randomized crossover dose-response study of three different doses of fluticasone propionate MDI, 44 mcg/actuation, in a four period study with duplication of one of the doses.  The proposed dose-response design, when applied to a BE study, is anticipated to involve three doses of reference listed drug (RLD), and at least one dose of test product, for a minimum of four study periods.  A lengthy, four period design will involve the potential for subject dropouts, changes in asthma status over time, concurrent upper respiratory tract infection, and increased steroid exposure.  In order to include these practical issues in the dose-response study, the RLD at the same dose that would be used for the test product in a BE study, is duplicated.  Inclusion of the replicated dose in the Phase 1 study will enable examination of intra-subject variability.  Each of the three doses will be from the same strength MDI.  The 44 mcg/actuation strength, rather than the 110 or 220 mcg/actuation strength, is chosen to enable characterization of dose-response in the rapidly rising region of the dose-response curve.  At least 24 asthmatic subjects will be enrolled and the study endpoints measured at scheduled times, including 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks following initiation of ICS will include raw spirometry outcomes and decrease in spirometry outcomes from maximal response.  Analysis of the Phase I results will attempt to address many of the following issues: (1) evaluation of whether a crossover rather than a parallel study design is adequate to obtain acceptable study power, (2) evaluation of intra-subject variability of the reference product and identification of acceptance limits for the phase 2 study, (3) an improved understanding of the dose-response in terms of optimal size doses to maximize study power and minimize the subject sample size, (4) improvement in the variance of spirometric measurements by conduct of critical study phases in a clinical center rather than in the home, (5) duration of each period of the randomized phase, 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks, and (6) inclusion criteria which may enrich the study population.  In order to assess the power of the study at earlier times of ICS dosing, study endpoints at 1 and 2 weeks will also be determined.  At completion of phase I, an optimal design which can be studied in phase II of the project, is anticipated. Phase II will apply the refined method to a bioequivalence study to confirm the utility of the method.  Phase II will be a crossover BE study to confirm the utility of the new method.  This research is anticipated to provide a method for conduct of a sensitive study to document the BE of a test product to the reference listed drug or precursor product.  Availability of the method may also be useful to assure bioequivalence of reformulated NDA products.  Although the study will use fluticasone propionate MDI as the model drug product, the study results are anticipated to be broadly applicable to the entire class of ICS.  A successful outcome of both Phases I and II of the project will enable the agency for the first time to be able to recommend a suitable BE method for ICS.  The BE method will be published in a draft guidance for industry.  It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement type contract will be made for a period of one and one-half_(1.5) years in September 2004. This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.

<SUBJECT>A -- Therapeutic Equivalence of Topical Products
<SOLNBR>223-04-3004
<RESPDATE>070504
<ARCHDATE>07202004
<CONTACT>Hamilton Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7043, Fax (301) 827-7101, Email hbrown@oc.fda.gov
<DESC>Despite considerable efforts by both the generic industry and the FDA for the past decade, few topical generic products are currently available on the US market. This is partly due to the unavailability of a cost-effective, scientifically sound system to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of topical products. For example, the bioequivalence demonstration of many topical products relies on clinical trials that may require hundreds of patients (due to high variability of the patient population). Even with large study sizes, these costly studies may have to be repeated to meet the confidence interval criteria to demonstrate bioequivalence. As part of a system to assess therapeutic equivalence of topical products without using clinical trials, in vivo tests that evaluate product performance are needed. Skin stripping techniques apply a topical product to the skin, remove the product after a specified time, and then remove the top layers of the skin and measure the amount of drug present in these layers. In FY2003 a preliminary study (phase I) was funded to improve the skin stripping procedure by mapping the sources of variability and quantification of variability in different stages of the method. There were two aspects to the phase I of the project: analysis of variability in various experimental strategies using existing data and methodology and a preliminary pilot experimental study. In this project (phase II), a pivotal study is planned to use the results of the first study to develop a new skin stripping methodology. There are four aspects to phase II of the project: 1. Use of the phase I results to define a protocol for the pivotal study, 2. Pivotal experimental study, 3. Mathematical simulation and modeling of absorption, distribution, metabolism and clearance from topical applications and 4. Development of a revised skin stripping protocol and methodology, for assessing the equivalence of topical formulations. The results of this project will evaluate the ability of an improved skin stripping procedure to differentiate between bio-availabilities of the test and reference products and measure, in vivo, the key physical properties that control the delivery of a drug from a topical drug product. This study will compare several test products to a reference product. The reference product will be a marketed product while the first test product will be a manufactured product provided by the FDA. The second test product will be a product that has been demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to the reference product.  The ability of skin stripping to measure alterations in skin partition and diffusion induced by formulation differences will be evaluated. Mathematical simulation, modeling and statistical analysis of the variability in various experimental strategies will be used to define an improved skin stripping methodology. This project will result in validation of an improved protocol and methodology that describes how to use the skin striping method to determine bio-equivalence of topical products. It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement type contract will be awarded for a period of two years in September 2004. A successful outcome of Phase II of the project will enable the agency to recommend a suitable bio-equivalence method for topical drug products.  The bio-equivalence method will be published in a draft-guidance for industry.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY. Request for Proposal will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement for providing 34 man-years of Contractor Engineering and Technical Support (CETS) to the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) for the operation, maintenance and support of their C4I Systems each year for up to three (3) years.  The requirement will be for highly-educated engineers and specialists, who have considerable experience in various aspects of present RSAF Command and Control hardware, software, and communications sub-systems, as well as Tactical Units equipment and systems that are also elements of the RSAF C4I System. The RSAF already have a direct commercial contract for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the RSAF C4I System.  This FMS requirement is for personnel who have considerable experience in the development, installation and deployment of C4I systems, and planning technology advancements to improve C4I capabilities so they can advise the RSAF in solving the most difficult and challenging problems beyond the expertise and abilities of the day-to-day technicians.

A total of six (6) of the positions will be located at the six (6) RSAF Command Centers in various regions of the country.  One of the positions is located to provide resident maintenance engineering assistance at the Tactical Unit Center (TUC).  Only contractors with proven experience providing this type of engineering and technical expertise in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be considered, since experience with Saudi Arabian labor laws and living conditions within the Kingdom is essential.  An additional requirement to provide a capability to annually procure within Saudi Arabia up to $4M of spares and repairs for C4I system and RPIE equipment and facilities is being considered for this project.  Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this synopsis.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to negotiate with the Cancer Institute, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, for the evaluation of techniques for the early detection and treatment of esophageal and gastric cancer.  Over 1,000 patients with dysplasia or early invasive cancer of the esophagus or gastric cardia will be required for this project.  The study will be conducted over a five year period.  The Government intends to award a fixed-price contract.  Most patients with these lesions are asymptomatic, so the subjects needed for this study will have to be identified from an asymptomatic high-risk population.  For this reason, the project will be carried out in the Linxian region of China, a geographic area with the HIGHEST RATES of esophageal and gastric cardia cancer IN THE WORLD.  The combination of an asymptomatic high-risk population and an experienced research team with proven successful activities similar to those needed in the current project makes the Cancer Institute, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences uniquely qualified to evaluate the early detection and treatment methods that will be evaluated.  No such study population exists in the United States, making competition infeasible.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Authority:  41 U.S.C.253 (c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB) of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the Biostatistics Branch (BB) of the Division of Cancer Etiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to negotiate with the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CICAMS) for a one year with four options to: (1) obtain updated endpoint data on the Nutrition Intervention Trials participants; (2) collect and store all available diagnostic materials for Nutrition Intervention Trials participants for new cancers diagnosed; (3) have a panel of clinical experts review and confirm all incident and mortal cancers and verify all causes of death; (4) continue storage of all existing blood samples collected during the Nutrition Intervention Trials in freezers at -85 degrees Centigrade, and provide a record of daily freezer and ambient temperatures in the freezer storage room for the duration of the new contract period; (5) with NCI develop a protocol and conduct a short-term nutrition supplementation study using varying doses and combinations of selenium and vitamin E to evaluate mechanisms relevant to carcinogenesis; (6) perform Case-Cohort/Nested Case-Control Studies of selected biochemical and genetic hypotheses.  The efforts from this contract will permit continued stuffy of trial participants to better understand the etiology of upper gastrointestinal cancer and strategies for prevention.  The Nutrition Intervention Trials are two double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized intervention studies conducted in Linxian to evaluate multiple vitamins/minerals in the prevention of esophageal and other cancers.  Beginning in 1985, the Dysplasia Trial evaluated 3,318 persons with cytologic evidence of dysplasia supplemented for six years while the General population Trial evaluated 29,584 persons supplemented for 5 ¼ years.  Biologic specimens were collected periodically throughout the trials and stored at CICAMS.  Post-prevention follow-up has continued since 1991.  Because the Nutrition Intervention Trials were conducted in China by CICAMS and the blood samples are in China at CICAMS, the continued follow-up must be conducted in China by CICAMS.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source because no study population exists in the United States.  Authority: 41 U.S.C.253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.30201.  See numbered note 22.  No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Shape Memory Alloy Power-Off Clamps. NASA LaRC is seeking to develop an articulated truss wing via telescoping truss elements that elongate and contract to allow for large wing shape changes.  To ensure structural stability during operation, the truss elements must be locked in place and then released for wing shape changes.	The most efficient method of accomplishiong this function is through the fabrication of a clamping device which will allow the telescoping parts to move with respect to each other when commanded with no power consumption.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Boeing Phantom Works Seattle, Washington.  Boeing Phantom Works is the only known source capable of developing the clamps.  Boeing has developed other functionally equivalent systems and has gained knowledge and experience under contract number NAS1-99069 for the development of the first generation of articulated truss wing structures.  The Sole Source Authority is FAR 6.302.1. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 11, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to establish a data and clinical coordinating center (DCC) to manage a registry of patients receiving a mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) to treat heart failure.  The registry will collect and analyze clinical and laboratory data and tissue samples from patients who are receiving MCSDs as destination therapy for end-stage heart failure at 60 to 70 participating hospitals.  It is anticipated that the registry will collect data, blood and tissue samples from approximately 2,000 new patients per year for a period of 5 years.  The program will be performed in two phases.  In Phase I (6 months), the DCC will develop a protocol, manual of operations, study forms and formats for web-based collection, and methods to insure accuracy of data submitted to the registry.  The manual of operations will include policies for publication, conflict of interest, privacy issues, data security and use of stored data.  During this phase, criteria to certify hospitals to participate in the program will be established and training plans will be developed for registry personnel.  In Phase II (4 years and 6 months), the DCC will provide overall coordination of the program.  Participating hospitals will be trained, certified and required to maintain established performance standards.  Eligible patients will be consented, enrolled and their data and samples collected.  The DCC will monitor study progress and assure data accuracy.  Each participating hospital will be site visited during this phase and additional site visits may be performed as needed.  Also, during this phase, the DCC will consider revision to the protocol and manual of operations as appropriate in response to new devices or changes in knowledge and treatment of heart failure patients.  In performing the work of the registry, the DCC will work closely with the following committees.  The Steering Committee will define enrollment, establish eligibility for detailed follow-up, determine a target number of patients for each device, finalize the protocol and provide scientific direction to the registry at an operational level.  The Steering Committee will consist of the Principal Investigator of the DCC, the Steering Committee Chairperson, staff members from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and representatives from the selected participating hospitals.  The Operations Committee is an executive committee of the Steering Committee with oversight and authority for the day to day operations of the study.  The Operations Committee will include the Principal Investigator of the DCC, the Steering Committee Chairperson, and representatives from the FDA and CMS.  The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed by the NHLBI and will be established to monitor overall progress, data outcomes and patient safety.  The DSMB will periodically evaluate procedures, findings, and adverse events and advise the NHLBI when changes should be made.
This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP).  It is anticipated that RFP-NHLBI-HV-05-08 for this program will be available on or about May 19, 2004 through the NHLBI Website at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and posted at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in RTP, North Carolina, with Research Triangle Institute (RTI) under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 for the development of a report on Particulate Matter (PM) on Flooring Due to Human Activity. The general objective of this pilot effort is to develop a fundamental understanding of generic mass PM re-suspension - specifically: (a) the source strengths for scenarios that produce significant indoor air concentrations due to human activity, and (b) its impact on translocation of PM throughout a residence. This work shall build on a previous EPA purchase order with RTI which involved developing generic particle mass/size methods to investigate particle resuspension due to human activity. The current work shall use these previously developed methods to investigate particle resuspension due to human activity in private residences with varied carpet ages and traffic patterns. In addition, testing will be performed to determine the transport of PM from room to room. 

EPA market research indicates that RTI is the only known supplier who can provide the required report since RTI previously developed dust resuspension characterization methodologies for PM on carpeting and the conditions of testing need to be identical to that of the preceding effort. Since these tests are a natural progression from previous work completed, it would take considerable time for a new contractor to become familiar with the work without incurring substantial cost in duplicating methodologies characterization. RTI is the only known source that can ensure consistency in methods and data generation between the previous work and the current work.

Since the original work was completed by RTI, and because of their unique familiarity with this project, they are the only known contractor capable of completing the requirements within the required time limitations. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such work. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before Monday, May 17, 2004 at 11:00 AM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 Parties should submit their technical documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2109, or 2.) by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing RFQ-OH-04-00090.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Public Health Foundation Enterprises (PHFE) Management Solutions, Inc, 13200 Crossroads Parkway North, Suite 135, City of Industry, CA 91746 to conduct the second phase of a community-based environmental survey for the presence of Legionella in building water systems after the switch from chlorine to monochloramine as the residual disinfectant. PHFE completed the first phase of the study and has exclusive rights to the sampling plan, data and analysis from that first  phase of this project. EPA believes that PHFE is the only vendor qualified of satisfying the requirements stated above because they are the only entity that possesses the information needed to complete the second phase of the study.  No other company has the water samples, sampling plan, data or  analysis from the community buildings before the water system switch from chlorine to monochloramine.  Since the building systems have already switched to the new water systems, it would be impossible for another company to recreate those samples and analysis.  The circumstance permitting "Other  than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The period of performance for the purchase order  is expected to be nine (9) months from date of award.  All interested parties who believe they can  provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Responses without the required documentation  will be considered nonresponsive.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Robin S. Harris (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703 or email to  harris.robin@epa.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE INITIATIVES FUND
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-CBX123
<CONTACT>Janice Washington, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-325-9625, Fax 703-325-7560, Email janice.washington@dtra.mil - Herbert Thompson, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-325-6627, Fax 703-325-9295, Email herbert.thompson@dtra.mil
<DESC>The Department of Defense's (DoD) Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) intends to award funds to Chemical Biological Defense projects across the range of military operations that fulfill identified capability needs associated with warfighting missions and in support of CB force protection. The total amount of funds available is $23M. However, the goal is to award multiple contracts (7-10). Contract Period of Performance is expected to be a maximum of 2 years from date of contract award.  The estimated BAA release date is 22 April 2004.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency – Chemical Biological (DTRA-CB) Directorate is requesting organizations (commercial, academic, non-profit, etc.) conducting advanced technology research and development in the chemical and biological defense arena to respond to the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Proposed technologies for this BAA should be sufficiently mature to achieve Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) 4-6 for non-medical efforts or TRLs 4-5 for medical efforts at the successful completion of the contracted work.  Non-medical efforts are not intended to be a proof of concept to determine whether separate components of a technology are viable, though it may validate a breadboard design, test the viability of a new application for a demonstrated technology through technology demonstrations, Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations, or a Joint Warfighter Experiment. The technology development should result in a demonstration of the component or system in a relevant environment.  For medical systems, a successful effort will, at a minimum, demonstrate a proof of concept of the proposed technology in an appropriate animal model or other relevant paradigm.  Clinical trials, phases 1-3, are beyond the technical maturity being considered under this BAA.

White papers/Quad charts and proposals should be limited to research and development that demonstrates quantifiable improvements in the following areas as: integrated early warning (early warning/standoff CB detection and standoff/remote surveillance/reconnaissance), installation/ force protection (BW agent identification and confirmation, next generation BW aerosol detection, force protection/installation decision support tools and sensitive equipment and interior decontamination), medical countermeasures (integrated diagnostic networks, CB warfare agent prophylaxis, and refractory nerve agent treatment) and individual/collective protection (prolonged filter shelf-life, Toxic Industrial Material filtration, defacto collective protection, selectively permeable materials, personal cooling systems, and improved closures for protective ensembles).

A two-phased proposal selection process will be employed for this solicitation. Phase I will consist of the solicitation, receipt and evaluation of a one-page Summary Quad Chart  and a White Paper described in the BAA. The White Paper shall include supporting information for data submitted in the summary Quad Chart and shall describe the capability gap addressed, provide a more detailed proposed technology, identify deliverables, describe work to be performed, describe the offeror’s expertise to effect the proposed solution, and present estimated costs and schedule. Phase II will consist of a solicitation of a full proposal resulting from favorable Quad Chart/White Paper evaluations. 

This solicitation will only be released and available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Accordingly, no written, telephonic, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpss.gov website for any solicitation amendments.  All questions concerning this requirement shall be addressed directly to the contractual point of contact at janice.washington@dtra.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Depot Jacksonville, Florida (DDJF) provides materiel distribution services including the receipt, storage and issuance of materiel. 

The Contractor shall provide the materiel distribution services performed at DDJF.  This includes all management, personnel and supervision in addition to materiel, tools, equipment and transportation, and any other items and services not government-furnished.  The DDJF depot consists of two sites, one located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville and one at Naval Station (NS) Mayport.  These sites are approximately 40 miles apart. At NAS Jacksonville, DDJF has warehouses and operations in the North area, South area, and inside NAVAIR Jacksonville satellites.  The North and South areas are approximately 3 miles apart.

The major commodities are airframe structural components for gas turbine and jet engines, bearings, fittings and specialties, non-powered valves, electronic assemblies, boards, cards, radioactive materiel, industrial/general supplies, repairables, aircraft engine fuel systems components, replacement parts for military equipment and aircraft engines. 

The Contractor shall be responsible for managing and operating the Materiel Processing Center (MPC) Operation for all assigned ships home-ported at Naval Station Mayport, FL and any additional assigned visiting ships to the local geographical area.  The MPC Operation is a customer focused distribution support operation that specializes in receiving and processing materiel that is to be stowed aboard ships.  This operation views each ship as containing floating warehouse(s) and work center(s) that requires the materiel to be moved from the MPC to shipside in a manner and configuration that reduces to the greatest extent possible the level of effort needed by the shipboard personnel to finish the stow action.  Materiel being delivered to a ship or diverted from one ship to another may be destined for the ship or a unit or squadron being deployed with the ship.  

The Defense Distribution Center is seeking offeror’s to perform the above functions on a best value basis. The solicitation is expected to be released on or about June 15, 2004. The resultant contract will be awarded on an all or none basis as a Time and Materials with Award Fee, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. The term of the contract consists of a two-year base period and three one-year option periods.   

The NAICS Code and Size Standard is 493110 and $21.5 million, respectively. A site visit and pre-proposal conference will be conducted at DDJF on June 2 and 3, 2004. The attached form must be completed FAXed at the numbers printed on the top of the form by May 27, 2004 at 3:00 p.m. EST. A video tape of the Distribution Standard System (DSS) will be presented in conjunction with the site visit/pre-proposal conference. Interested parties should contact Dennis Luquette by email at dennis.luquette@dla.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New York officials, requires four (3) firm-fixed price requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Manhattan, Brooklyn, West Queens, East Queens and Long Island areas of the State of New York.  During the spring of 2004, APHIS anticipates applying control treatments to approximately 113,000 host trees with an estimated 1,400,000 diameter at breast height (dbh)  via trunk injection, estimated 23,000 host trees with an estimated 292,000 dbh via soil injection and 1,300 host trees with an estimated 5,200 dbh via soil drench total in all contract areas.  Control treatment applications are intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees.   ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza and London Plane.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture had declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  Requirements contracts will be awarded to ensure contractual coverage is in place in the event additional control treatment applications are required or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, or date of award, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period of each contract awarded.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about January 30, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer 3 weeks thereafter.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Telephone requests for a copy of the RFP will not be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization - National Capital Region (DITCO-NCR) will issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of fiber to support the Global Information Grid - Bandwidth Expansion (GIG-BE) on or about 07 November 2003. The GIG-BE contract(s) will meet the current and future voice, video, data, and imagery transport needs of the Department of Defense (DOD) and its Services and Agencies. GIG-BE will supply the Warfighter with reliable and secure transmission facilities for today and tomorrow's voice, video, data, and imagery systems as required. The network will provide reliable and secure facilities to meet DOD requirements for command and control, intelligence, and support systems. This acquisition will provide for rapid expansion as required to effectively respond to the National Command Authorities, its components and select Federal agencies in peacetime, crisis situations, and wartime. The GIG-BE is being designed and sized to meet the DOD command and control voice, data, video, and imagery as requirements and mission needs dictate. A secret clearance (minimum) is required to receive, store, and generate, classified information pertaining to this acquisition. The actual planned site requirements are identified in a classified Annex to the Statement of Work. The National Industrial Security Program (NISP) and the 1995 NISP Operating Manual (NISPOM) incorporating change one, dated 1997, and change two, dated 2001 prescribes requirements, restrictions, and other safeguards that are necessary to prevent unauthorized disclosure of classified information and to control authorized disclosure of classified information released by U.S. Government Executive Branch Departments and Agencies to their contractors. The Manual also prescribes requirements, restrictions, and other safeguards that are necessary to protect special classes of classified information, including Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, intelligence sources and methods information, Sensitive Compartmented Information, and Special Access Program information. These procedures are applicable to licensees, grantees, and certificate holders to the extent legally and practically possible within the constraints of applicable law and the Code of Federal Regulations. Commercial entities that are in receipt of this government solicitation and wish to submit a competitive proposal to the government can obtain the associated classified information by providing a statement of compliance with the terms and conditions of the 1995 NISPOM with changes and the following terms of reference: Company Name: Address: Zip Code: CAGE Code: Defense Security Service (DSS) Cognizant Office (DCO). Company's Facility Security Clearance(s) (FLC). FCL Level of Clearance, Storage Level of Clearance, and any special consideration. Facility Security Officer (FSO) Name: Phone Number: Classified Mailing Address. It is the government's intent and desire for all companies to pick up the classified documentation vice having it mailed. Those companies providing their security information IAW the above terms of reference shall provide it via email to Mr. Gary L. Akin, at aking@ncr.disa.mil and Mr. Charles Fletcher, at fletchec@ncr.disa.mil no later than four working days prior to picking up the classified information. Mr. Akin and/or Mr. Fletcher will make arrangements and schedule a date and place for pick up upon receipt of the company's security information and the company’s “statement of compliance” with the NISPOM. Individual(s) picking up the classified information must present a proper courier card/letter issued by the DCO and photo identification for proof of identity. A company that is foreign owned and cleared under a Special Security Arrangement (SSA) and its cleared employees may only be afforded access to “proscribed information” with special authorization.  This special authorization must be manifested by a favorable national interest determination (NID) that must be program/project/contract-specific, thus a company operating under a current SSA doesn’t automatically afford them access to GIG-BE program information.  Access to proscribed information is predicated on compelling evidence that release of such information to a company cleared under the SSA arrangement advances the national security interest of the United States.  The Government anticipates a fixed price contract.  A single or multiple contracts may be awarded if it is in the Government's best interests. The unclassified RFP will be posted on or about 07 November 2003 on the World Wide Web at http://www.ditco.disa.mil under Contracting Opportunities on the DITCO Home Page. All inquiries regarding the GIG-BE RFP shall be submitted electronically and directed to Mr. Arthur S. Block, Contracting Officer, at blocka@ncr.disa.mil. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 517110 will be used for determining company size status.

<DESC>Recently, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) awarded two multiple year contracts to procure fiber optic infrastructure to help transform the Department of Defense's Global Information Grid (GIG). The contracts are firm fixed price with a potential value of roughly $250 million for implementation and $140 million for life cycle support.   FY-03 procurement funding will be used to acquire the fiber and year-to-year O&M funding will be used to sustain the fiber.  The GIG Bandwidth Expansion (BE) requirement was published in FebBizOps in March 2003.   (A public announcement of this award is posted on the DISA website at: http://www.disa.mil under Public Affairs, Press Releases, and GIG-BE Fiber Contracts awarded.) The awarded actions do not involve Foreign Military Sales. Although most of the geographic areas of this fiber solicitation were awarded, for multiple reasons, some were not.  Currently, the Government is reviewing the underlying requirements for the unawarded areas and intends to resolicit for some or all of these requirements in a timely manner.  A secret clearance (minimum) is required to receive, store, and generate, classified information pertaining to this acquisition. The actual planned site requirements are identified in a classified Annex to the Statement of Work. The potential new fiber optic contract awards will not involve Foreign Military Sales.  Background:  The initial procurements of fiber are part of the GIG-BE initiative and are in addition to contract awards for networking equipment.  The goal of the GIG-BE is to provide a survivable, secure infrastructure for the Department of Defense.

<CONTACT>Tina Phillips, Contract Specialist, Phone (610)595-0643, Fax (610)595-0671, Email marie.phillips@navy.mil
<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO CORRECT THE PRIMARY LOCATIONS OF THE WORK AS STATED IN THE TEXT AND EVALUATION FACTOR 7, SUBCONTRACTOR UTILIZATION, AND INCORPORATES ADDITIONAL SELECTION INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS.  
 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT STANDARD FORM 254 AND STANDARD FORM 255 IS CONTAINED HEREIN.
Engineering and design services are required for four indefinite quantity contracts for the preparation of architectural and engineering studies, plans, specifications, cost estimates and design-build Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for multi-discipline projects at various locations primarily in the states of DE, PA,  NY, NJ, MA, CT, RI, NH, ME, AND VT. 

One firm for each contract will be selected for the following contracts:  
Contract N62472-04-R-1430 will be used primarily for work in ME, NH and VT.  
Contract N62472-04-R-1431 will be used primarily for work in CT and RI.  
Contract N62472-04-R-1432 will be used primarily for work in NY and NJ.  
Contract N62472-04-R-1433 will be used primarily for work in PA, and DE.
However, work from other geographical areas may be added to any contract at the discretion of the Government. 

The preponderance of projects envisioned for these contracts are in the $1 - $8M range of estimated construction cost.  Project work may consist of, but is not limited to:  (a) new construction, renovations, alterations, change of use or repairs of office buildings, recreational and research facilities, etc., (b) general repairs of housing, barracks, window wall replacement, utilities, communications and electrical distribution systems, fire and intrusion detection and alarm systems,  (c) site work, oil water separators, etc.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command is moving towards Design-Build as the preferred method for acquiring capital improvements.  Though Design-Bid-Build methodologies (with the preparation of 100% Plans and Specifications) will continue to be utilized, a significant number will likely require preparation of Requests for Proposal packages for Design-Build solicitations using abbreviated (0% to 30%) design documentation.  Packages would include elements of site/engineering investigation, architectural programming, and functional/performance specifications.

The following services may also be required: facility planning which includes project programming documents, development of requirements, preparation of engineering evaluations, project scope, and unit guidance or parametric cost estimating, development of alternatives and economic analysis; analysis of proposed sites for foundations, utilities, access, constraints and identification of environmental issues; facility design/construction packages, sustainable design analysis and project implementation, design-build Request for Proposal packages, government collateral equipment lists, project preliminary hazard analysis, obtaining permits and regulatory approvals, comprehensive interior design, review of the contractor’s submittals, field consultation and inspection during construction, Title II Inspection, Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), and as-built drawing preparation.  The initial project for each contract will be determined at a later date.  Projects assigned to these contracts may include work in the following specialties:  Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Architectural, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture.  

Phases and/or pre-priced contract options may be included and will be exercised at the discretion of the government for 0 to 35%, 35 to 100% design, and post construction contract award services.  Contract award is contingent on availability of funds.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  Some projects will require design in the metric system.  

As part of each contract, an asbestos and/or lead-based paint assessment may be required to determine the presence of hazardous material during removals/demolition or at utility points of connections.  Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead paint, PCB’s, and other hazardous materials.  

Work will be prepared utilizing AutoCAD 2000 or higher.  Specifications will be prepared using SPECINSTACT  program, and cost estimates using the Success estimating program in a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) system format will be utilized. Selected firm will be required to provide documents in pdf format for posting to a Government web site during solicitation.

Firms are advised that the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents, facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or request for proposals for Design-Build projects, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost. 

The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to email via the Internet for exchange of correspondence/information.

6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years (extension optional) 
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	Program Description

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia has responsibility for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics.  This program is directed at supporting a program of policy reform, economic recovery, democratic and social transition in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Within the USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia the Office of Health and Education (HE) has the primary responsibility for management of assistance in the social sectors, primarily health reform, prevention and control of infectious diseases, maternal and child health and reproductive health (MCH/RH), humanitarian and disaster assistance.  USAID/HE serves as the primary point of communication on these sectors with the governments of the five Central Asian Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan); five U.S. Embassies in Central Asia; non-governmental organizations (indigenous, U. S., international); other donors and private commercial entities. USAID is funding activities in public health care reform (which includes health financing and systems reform); infectious disease prevention and control (TB, HIV/AIDS, and malaria); reproductive health and maternal and child health; and US health partnerships.  The governments of Central Asian Republics, especially Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are receiving USAID assistance in developing more effective health systems and policies.  

USAID/CAR’s strategic objective in health is: Increased utilization of quality primary health care in selected populations.  This objective is achieved through four intermediate results: (1) select populations are better informed about personal health care rights and responsibilities; (2) improved quality of health care including infectious diseases and maternal and child health; (3) improved use of health care resources for primary health care and (4) improved legislative, regulatory and policy framework. 

A major challenge in the region is to a) restructure the public health sector to focus on primary health care; b) strengthen the role of the private sector in providing health services as the public sector can no longer provide all health services to all the people, as was done under the Soviet system; b) reduce the burden of disease caused by infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, acute respiratory infection, diarrheal diseases, hepatitis, etc.  In addition, these countries have high mortality and morbidity caused by diseases such as cardiovascular, cancer and other lifestyle related diseases which are observed in more developed countries.  

B)	STATEMENT OF DUTIES

OBJECTIVE

Under the general supervision of the Office Director, Office of Health and Education, the Contractor will serve as USAID/CAR’s Regional Public Health Management Specialist for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.  The Contractor will provide USAID/CAR with technical and analytical support in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the health activities that will strengthen the capacity of the CAR governments and non-government organizations (NGOs) to develop and sustain effective health policies, systems and effective, efficient quality service delivery.

The Contractor will play an active role as a team member of the Strategic Objective (S.O.) 3.2 Team.

<DESC>The Alaska VA Healthcare System and Regional Office (AVAHSRO) is seeking professional design services from an A/E firm within a 50 mile radius of Anchorage, AK, to develop schematic design, design development, working drawings and specifications to use for construction, including construction period services after construction contract award for an Upgrade to the Homeless Veterans Service building to a Seismic Zone 3 rating.   An engineering study of the single story building has determined the following items need to be upgraded to bring the building up to current codes.  The findings include: (a) the number of lines of shear walls is sufficient in the north-south and east-west directions; (b) due to the irregular building footprint, several re-entrant corners in the roof diaphragm have insufficient tensile strength to resist the seismic design forces expected at the site; (c) the existing wood diaphragm has insufficient strength to resist the seismic design forces expected at the site; (d) openings in the roof diaphragm at the interior courtyard greatly reduce the diaphragm’s ability to transfer load to the walls; (e) the existing connection between the roof diaphragm and the walls is inadequate for in-plane seismic forces; (f) the existing connection between the walls and the foundation is inadequate; and (g) the existing wood shear walls have insufficient shear strength to resist the seismic design forces expected at the site.  Design will include compliance with all applicable building codes and VA Design standards.  All construction drawings shall be provided on AutoCAD 2005 and specifications in MS Word 2000.  The NAICS Code is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4.0 million.  Numbered Notes 1 and 24 apply.  The construction cost estimate is between $2.0 million and $5.0 million.  Award will be made to the A/E judged by the VA to be the best qualified for this type of work.  The following factors also apply: (1) evaluation of the knowledge of healthcare facilities and prior successful experience designing project of the same/similar nature, size and cost; (2) reputation and standing of firm and principal officers with respect to professional performance, general management and cooperativeness; (3) record of significant claims against client because of improper or incomplete A/E services; and (4) past performance and capability of meeting schedules and mobilizing.  Firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit two (2) copies of their SF 254 and SF 255s, along with a copy of their representations and certifications, to AVAHSRO, Attn: Sandra Magers (90C), 2925 DeBarr Road, Anchorage, AK 99506, no later than 4:00 pm (AST) on June 1, 2004, with a cover letter of interest identifying RFP 463-0059-04.

VA is in the later third year of a 5-year lease.  Lease Group has offered to replace the current contract with a 3-year lease on July 1, 2004.  The buy-out price of an early termination is $73,428.79.  There would be additional shipping fees if VA decides to terminate for convenience.  Any other offers received would have those costs to the Government added to their price proposal.  The proposed 3-year lease is financially advantageous to the Government.  VA will consider other offers if they can be more financially advantageous.  All other offers must be able to clearly demonstrate their ability to maintain the equipment.  Roseburg is in a very small community, halfway between Medford and Eugene, Oregon.  Interested parties can e-mail Sue.Tullier@med.va.gov for additional information.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to augment their existing pool of technical and analytical services contractors for FY05.  Both current vendors and new vendors will be provided with the opportunity to participate in the Command’s Commercial Enterprise Omnibus support services (CEOss) business model, established in August 2002.   To date, $180+ million in task order awards have been accomplished ranging from $150K to $6 million.  CEOss is predicated upon Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.404(b)(4), which authorizes agencies to issue Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with Federal Supply Service (FSS) contractors.  Twenty-seven competitively awarded BPAs have been established with contractors using approved FSS schedules aligned along four (4) competency-based domains.  CEOss Open Season allows current prime contractors to reconstitute their existing teams to respond to anticipated Command requirements.  Additionally,  CEOss intends to make three (3) new prime vendor awards – one (1) award in the ES domain; one award in the BA domain; and one (1) award in the ALA domain.  Openings in the ES and BA domains are unrestricted as to business size.  The ALA domain opening is restricted to firms classified as a small business.  A preparatory workshop will be held, by domain, for only potential new CEOss prime vendors during the week of 24 May 2004, to provide detailed information about specific submission requirements.  Vendors are required to register for this workshop by submitting an email to the ACSS mailbox (acss@mcsc.usmc.mil) NLT 15 May 2004.  Attendance is limited to two (2) representatives per company and attendance may be restricted due to space constraints. 

CEOss Background Information:  The CEOss model relies exclusively on paperless, e-commerce transactional processes to compete all requirements among qualified domain prime vendors.  Individual Task Orders are competitively awarded to BPA contractors within these respective domains.   There is no maximum dollar limit on any task order, nor any minimum order amount assigned to the BPAs.  There are four (4) domains within the CEOss model:  Specialty Engineering, Business and Analytical, Engineering and Scientific, and Acquisition, Logistics and Administrative.  Vendors are required to identify the domain for which they would like to be considered for a prime BPA and only one submission per vendor is allowed.  To qualify for consideration for the Specialty Engineering domain, vendors must have one of the following GSA schedules:  874 – MOBIS, 871 – Engineering Services, 899 – Environmental Services, 70- IT Services and Support, 873 – Lab Testing and Analysis.  To qualify for consideration for the Business and Analytical domain, vendors must have one of the following GSA Schedules:  874 – MOBIS, 872 – Financial Management Services, 69 – Training Services.  Although vendors may receive a prime BPA award in only one of the four domains, teaming and subcontracting relationships within the domains are unrestricted.

Instructions for new CEOss applicants:  To be considered for a CEOss prime BPA, interested vendors should submit the following information NLT 14 June 2004:   A capabilities statement, limited to five (5) pages that identifies their firm’s capabilities within a domain of prime interest (ES, BA or ALA);   a copy of their applicable GSA Schedule; and any general marketing information.  All material should be submitted on one (1) CD-ROM along with one (1) hard copy.  Only small businesses will be considered for the ALA Domain opening.  All business sizes will be considered for the ES and BA Domain openings.
Vendor information will be matched to domain (i.e., Command) requirements to establish a baseline that considers both pricing and technical capabilities within the domain.  Vendors determined to offer the best "fit" within each domain, respective of price and services offered will have the opportunity to respond to a formal solicitation NLT 12 July 2004.  Responses will be due within fifteen (15) business days following release on 2 August 2004. Competitive selection and award of BPAs is anticipated to occur NLT 23 August 2004.  
Currently, there is no formal requirement and this is only a Request for Information.

<DESC>The Office of the Program Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) desires information on Course Correcting Fuze (CCF) concepts for the Army’s Precision Area Fires - Initiative (PAF-I) for all calibers of cannon artillery projectiles.  CCF refers to course correcting modules compliant with NATO  standard fuze form factor.  The CCF solution will replace standard fuzes to improve the accuracy and thus effectiveness of conventional artillery  munitions.   The respondent should provide a Technology Development (TD) program that can demonstrate and produce 1000 units as soon as possible for operational use. The respondent may require waivers to envisioned military requirements for MOFA fuze functions, -45 to +145 F operational, -60 to + 160 F storage, Global positioning System (GPS) Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM), Anti-Jam (A/J) and 20 year storage.  The respondent should take advantage to the maximum extent practicable the use of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components to correct the ballistic path of US Army stockpile projectiles to approximately fifty meter (50m) Circular Error Probability (CEP) at all ranges. The proposed solution should be initiated or settable with Enhanced Portable Inductive Fuze Setter (EPIAFS) prior to projectile firing and be compatible with 105mm and 155mm US Army howitzers. Respondents should propose risk mitigation tasks to be executed in parallel with the TD.  Risk mitigation tasks shall focus on meeting Military requirements to reduce the risk for MS B and start of System Development &  Demonstration (SDD). In addition, the respondent should propose a follow on SDD solution that meets  envisioned military requirements for both 105mm and 155mm US Army artillery howitzers and ammunition.  Respondents should include information in the areas  such as; operational procedures; estimate delivery accuracy as a function of range; and discuss technical challenges including proposed packaging with space claims for all required fuze components.  It is required that any CCF information will not significantly impact standard operational procedures, materially impact maximum range nor degrade projectile lethality.  Respondents  should provide a Unit Cost Model based upon production quantities of 50,000,  100,000 and 500,000.  The Government will not facilitize prospective offerors.  Any information should be based on self facilitization.  All information should include a  capabilities statementand be submitted by Electronic Commerce (EC) to rhill@pica.army.mil.  Responses are due within 14 days.  This notice is for  informational purposes only and no solicitation will be issued as a result of  this market survey. See Numbered Note 25.

<SUBJECT>D -- Sole Source Synopsis for Step508 Tool
<DESC>The Step508 Tool is a new electronic technical solution focused on providing website error prioritization for Section 508 compliance.  This tool prioritizes the repairs that should be made to a website to ensure that the site is compliant with the accessibility requirements of Section 508 that provides access to information technology for persons with disabilities.  The Step508 Tool was developed as a partial solution to help the Federal government to create an operating and management environment that meets legislated requirements and enables all citizens access to information, programs, services and employment.  The tool is also designed to provide metrics that report progress in improving the accessibility of a site over time.


GSA proposes to award a sole source contract to National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM), the original developer of the Step508 software, to enhance the capabilities and functionalities of the software. Enhancements to the Step508 tool includes: additional output pages; develop a generalized input format (XML/DTD) or schema; develop reporting metrics on statistical methods for gathering and including data from manual checks for prioritization analysis; and development of a reparability value adjustment interface to allow users to modify values of errors in order to accommodate changes in technology. GSA believes that only NCAM possesses the required capability and technical expertise to perform this requirement.  Any other firm desiring consideration must fully identify its capability to perform this requirement within the required timeframe and allotted budget. GSA plans to make a sole source award to NCAM after fifteen (15 days) of the publication of this notice.  Please note that this announcement is not a Request for Proposal and no solicitation will be issued as a result.

<DESC>THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate and issue a sole source modification to extend Contract N00019-99-D-1063 for a 6-month period and two three 3-month option periods pursuant to FAR Par 6.302-1.  The contract modification is required to sustain continuous commercial air services in support of U.S. Navy programs in the Naples, Italy operating area until the competitive follow-on procurement can be awarded. The current contract expires 30 September 2004, and the modification will extend the period of performance to 30 March 2005, with two (2) three month options. The current contractor, Flight International, Inc., is the only source available to provide the required services for a six-month period, due to extensive day-to-day contact between the government, fleet schedulers, and contractor personnel, required aircraft and equipment, and short time frame of performance for which these critical readiness training services are required.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 488190 Other Support Activities for Air Transportation with a size standard of $6M. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal.

<SUBJECT>99 -- WAIVER OF THE NONMANUFACTURER RULE
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO WAIVE THE NONMANUFACTURER RULE FOR VARIOUS ALUMINUM SHEET METAL.
The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Various Aluminum Sheet Metal. The basis for the waivers is that no small business manufacturers are supplying these classes of products to the Federal government.  The effect of a waiver would be to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.
Comments and sources must be submitted on or before May 14, 2004.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 205-7280; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act, (Act)15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product.  This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR 121.1204, in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding systems.  The first coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal Procurement Data System.  The SBA received a request on April 16, 2004 to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Various Aluminum Sheet Metal.  In response, SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Various Aluminum Sheet Metal, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 331315.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule for this NAICS code. 
AUTHORITY:  15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17).

<DESC>Qualification Statements from all business concerns will be accepted for the Pennsylvania Reconstruction Project Number UDSP 1104(099)

The project is located in Washington, DC just north of the White House.  The limits of work include Pennsylvania Avenue between 15th and 17th Streets, NW and Jackson and Madison Place between Pennsylvania Avenue and H Street.   The project consists of grading, drainage, utility relocation, street light installation, traffic signals, pavement reconstruction, sidewalk construction, site security, site furnishings, and landscaping.  Most of the project site will be closed to the public for the duration of construction.  Limited pedestrian access will be required to the surrounding buildings.

Utility work will consist of relocating existing electrical, telecommunication, water, sewer, and natural gas facilities where conflicts occur.  Also included will be the installation of a new water main, new telecommunication conduit, and new street light system.  Three hundred feet of existing combined sanitary/storm sewer will also be lined.

Pavement reconstruction includes removing the existing pavement structure on Pennsylvania Avenue and constructing granite pavement and hot synthetic asphalt concrete pavement.  The granite pavement consists of 2-foot by 5-foot pavers on a reinforced Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) base.  The hot synthetic asphalt concrete pavement consists of a clear synthetic binder mixed with an architectural aggregate placed on a reinforced PCC base.  New granite and brick sidewalks will be constructed along the entire length of the Avenue.  The granite sidewalks will consist of 4-foot by 10-foot granite pavers on a reinforced PCC base.

Site security consists of constructing bollards, retractable bollards, and guard booths at the four entrances to the project site.  The guard booths are constructed out of granite, cast iron, and ballistic glazing and include lead coated copper roof, granite floor, under vehicle surveillance systems, geothermal heating and cooling units, stainless steel cabinetry, and other security items.

Site furnishings consist of granite benches and information kiosks.  Landscaping consists of planting Government furnished 5½ inch-6 inch caliper American Elms, excavating and placing structural soils in and around the tree boxes, and planting groundcover.     

The project is expected to fall within the price range of $15,000,000 to $20,000,000.  The project is subject to the availability of funds.

Award will be made to an offeror whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of the technical qualifications and price that offers the best value to the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for the following commercial items:

SCHEDULE OF ITEMS:
Contractor needs to provide a unit price for each of the following line item with a total amount for all:
01:	Basic Software license,
02:	Additional licenses,
03:	Training at Vendor Site,
04:	Training at Customer Site (Salt Lake City, UT),
05:	Consultation Services (hourly rate),
06:	Annual Software Maintenance,

    OVERVIEW:
The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Geospatial Service & Technology Center (GSTC), requires commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) spatial Extract, Translate, Load (ETL) software to support production and data-sharing processes.

    SCOPE OF WORK:
Data Format Conversion Requirements-
The software will be used to integrate geospatial vector data from a variety of sources into GSTC’s map production processes.  The primary target formats are ArcInfo coverage and ArcSDE/Oracle.  The source formats will include all commonly-used geospatial vector formats, including (but not limited to): ESRI ArcInfo coverage, ESRI shapefile, ERSI geodatabase, MicroStation Design, AutoCad DWG/DXF, USGS DLG, TIGER, and SDTS.  To complete the value-added data-sharing cycle, the software will also be used to translate revised production data back to the source format/schema.

Attribute/Schema Conversion Requirements-
The software will support attribute and data structure manipulation where source schemas are converted to target production schemas.  All modifications required for a given source dataset should generally be achieved through a single batch process.  Data format conversions (such as MicroStation DGN to ArcInfo coverage) should take place simultaneously with attribute mapping processes (at least is a virtual sense).  The software should include a rich set of data conversion tools to mitigate the risk of yet to be discovered data conversion problems.  Examples of known tasks:
•	Simple attribute mapping where only the names of the source and target attributes differ while values remain unchanged (i.e. Surface Type/Gravel maps to Material/Gravel).
•	Data type conversion where the source and target data types differ but the value remains unchanged (i.e. integer/999 becomes character/999).
•	Logic or Boolean-driven attribute mapping where the nature of the attribute mapping is conditional upon the value of a specified attribute.  This functionality should also support multi-level decision logic (If, Then, Else).
•	Lookup Table-driven attribute mapping.
•	Concatenation of multiple source attribute values (where the number of valid source values per record is variable) to a single target attribute value string (with or without user-defined delimiters).
•	Attribute parsing where a single source attribute is divided and mapped to multiple target attributes.
•	Data reorganization where, for example, a single source dataset is divided into multiple thematic datasets.
•	Expression-driven attribute mapping where two or more source attributes are mapped to a single target attribute according to standard programming operators (source attribute values 3 and 5 in the same record are multiplied and mapped to target attribute value 15).
•	Attribute/schema conversion of ArcInfo coverage route, polygon, region, and annotation feature classes where coverage topology must be maintained.  Multiple feature attribute tables may require schema conversion/attribute mapping.  These may include: arc attribute table (AAT), polygon attribute table (PAT), route attribute table (RAT<route>), region subclass attribute table (PAT<region>), and text attribute table (TAT<anno>).

Additional Software Requirements-
•	The software should employ an industry-standard graphical user interface (GUI).
•	The software should include a scripting language and tools to support batch processing as well as methods of customization.
•	The software should include detailed, well-organized online documentation designed according to current industry standards.

<DESC>QUESTION: 
Do you require MOC (Microsoft Official Curriculum Courseware) for the listed classes or is other courseware acceptable?


ANSWER:
It must be MOC (Microsoft Official Curriculum Courseware).


QUESTION:
I calculate a Total of 84 students taking the three courses.  
Class 2274 - 2 classes x 12 students = 24 students
Class 2275 - 2 classes x 12 students = 24 students
Class 2276- 3 classes x 12 students = 36 students
 
Will each student require TWO Testing Vouchers for the Microsoft Exams (70-290 & 70-291) and could you please confirm the total number of testing vouchers required.


ANSWER:
The 24 students taking course 2274, 2275 and 2276 are the same 24 students, so we’ll need 24 test vouchers for exam 70-290.  The additional 12 students taking course 2276 will also require test vouchers, so we’ll need a total of 36 vouchers for exam 70-291.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Title: “Identification of early Cochlear Biochemical Changes Associated with Acoustic Over Exposure Using Cochlear Micro Dialysis”  
INTRODUCTION: The Department of Defense Spatial Orientation Center of Naval Medical Center, San Diego staff conducts ongoing projects in auditory and vestibular research.
ABREVIATIONS:  DOD = Department of Defense, ONR = Office of Naval Research, NMCSD = Naval Medical Center San Diego, BU = Baylor University, GPOC = Government Point of Contact, DSOC = DOD Spatial Orientation Center, ROM = reactive oxygen molecules, FR = free radicals, SPL = sound pressure level, mL = micro liter, kHz = kilohertz, HPLC = High Pressure Liquid Chromatography, COL = Colonel, MC = Medical Corp, FY = Fiscal Year
SCOPE: Contractor will conduct research into cochlear biochemical responses to intense noise exposures in support of funded investigations under the ONR Military Operational Medicine program. This program encompasses research into developing countermeasures for the prevention of tissue/organ damage prior to exposures to high-energy sources (loud sounds) and to develop methods for rescue and treatment after exposure to exotic energy sources. This work entails performing a series of experiments for two years to: (1) understand the cochlear intracellular biochemical response to damaging sound energy, (2) to identify and delineate the reactions involved with glutathione metabolism and reactive oxygen molecules (ROM) and free radicals (FR) produced by oxidative stress in response to acoustic over-exposure, and (3) utilize our recent antioxidant technology to increase hair cell glutathione or antioxidant defenses to reduce the formation of and damage caused by FRs and ROM molecules in order to prevent hair cell damage or death caused by traumatic noise. 	The first year encompasses three experiments (A, B and C). Experiment A involves studying groups of chinchillas under no noise conditions to characterize baseline biochemical and metabolic responses of the auditory hair cells.  Experiment B entails exposing the same number of animals, first to one hour of no noise for baseline measurements and then for four hours of continuous noise at 105 dB SPL octave band noise centered at 4 kHz.  In Experiment C animals will again undergo one hour of baseline measures (no noise) then be noise-exposed for four hours but prior to noise exposure a glutamate antagonist will be administered to study its capability to reduce perilymphatic glutamate levels and counteract excitotoxicity. The treatment animals will be compared to saline injected noise-exposed animals, which will serve as controls.  In each experiment cochlear perilymph fluid will be sampled using micro dialysis technology.  Perilymphatic samples are taken at a rate of 1mL per minute giving three 20 mL specimens per hour. As control reference for perilymphatic metabolism and to also monitor the stress level of the whole animal, a sample of brain and blood plasma will be taken and measured for the same metabolites.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

All experiments, the contractor will receive shipments of frozen blood plasma, brain tissue and perilymphatic samples as collected by micro dialysis sampling.  After careful calibration of equipment, quantification of the following metabolites: glutamate, cysteine, reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione, malendialdehyde and dihydroxybenzoate will be measured from each perilymphatic aliquot and from each brain and plasma specimen.  
The contractor will assess the biochemical events taking place in the cochlea during quiet conditions and then following damaging sound exposure utilizing high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).  This study will elucidate the cellular biochemical response of hair cells to noise-induced damage and investigate the capability of glutathione enhancing and mitochrondrial protectants to prevent noise-induced cell death (apoptosis).  The brain tissue and blood plasma samples will be used for controls and to determine the effect of the noise stress on the state of the animal.
