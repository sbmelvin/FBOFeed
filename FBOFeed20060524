<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR (DOI), MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length for specific topics of interest to the MMS Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER). For your information, the MMS web site has descriptions of OSER activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects. The web site address is: http://www.mms.gov/tarphome/index.htm.  BACKGROUND:  Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee the orderly development of offshore oil and gas operations. New challenges and informational needs arise as companies use new equipment or procedures based on technological changes or as operations expand into new or different environments such as the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).   The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2007 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of approximately $ 1,000,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSER topics in FY 2007 with projects being identified through this announcement. NOTICE: MMS may share the white papers with other federal government employees for review. Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the Papers/proposals shared.  OBJECTIVES:  The topics for the FY 2007 OSER activities include ONLY research on the following: 1. Provide best practices guideline and assess well completion options and methodologies for high pressure/high temperature/ and sour (H2S) wells. 2. Evaluate the fatigue life of risers and floating structures and review the fatigue modeling process and begin to write a replacement standard. 3. Initiate a joint industry project to develop and test an on-line integrity monitoring system for offshore platform structures.  The system would minimize dive inspections, improve safety, and assist in returning a platform back to production quicker. This joint industry project could be tested by monitoring 10 - 20 platforms for 3 - 5 years. 4.  Conduct a technology assessment for Outer Continental Shelf, Oil and Gas Operations in the Cold Regions to determine what may be technically feasible -- given both ice-challenges, and also open water with large fetches and waves. 5.  Evaluate superstructure icing of the both drilling and production vessels and platforms as it relates to conducting activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. 6.  Assess the design options for pipelines and provide a risk analysis for strudel scour, upheaval buckling and ice gouging in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. 7. Assess methods for using a sub sea instrumentation cable to evaluate technology for use in the Arctic ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to safety and pollution practices for offshore operations.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: The United States Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Office (ORO), plans to contract by means other than full and open competition.  ORO intends to negotiate an extension to the current Contract Number DE-AC05-00OR22690 with Wackenhut Services, Inc., for physical protection of Government assets through its paramilitary protective force and continue to provide information security and personnel security.  Major sites include the DOE Federal Building complex, East Tennessee Technology Park, Office of Scientific and Technical Information, the Office of Secure Transportation, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This action is to extend for up to three months a contract which has been in place since October 1, 1999, and is currently set to expire on June 30, 2006. The extension modification will be for one month with two consecutive one-month options.  The estimated value of this contract extension is approximately $8.6 million, based on approximately $2.8 million for each month, for each of the three months, July, August, and September. An open competitive solicitation for award of a contract for a source to provide a paramilitary protective force and personnel security, but not the information security portion of this contract, is expected to be awarded in June or July of this year. The use of other than full and open competition for the proposed action is authorized by 41 USC 253(c)2.  This section provides that when the agencyâ€™s need for the supplies or services is of such unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.  Delay in award of a contract action would result in serious injury, financial and otherwise, to the Government; thus an unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates your firmâ€™s ability to provide an equivalent service and rationale as to why they should be considered, as described above.  All interested firms must respond by 2:00 PM (EST), June 8, 2006, to Walker Love, AD-424, U.S. Department of Energy, 200 Administration Road, Oak Ridge, TN  37830.  Email:. lovewk@oro.doe.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No reimbursement for any costs connected with providing the capability information will be provided by DOE.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Scimedia USA Ltd, Irvine, CA 92614,  pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This purchase is for one (1) each of the following items: 1) MiCAM02 Dual Camera System (includes two CCD cameras, processor, PC, LCD monitor, interface card, software for acquisition and analysis, cables, and manuals); 2) THT Microscope (includes lenses, filters for VSD imaging, and stand and stage configuration); and 3) HL-150 includes 150 watt halogen light source with built-in shutter, shutter controller, fiber optic light guide and condenser lens.  System must be capable of visualizing seizure propagation in hippocampal slices with use of voltage sensitivefluorescent dyes, the critical technical requirement is a high speed, high resolution, extremely sensitive and stable camera system that may detect fluorescent change of less than 0.1% at a very high speed (>200 frame per second), since the frequency of neuronal seizure activities is greater than 100 Hz.  The MiCAM02 system has achieved the highest signal-to-noise ratio among CCD cameras, it can image 192x128 pixels at 270 frames per second with MiCAM02 HR and 555 fps with MiCAM02 HS.  In addition this is a two camera system, and therefore the background image and the pseudocolor image in the same acquisition, so pixel positions are perfectly aligned and analysis can be done immediately after recording is finished.  Any firm believing itself capable of providing these services may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Dee Lunney at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Scimedia USA Ltd.  The NAICS Code/Size is 334516/500EM.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold of $100,000.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.*****

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA has a need to address training for pilots flying transport category aircraft to enhance their recognition of conditions that might lead to in-flight upsets and to facilitate the appropriate handling of those upsets should they occur.  The FAA is surveying the marketplace to see the extent of interest and capability in meeting these requirements.  Upset events may lead to loss-of control incidents and accidents, and the respondent should demonstrate how this training affords pilots an increased likelihood of successfully recognizing and coping with an upset thereby avoiding an incident or accident.  The training and testing in an in-flight simulator should help identify critical pilot training factors. In its submission, the respondent should demonstrate experience in addressing human factors issues related to the acquisition, transfer, and retention of pilot skills from ground-based simulators to in-flight simulator performance.  They should have at least ten years of proven experience to train and test pilots using in-flight simulation.  They should have a demonstrated history of safe in-flight simulator training.  The in- flight simulator must be an actual aircraft that has the capability to change its flight characteristics to emulate a transport category aircraft.  This in-flight simulator shall not a ground base simulator. The in-flight simulation must be capable of emulating transport category aircraft flight characteristics.  Additionally, the respondent should have demonstrated experience in training pilots in aerobatics with emphasis on unusual attitude recovery and accelerated flight. The FAA found one party that meets these requirements.  CALSPAN UB Research Center, Inc. is the incumbent contractor providing these services.  The estimated value of this effort for one year is $200K. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense. Parties that can meet this requirement should reply via email, by close of business  June 9, 2006 to the Contracting Officer, Carmencita Strange, at carmencita.strange@faa.gov

The period of performance is anticipated to be 4 years, beginning about September 30, 2006. 

The goal of the Business Environment Improvement (BEI) Project is to reduce the regulatory and administrative burden for SMEs by working with Governments to streamline processes and through informed and effective dialogue and partnerships between the private sector and public sector.  The project will result in better SME policies, deregulation at the local, national and regional level, and proper implementation of laws and regulations, thus leading to an improved business environment for SMEs.  Specifically, processes to be targeted will include, but are not necessarily limited to, impediments or obstacles in the following areas:
Business licensing and permits;
Government inspections;
Land site acquisition and obtaining permits for real estate construction and development;
Registering or deregistering a business; registering to pay taxes and social payments;
Procedures and practices of government procurement of SME products and services;
Tax policy and tax administration;
Health, safety, technical, environmental, and other business-related regulations. 

To achieve this goal, the BEI project will have two components: 1) Strengthening of Commercial Law Framework, and 2) Improved Regulatory Processes (IRP).
The estimated cost of the contract over the 4 year period is $16 to $17.5 million.  It is anticipated that RFP for this work will be issued on/about June 1, 2006 and that award will be made on or before September 30, 2006.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR 5 CUBIC FEET PER MINUTE (CFM) MICROLITH ELECTROTHERMAL SWING ADSORPTION (ESA) FILTER.  The technical areas of interest are electrothermal swing adsorption (ESA) technologies that can be used to provide air filtration of toxic gasses and vapors.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) are interested in demonstrating, in a side-by-side comparison, multiple ESA technologies using different adsorbent morphologies.  This effort is to provide the particular morphology of a non-carbonaceous adsorbent attached as a thin film onto a wire mesh structure, aka Microlith™.  Objective at program’s end is for the components, as well as the entire system, to be available commercially.  The Government contemplates a program which would consist of 2 phases.  The first phase is expected to be 12 months.  The total program length is expected to be up to 2 years. 

Goals for the first phase include: the construction of two each 5 CFM regenerative air filter modules using Microlith™ adsorbent, optimized for removal of chemical warfare agents and toxic industrial materials.  The performance, size, weight, and power consumption of the filter modules will be optimized and will be used as a metric for comparison to competing technologies. 

Goals for the final phase are expected to be as follows:
Optimization, refinement, and scaling of the design for prototype testing. 
 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability in meeting the requirements stated above by submitting, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities (See Numbered Note 25) within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Detachment Philadelphia intends to acquire on an other than full and open competitive basis, additional software system design, development, analysis, and maintenance services in support of the Joint Theater Level Simulation (JTLS) system of the Joint Warfighting Center (JWFC) of the U. S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), Suffolk, VA from Rolands & Associates under contract N00140-04-D-0011.  This requirement is to increase the level of effort by 20,900 hours and the ceiling by $2,000,000.00.  The additional level of effort necessary will facilitate the additional software upgrades necessary to JTLS modeling capabilities.  New capabilities are required to meet the expanding requirements and increased fidelity demanded of the simulation in order to support the Joint Warfighting Center’s (JWFC) Joint National Training Capability overall joint training and experimentation mission and USJCOM’s support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) training and transformation mission.  These capabilities will also support joint interagency, intergovernmental and multinational (JIIM) modeling.  

The acquisition is being processed on the basis of Other than Full and Open Competition, sole source to Rolands & Associates Corporation, 500 Sloat Ave., Monterey, CA 93940-3535 under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Rolands & Associates Corporation is considered the only responsible source capable of providing the required, additional support of the JTLS system, as this firm designed and developed the JTLS and has been the only source that has made continuous functional and system upgrades since system implementation in 1983.  As such, Rolands & Associates Corporation is considered the only responsible source capable of fulfilling the Government’s requirements.        

All other responsible sources may submit documentation for consideration regarding their ability to provide the required services.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Such information, if submitted, should be forwarded to FISC Norfolk Contract Department Philadelphia Office, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083, to the attention of John D. Favata, Code 270.2E, and reference RFQ N00140-06-Q-2302.  The placement of a modification to contract N00140-04-D-0011 is contemplated.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Themis Computer Incorporated, 3185 Laurelview Court, Fremont, CA 94538 for the acquisition of three (3) ECDIS-N Servers.  The servers will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  It is a very new system that has just been installed at the Ingleside schoolhouse and USS Devastator this month.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Themis Computer Incorporated is the sole manufacturer for this ECDIS-N Server.  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has already gone through and passed environmental and shock testing with this part installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PC has been assigned as the In-Service Engineering Activity and tasked to procure interim support parts; so, time is an!   issue.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly in time and dollars to the government and to the mission.  Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that the servers are acquired from Themis Computers.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to RJE Technologies, Inc of Irvine, CA for forty-six (46) ULB-350 underwater beacons and one (1) beacon test set. This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The ULB-350 Underwater Beacon developed and sold by RJE Technologies is a small, rugged and reliable acoustic signaling device used for marking equipment underwater. It is unique in that it can be programmed to a frequency (45KHz) that does not interfere with the frequency of the AN/AQS-20A sonar, has a 20 day operating life using an off-the-shelf 9 volt battery that adds the advantage of cost effective maintenance, can be programmed with an activation delay to conserve battery life, and is the only known commercially available device that will fit in the same space (3.5” x 1.7”)  as the existing transponder wi!  thout having to modify the towed body. Therefore RJE Technologies is the only known source for this item.  Note 22 applies. NAICS 334511 applies. FSC 6350.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport has a requirement for Thermal Batteries for the ADCAP MK 48 Torpedo.  The ADCAP Thermal Battery is an internal component of the ADCAP torpedo and its design requires the use of an initiator to start the chemical reaction.  Such initiator is considered an Electrically Initiated Device (EID) that utilizes an electrical discharge to produce an explosive, pyrotechnic, or thermal output.  It is well known that torpedoes are made of subsystems that contain both fuel and explosives.  Therefore, it is required that the design of this thermal battery ensures protection against accidental ignition of the initiator or other torpedo subsystems containing fuel or explosives.  In addition, storage, handling, assembly, or transportation of this thermal battery needs to comply with explosives handling guidelines mandated by the department of defense.  Contractors shall submit a design plan that is in accordance with ADCAP Thermal Battery Requirement Specification 6300535, Drawing #6300534, MIL-I-23659, MIL-STD-2073-1C, MIL-STD-129P, MIL-STD-130M, MIL-I-45208 (recommended to be used as guidance), MIL-HDBK-454A (replaces MIL-STD-454), MIL-HDBK-1512 (replaces MIL-STD-1512), MIL-STD-464A (replaces MIL-STD-1385) and MS90363 (recommend it be used as a guidance).  Specifically the Thermal Battery shall produce an output voltage of 225-300 V dc at a constant load of 875 W for a continuous interval of 11 seconds, starting at 775 milliseconds after initiation.  Such initiation will occur as a result of discharging an external capacitor into an initiator.  The battery output voltage shall remain within the range of 225-300 V dc from 500 -775 milliseconds after initiation and thereafter shall remain within 225-300 V dc for a minimum of 11 seconds.  A list of requirements that shall be met during qualification will be provided in the RFP. .  The Drawings will not be exhibited on our web site.  You must be Joint Certification Program (JCP) registered to obtain the drawings.  Please email your request for drawings to Lori Rosario at rosariola@npt.nuwc.navy.mil citing RFP N66604-06-R-3337, Company name, address, cage code and JCP number.  The Joint Certification Program (JCP) established the eligibility of a U.S. or Canadian contractor to receive technical data governed by DoD Directive 5230.25.  This Directive sets forth policies, procedures and responsibilities for the withholding of unclassified technical data from public disclosure.  DoD Directive 5230.24, a companion directive, establishes the distribution marking system for DoD-controlled technical documents.  The U.S. / Canada Joint Certification Program is managed by the U.S. / Canada Joint Certification Office (JCO).  The JCO is located at the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 (Tel. 800-352-3572) and online at www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/.  The JCO receives and processes certification forms submitted by U.S. and Canadian contractors that wish to obtain access to unclassified technical data disclosing critical technology under the control of, or in the possession of DoD.  Additionally, Paragraph 3.2.5.7 and Figure 3, Hydrostatic Cycling Profile, of ADCAP Thermal Batteries Specification 6300535 makes reference to a confidential drawing 5759651.   In order to receive this drawing, contractors must have a Confidential security clearance.  Offerors will be required to submit a design plan along with a technical proposal that addresses both Technical Capabilities and Past Performance.  Technical Capabilities includes sufficient information concerning their experience in designing, testing and manufacturing thermal batteries, resources (experience personnel, equipment, testing capabilities, investment plans (if any)), and estimated lead time to manufacture a qualification lot.  Award will be based on Greatest Value to the Government  The resulting contract will require delivery 6 months after award of 30 batteries (15 preproduction and 15 qualification).  It is anticipated that the production buys will be approximately 1,000 units per year for the next 10 years.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services to review cancer death cases regarding the NCI Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Death Review Committee (DRC) with Dr. Walter Lawrence, 6501 Three Chopt Road, Richmond Virginia 23226.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard in $6M. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial is a large scale, randomized study to determine whether certain screening tests will reduce the number of deaths from these cancers.

Contractor Requirements: 1) Review thirty (30) cases that have evidence of prostate, lung, colon, rectal or ovarian (PLCO) cancer, evidence of a condition associated with a PLCO organ, or a death of unclear etiology, 2) Evaluate the adequacy of the information, 3) Consider the participant's death to be: definitely due to; probably due to; probably not due to; or definitely not due to; prostate, lung, colorectal or ovarian cancer, 4) Consider whether or not other competing disease processes contributed to death, 5) Complete the Cause for Death Questionnaire, 6) Participate in conference calls to discuss cases where there was disagreement for either the cause of death or the site of the cancer. This review process plays an important role in minimizing bias in assignment of PLCO cancer as cause of death on the death certificate and therefore ensures a more accurate assessment of the value of these PLCO screening exams.

The PLCO Screening Trial is a high profile NCI trial accounting for about half of all cancer deaths in the United States in its focus. As the primary endpoint of this multi-year screening study is mortality from the four (4) PLCO cancers, it is essential that Dr. Lawrence’s expertise be utilized in the PLCO death review process. Dr. Lawrence is uniquely qualified to serve on this review committee. He has been chairman of the American College of Surgeon’s Commission on Cancer as well as national president of the American Cancer Society and he currently serves on its board of directors. This expertise, combined with his experience as a member of fourteen NIH cancer review committees make Dr. Lawrence the only feasible candidate for this position on the PLCO death review committee.

Period of Performance: Base year: June 15, 2006 - June 14, 2007 with four (4) twelve (12) month options.

<DESC>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with CGI/AMS for enhancements to the services currently being provided under an existing contract(Examiner Work Stations or “X-Works”, contract OFHEO-2005-01C).  This synopsis is required because the anticipated change is outside the scope of the existing contract (estimated costs exceed 25% of the total contract ceiling).  The enhancements include: 1) establishment of “team zones” for staff in each subject matter area, corresponding to the risk areas (credit risk, model risk), or programmatic subject matter (capital, research); 2) the ability for each user to customize a portal page to enhance employee productivity; 3) add functionality and streamline processes (risk structure changes, document types, MRA JSP, etc.); 4) assessment of the current architecture; 5) include functionality to organize and display schedules for supervisory activities; and 6) extend the current on-site support staff.  The contractor is required to review each option and price the options using a cafeteria pricing structure.  CGI/AMS is the only contractor with the expertise to provide these enhancements in a time effective manner, has the current expertise, and at a cost that is reasonable to the effort required.

The contractor shall perform tasks as specified by individual work assignments issued by the Contracting Officer.  The contractor must possess the capability to provide multi-purpose, multi-tasked products, often on a quick turn around basis to meet the EPA?s ambitious schedules.  The effluent guidelines program is responsible for setting the nation?s technology based standards for industrial pollution control. The Clean Water Act requires EPA to publish a plan every other year that describes the Agency?s approach to revising or developing effluent guidelines over the coming years.

<CONTACT>OTELIA D. NEWSOME, Contract Specialist, Phone: (919) 541-3164, E-Mail: newsome.otelia@epa.gov
<DESC>Modification  #2 is hereby issued to make the following changes.  Procurement # PR-NC-06-10267 is being divided and will be processed as two separate efforts, PR-NC-06-10267 and PR-NC-06-10527, with two separate solicitations being issued as indicated by the revisions below.  PR-NC-06-10267 will be processed as a  full and open competition. PR-NC-06-10527 will be processed as a 100% small business set-aside.  This notice has also been issued under PR-NC-06-10267.  Please refer to PR-NC-06-10267 to view the original synopsis and modification #1 which also apply to this effort, PR-NC-06-10527.  Other changes are below. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for Support for the Metals, Minerals, and Energy Sector.   With the finalization of the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy in July of 1999, the EPA introduced and outlined its ?risk-based? air toxics program, which includes both regulatory and non-regulatory programs and actions.  In addition, the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy lists the goals of the EPA?s air toxics program, which are as follows:  (1) reduce the incidence of cancer attributable to exposure to hazardous air pollutants by 75% nationally; (2) reduce national non-cancer risks substantially; and (3) address risks which are disproportionately posed on specific subpopulations and geographic areas.   In order to accomplish these goals, the EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  This component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives which focus on multi-media and cumulative risk, such as the Great Water program and EPA?s persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.   The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach. The purpose of these contracts is to provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA?s air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  Based on the division of this effort into two parts (PR-NC-06-10267 & PR-NC-06-10527,) EPA anticipates the award of two (2) cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contracts with a base period of performance of six (6) months, with four (4) additional twelve-month option periods. The total duration of the proposed contracts is fifty-four (54) months.   The contract resulting from PR-NC-06-10267, is to be awarded on the basis of full and open competition, and will consist of 5,000 base quantity labor hours and 15,000 optional quantity labor hours for the base period plus 10,000 base quantity labor hours and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours for the four option periods.  For the contract resulting from PR-NC-06-10267, the total contract maximum is 180,000 labor hours.   The contract resulting from PR-NC-06-10527, is to be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside, and will consist of 5,000 base quantity labor hours and 15,000 optional quantity labor hours for the base period plus 10,000 base quantity labor hours and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours for the four option periods.  For the contract resulting from PR-NC-06-10527, the total contract  maximum is 180,000 labor hours. Neither effort is a follow-on effort.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 with a size standard of $6.5M in average annual receipts over the last three years.  There are no changes to the published draft Statement of Work (SOW), draft evaluation criteria, and Conflict of Interest (COI) clauses which can be reviewed at  EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  The solicitations are scheduled to be issued on or around June 9, 2006.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation.    The solicitations and amendments will be available via the World Wide Web at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Firms are encouraged to access the solicitations and amendments via the Internet.  If you obtain a copy of the solicitations via the Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitations is are posted to ensure that you have the most up-to-date information about these procurements.  Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  The Government is not obligated or committed to award any contracts as a result of this notice.  See Note 26.

<DESC>A.         THIS IS A BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA UAVB 06-0002) FOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE BATTLELAB INVESTIGATION OF HEAVY-FUEL ENGINES FOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES (UAVs)


B.         INTRODUCTION 

The UAVB invites concept papers with preliminary cost estimates on innovative heavy-fuel engines for use in UAVs.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.   Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984".   Paper copies of concept papers in response to this announcement shall be submitted to 99 CONS/LGCC, marked for “BAA UAVB-06-0002”, 5865 Swaab Blvd Bldg 588 Nellis AFB, NV 89191-7063.  Electronic submission of concept papers may be made to david.huber@nellis.af.mil and leslie.snodgrass@nellis.af.mil by attaching the document to e-mail.   Responses should reference the above BAA number and provide telephone and email contact information.   This announcement is open and effective until 15 JUNE 2006.  Concept papers in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period.  Concept papers received after this date shall not be entertained.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic and offers should be on the alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  Additionally, this BAA and all amendments and information related to this announcement will be posted electronically on the internet to the Federal Business Opportunities at http://www.fedbizopps.gov

C.         OBJECTIVE

(1) Technical Description: 

The mission of the UAV Battlelab is to rapidly identify and demonstrate innovative concepts which exploit the unique characteristics of RPAs/UAVs to meet the warfighter’s needs.

This BAA requests concept papers to identify the feasibility and military utility of using heavy-fuel engines to power a wide range of unmanned aircraft (UA) with particular interest in small heavy-fuel engines (<35hp). 

The offeror’s proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of a MATURE, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY.

All responses to this BAA will be evaluated for applicability to the aforementioned need.         

Should an offeror submit a concept that is better aligned with the needs of another Battlelab or requiring activity, the UAV Battlelab will send written notice of this fact with reference to the appropriate activity. 

D.         ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Potential offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference number “BAA UAVB-06-0002” with their submissions. Potential offerors are required to register their company information at www.ccr.gov before any contracts can be awarded to that company.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.     

E.         CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 

The submitter should mark the concept paper with a protective legend similar to that found in FAR 52.215-1.  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired.  Offerors’ concept papers are not to exceed five (5) pages, and should be sent to the physical or e-mail address(es) listed in section A of this announcement (e-mail is the preferred medium).  However, if you do not have the capability of transmitting the concept paper electronically, submit two (2) copies, not to exceed 5 pages each, of the proposed concept to Maj Huber at the address in cited in this BAA.  The concept paper shall be formatted as follows: 

Section A: Title, Submitter, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone#, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address; Period of Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost of effort. 

Section B: Problem Statement, Need Statement, or Operational Impact statement that concisely summarizes how the product of the demonstration will enhance UAV operations.

Section C: Proposed Solution summarizing innovative concept and use of mature, commercially available technology to accomplish the demonstration .  Please discuss how you perceive your technology to be mature and commercially available (e.g., existing contracts, commercial use of your product, commercial catalog pricing, etc.).

Section D: Proposed Concept Demonstration concisely describing the demonstration and execution methodology. 

Section E: Support Components required for the demonstration to include hardware, software, data, facilities and training.

Section F: Expected Results, Benefits or Product of the demonstration. 

Section G: Proposed AF and DoD operational users of the concept; and 

Section H: Identify similar contracts to include the point of contact, current telephone number,  address, and value of the contract.  For papers marked proprietary, the offeror shall submit a non-proprietary title and summary, not to exceed one (1) additional page.

Multiple concept papers addressing different research areas may be submitted by each offeror; however, each concept paper should address only one concept.  Those concept papers found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and price proposal.  AN INVITATION BASED UPON A SUBMITTED CONCEPT PAPER DOES NOT ASSURE THAT THE OFFEROR WILL BE AWARDED A SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT. 

F.         BASIS FOR AWARD

(1) Concept papers will be evaluated as they are received based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other concepts submitted under this announcement.  Concept papers will be evaluated under the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 

(a) The extent to which the proposed concept enhances UAV operations.  In the case of a new heavy-fuel engine, UAV operations could be enhanced by providing longer endurance, higher payload, safer operations, etc. 

(b) Technical merit of the proposed concept with emphasis on the following parameters:

	1) Power to weight ratio of the engine (include weight breakdown)
	2) Specific fuel consumption (lb/hp-hr)
	3) Endurance
	4) Noise
	5) Vibration
	6) Production maturity (how many have been built already?)

(c) Innovation of design (is this technology evolutionary or revolutionary?), and 

(d) Proposed cost.     

All four areas, (a) through (d), will be evaluated at the same time during the evaluation process.     No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the concept papers.

(2) Anticipated Period of Performance: Anticipated average duration of demonstrations will be up to 18 months from time of award through complete evaluation and demonstration of the operational concept.  However, some initiatives may require more resources depending on complexity of the concept.  Type of contract(s) expected: Firm-Fixed Price (Unless another contract type is determined by the contracting officer to be more appropriate).  Primary appropriation type: Operations and Maintenance

If awarded in BT sizes, Contractor would need to add these sizes to their FSS and the stock would be distributed through McKesson.  McKesson could restrict these line items for sale to VA only facilities, however, if that is desired. OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  A request for quotations will be issued on or about May 30, 2006. NOTE:  PRODUCT MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured and an award wil be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Pacific Islands Sustainable Development and Intergovernment Office located in Kihei, Hawaii intend to procure on a sloe source basis with Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) for use of Remote Autonomous Vehicles to explore reef habitat in Hawaii. The project  will utilize data collected from automous vehicles that will send back data through video captured by remotely operated water going crafts (AUV’s).  These are small untethered and battery powered “submarines” equipped with various sensors and video capturing devices that can collect data as it cruises along a prescribed path. Sensors can be built in to the AUV to measure water quality parameters such as temperature, pH, and salinity, as well as take still images and short video. “Missions” can be designed that direct the vehicle to take snapshots and sense water quality measurements at defined locales, depths, or times, such as along a specified sampling transect. Alternatively, vehicles can be
remotely driven to sample randomly at the user’s discretion. A variety of observations could be made that could address species diversity, water quality and coral conditions such as bleaching and disease prevalence,or distribution of alien species. The data collected by the autonomous vehicles can then be streamed back to land and subsequently disseminated through the internet bringing the marine world to the fingertips of any computer user. This is of particular value for classroom science inquiry, where students can design studies to test their own hypotheses. In the short term, data obtained from a single AUV could be integrated into local classrooms for students to begin virtual underwater sampling. In the longer term, a small fleet of crafts can be used to explore other National Marine Sanctuaries of the Pacific Region, including the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary in American Samoa, and the habitats of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. Project Implementation--In May of 2005, HIMB and the National Marine Sanctuary Program formed a partnership to undertake a series of research projects addressing data needs for ecosystem management of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve (NWHICRER). The numerous research projects focus on basic ecological and evolutionary questions such as population connectivity.  NOAA already has MOU in place with the HIMB.  This project builds on work already undertaken in the past few years. HIMB’s primary involvement with the Pacific Region NMS Program centers on providing science based information to contribute to an ecosystem approach to management in the NWHICRER, and in the future will incorporate studies at Fagatele Bay NMS. Reef Missions lessons will be designed to closely align with the monitoring and research programs in the NWHI as performed by HIMB researchers such that it will build education capacity, public awareness and stewardship as described in the Ecosystems Mission Goal’s outcomes, objectives and strategies. In addition, the science based inquiries that will be performed by students also address both the Climate and Weather and Water Mission Goals. Specifically, we will through education increase awareness on the effects of climate on water temperatures and coral reef ecosystem health, as well as the effects of storm driven coastal run-off and sewage spills. Finally, by cultivating interest in our local students, we ultimately address one of the key NOAA Mission Support strategies, namely, attracting and maintaining a competent and diverse workforce that contributes to accomplishing NOAA strategic goals. The period of performance July 2006 through December 2006. This notice may represent the only official notice. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $10,000

<DESC>This requirement is being procured and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service  (NMFS)located in Seattle, WA intend to procure on a sole source basis with Alaska Department of Fish and Game to conduct the 2006 large mesh and small mesh surveys in the Gulf of Alaska and provide NMFS the indentified data.  Two types of bottom trawl surveys are conducted annually by the ADF&G Westward Region. The first uses a 400-eastern otter trawl and is referred to as the ‘large-mesh survey’. Conducted annually since 1988, the large-mesh trawl survey has consisted of approximately 400 hauls within the central and western Gulf of Alaska (GOA), from Cape Douglas to the eastern Aleutian Islands. The large-mesh trawl survey occurs from June to September. Although the large-mesh survey was developed primarily to assess crab resources, groundfish abundance and size composition data are also collected.

The second ADF&G survey uses a three-bridle, high-opening shrimp trawl and is referred to as the ‘small-mesh survey’. This survey consists of approximately 110 hauls each year, with the central and western Gulf surveyed in alternating years. Chiniak Bay and Marmot Bay, adjacent to Kodiak Island, have been surveyed annually. The small-mesh survey is conducted in late September through October. Primarily developed to assess shrimp resources, this survey also collects forage fish and groundfish abundance and size composition data, similar to data collected by NMFS from Pavlof Bay. The Pavlof Bay annual assessment has occurred for over 30 years.

Objectives and Need for Assistance: The objective of this project is to enhance data collection on groundfish species in the Central and Western Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and extend the ADF&G small-mesh survey to Pavlof Bay. Valuable data for assessment and management of commercial groundfish stocks in the GOA is gained by increasing the scientific sampling crew size aboard the R/V Resolution during the annual ADF&G large and small mesh trawl surveys. This assistance is needed to fund the salary, benefits, and supplies for an additional FWT II on the scientific sampling crew. Assistance is also necessary to supplement vessel fuel costs, upgrade sampling equipment and extend the small-mesh survey to an additional area.

Objectives and Expected Benefits: This project benefits ADF&G by enhancing the quantity and quality of data collected annually on the marine resources located both inshore and offshore. This project benefits NMFS by providing annual data on groundfish stocks that are assessed and managed by NMFS. The ADF&G small-mesh trawl survey of Pavlof Bay will continue a valuable time series. The cost is negligible relative to fielding a new trawl survey to gather the same data.
These data are only available from the existing ADF&G westward large mesh and small mesh trawl surveys. The period of performance is July 2006 through June 2007. This notice may represent the only official notice. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.00

<DESC>USDA, VS is canceling this solicitation in accordance with FAR 15.206(e).  All proposals received exceeded the budget significantly.  Our analysis leads us to believe we did not allow adequate time for accurate pricing from subcontractors.  We also believe it would have been helpful to allow for deduct alternate items as a means to reduce the scope of work to fit within the available budget.  A new solicitation will be issued to accommodate these changes.

Broad Agency Announcement VS-06-04
Air Force Research Laboratory
Space Vehicles Directorate

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Kirtland AFB, NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in space and missile technology; specifically, in the Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS): The Alternative Infrared Satellite System (AIRSS) program is being managed by the Developmental Planning Directorate of the Air Force Space and Missile Command (SMC/XR).  AIRSS is a parallel program to the Space Based Infrared Satellite (SBIRS) High geosynchronous satellite number 3 (GEO 3).  The decision to produce GEO 3 or AIRSS will be dependent on developmental success of the geosynchronous satellites, and the technical maturity demonstrated by AIRSS.  The decision is expected to be made in FY08.

To help support the FY08 decision gate, the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) is executing Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS) under SMC/XR support.  The overarching goal of RR-AIRSS is to raise the maturity of the critical technologies through component and system-level performance test, environmental test and flight qualification.  The goal of RR-AIRSS is to produce the quantitative data needed to define a highly-reliable AIRSS Program Baseline for Functional Design, Budget, and Schedule and enable a low-risk on-ramp into SBIRS if needed.  The RR-AIRSS is soliciting proposals in 2 general areas: 

Topic 1.  Integrated AIRSS Payload Experiments:  Candidate infrared (IR) payloads will be assembled from components with high Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and seek quantitative systems-level verification through ground performance and environmental test.  The integrated payloads will be tested for performance comparison to SBIRS and DSP-like requirements.   The integrated payloads will be fully flight-qualified through environmental testing focused on vibration, shock, thermal-vacuum, and electromagnetic interference (EMI).  This approach is designed to offer the most iron-clad risk reduction for AIRSS, as opposed to striving for the greatest possible payload performance.

Topic 2.  Critical AIRSS Component Development:  Design work under Topic 1 is expected to identify key areas where technology development at the component level will have major impact on the systems-level performance of the integrated payload.  Topic 2 will solicit proposals at the component level for technology development and component-level flight qualification.  Component level elements of primary interest include, but are not limited to, large area focal plane arrays, cryocoolers, advanced data processing hardware and algorithms, and wide-field-of-view (WFOV) telescopes.  The goal of efforts funded under Topic 2 will be to provide quantitative data or demonstrated capability needed to include the component in an integrated payload.  Where applicable, components should be environmentally tested for suitability in a flight system.

This effort may require access to and processing of classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN.  Specific security guidance can be addressed to the Security Point of Contact listed below. This acquisition involves data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. A foreign disclosure review of the technical data has been accomplished and RR-AIRSS technical data are subject to export controls. All prospective offerors shall have appropriate clearances to participate in this acquisition.  The availability and commitment of adequately cleared personnel, required facilities, automated information system (AIS) and communications to support the effort in a timely and acceptable manner at the appropriate level of classification is required.

Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms is revising publication 5300.5, “State Laws and Published Ordinances – Firearms”.

ATF intends to negotiate with the National Criminal Justice Association (NCJA), 444 North Capitol Street NW, Washington, DC, under 41 USC 253 (c) (1) –Only One Responsible Source, for these services.  Using legal data bases NCJA will identify amendments and new statutes or ordinances enacted during the most recently completed legislative sessions of all United States jurisdictions (including all of the states, American Samoa, District of Columbia, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and major cities that make their laws readily accessible to the general public).  This is a 100% Small Business set-aside using NAICS Code number 813410.  The contract will be for one year with four one-year option periods. Please respond March 21, 2006 by 2:00 P.M. EST.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Brushless DC Motors, Solicitation No. NNG06152245L which was posted on May 8, 2006.  You are notified that the purpose of this modification is to answer questions that were submitted. 1.  Would NASA be willing to accept an offer for a housed DC motor for this requirement?  No, That would require changing many other things which is not acceptable. 2.  The shaft tolerances are very tight and we need relief on the 1,372 dimension's tolorance of +/- 0.0001. We would request no less than +/- 0.0002. Is this acceptable?  No, the shaft tolerance must be what is in the specification to fit with other parts that are on order.  This tolerance has been met in the past. 3.  The shaft roundness of 0.0002 is also difficult to maintain and we would like to pursue how much this tolerance could be increased?  This tolerance cannot be increased.  This is also necessary to assure a good fit with other parts that are already on order.  This tolerance has also been met in the past. 4.  The end feature of the hex hole on the shaft has a +/- 0.005 tolerance which is not necessary.  This is an implied tolerance because it is not specified and the 3 significant figures dictates this tolerance.  We feel this is for some kind of allen wrench hole used to hold the shaft during tightening and assembly.  We would request this tolerance be +/- 0.010. Is this acceptable?  Drawing 2087009 has a hex hole on both ends dimensioned as .158 +.002/-.000 AF.  It is for an allen wrench.  The tolerance could possibly be larger (maybe +.003/-001), but not as large as +/- .005 or +/- .010.  This could lead to an unacceptably sloppy fit or the hole being too small for the wrench. 5.  The operating voltage called out in 3.3 has a range from  22.5 ~ 33.5 volts.  If we have to meet the operating point at the low voltage, our motor constant would be very high for the package and the resistance very low.  This would make manufacturing the motor very difficult.  However, if we are allowed to design for closer to the nominal of this range, the motor is much easier to produce.  Please comment. The operating point must be met as stated in the specification (at 22.5 volts).  This stems from a system requirement and cannot be changed. 6.  Section 5.0 Testing asked for 3 independent tests of hysteresis, eddy current and cogging.  The eddy current and hysteresis would have to be combined test giving one value for total iron loss for these 2 values.  We do not have the means to test each separately.  Will this be acceptable?  this is acceptable. 7.  The torque of 0.21 N.m and a speed of 370 r/s min is specified.  We understand this to mean that these two items form the load point.  Is this correct or is one the stall torque and the other a no-load speed giving a lighter runningload point? These two items form the load point.  The motor must provide 0.21 Nm of torque when spinning at 370 rad/s and supplied with 22.5 volts.  Other constraints apply to the load point, as stated in the specifications. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<CONTACT>OTELIA D. NEWSOME, Contract Specialist, Phone: (919) 541-3164, E-Mail: newsome.otelia@epa.gov
<DESC>Modification  #2 is hereby issued to make the following changes.  Procurement # PR-NC-06-10267 is being divided and will be processed as two separate efforts, PR-NC-06-10267 and PR-NC-06-10527, with two separate solicitations being issued as indicated by the revisions below.  PR-NC-06-10267 will be processed as a full and open competition. PR-NC-06-10527 will be processed as a 100% small business set-aside.  This notice will also be issued under PR-NC-06-10527.  Other changes are in bold print below. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for Support for the Metals, Minerals, and Energy Sector.   With the finalization of the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy in July of 1999, the EPA introduced and outlined its ?risk-based? air toxics program, which includes both regulatory and non-regulatory programs and actions.  In addition, the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy lists the goals of the EPA?s air toxics program, which are as follows:  (1) reduce the incidence of cancer attributable to exposure to hazardous air pollutants by 75% nationally; (2) reduce national non-cancer risks substantially; and (3) address risks which are disproportionately posed on specific subpopulations and geographic areas.   In order to accomplish these goals, the EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  This component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives which focus on multi-media and cumulative risk, such as the Great Water program and EPA?s persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.   The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach. 	The purpose of these contracts is to provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA?s air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  Based on the division of this effort into two parts (PR-NC-06-10267 & PR-NC-06-10527,) EPA anticipates the award of two (2) cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contracts with a base period of performance of six (6) months, with four (4) additional twelve-month option periods. The total duration of the proposed contracts is fifty-four (54) months.   The  contract resulting from PR-NC-06-10267, is to be awarded on the basis of full and open competition, and will consist of 5,000 base quantity labor hours and 15,000 optional quantity labor hours for the base period plus 10,000 base quantity labor hours and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours for the four option periods.  For the contract resulting from PR-NC-06-10267, the total contract maximum is 180,000 labor hours.   The contract resulting from PR-NC-06-10527, is to be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside, and will consist of 5,000 base quantity labor hours and 15,000 optional quantity labor hours for the base period plus 10,000 base quantity labor hours and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours for the four option periods.  For the contract resulting from PR-NC-06-10527, the total contract  maximum is 180,000 labor hours.  Neither effort is a follow-on effort.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA) plans to establish a contract for Thermoplastic Lawn Crypts at the Puerto Rico National Cemetery.  The NCA plans to establish indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract to purchase a Poly Containment System for a base year consisting of approximately 4,000 crypts and include 4 one-year options for approximately 1,500 crypts per year.  The base year of 4,000 crypts are to be installed (in Puerto Rico National Cemetery) within 365 days of receipt of a Notice To Proceed.  The remaining option years are to be exercised at the option of the government.  The locations for the crypts in the option years will be determined in the individual delivery orders for the crypts on an as needed basis.  The approximately value of the contract is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The Department of Veterans Affairs plans on negotiating a sole source contract for the poly containment system with one known contractor unless we can find other contractors who can make a similar acceptable poly containment system.  The VA would like all interested contractors to review the attached description of the Poly Containment System (Section 06500) to be used for our Thermoplastic Lawn Crypts and submit any information they have for any products that are same or similar.

<RESPDATE>072606
<ARCHDATE>05242007
<CONTACT>ROBERT VALDEZ CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3032369336     rvaldez@usgs.gov;
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Acquisition of Optimal Strong Motion Shake Table (Class A) and Strong Motion Shake Table (Class B). I.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.   It is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  Although information gathered under this Request for Information (RFI) may be used to secure funding and initiate a contract, the government does not intend to enter into a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information.  The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. II.  RESPONSES:   A.  Respondents should submit the RFI information specified below in Paragraphs IV and/or V, Proposed Minimum Specifications.  Respondents may also present several al-ternative solutions provided they meet or exceed the minimum specifications.  Responses shall be limited to 30 pages exclusive of commercial printed brochures. B.  Estimates for shake tables shall be kept separate.  The USGS is also soliciting infor-mation to determine the availability of capable contractors that can provide this equip-ment.   III.  BACKGROUND The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for an optimal strong motion shake table (Class A) and a strong motion shake table (Class B) suitable for testing accel-erometers to be used in the Advanced National Seismic System and for other purposes.  The USGS intends to install the shake tables at its Albuquerque Seismological Labora-tory located adjacent to Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, NM.  Below are specifications for both Class A and B shake tables.   IV.  PROPOSED MINIMUM SPECIFICATION FOR OPTIMAL STRONG MOTION SHAKE TABLE (CLASS A) The USGS has a requirement for a vertical (or user selectable vertical and horizontal) shake table.  The shake table shall meet the following minimum specifications.  1.  Payload Platform Size:  Sufficient to accommodate a Unit Under Test (UUT) meas-uring 21 cm wide by 21 cm long by 19 cm high, exclusive of any shielding or other obstruction. 2.  Vibration Isolation:  Not necessary.  Customer will depend on the very low back-ground noise levels at the USGS Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory. 3.  Bandwidth with good linearity and fidelity:  0.1 to 35 Hz 4.  Distortion of Waveforms:  Below -40 dB 5.  Payload:  At least 4 kg, exclusive of the platform mass and any shielding required to meet the Magnetic Field requirement. 6.  Magnetic Field:  The magnetic field strength variation at the UUT shall not exceed 0.01 gauss due to any electrical/magnetic drive mechanism or electronics associated with the shake table.  This may be accomplished by providing shielding, which is not included in the payload. 7.  Maximum acceleration capability:     5 g (9 g peak-to-peak) at all frequencies while carrying the maximum rated payload, except as limited by maximum displace-ments (i.e., stroke). 8.  Input Drive:  Voltage, with a maximum voltage in the range of either  10 V or +20 V, fully differential.  The table shall be excitable by sine waves, user-programmable arbitrary waveforms, and band-limited square waves, supplied by the user.  The table acceleration and displacement (depending on user option selected) shall be propor-tional to the input drive voltage waveform supplied by the user.  Digital-controller equivalents are acceptable as well. 9.  Maximum Displacement (stroke, peak to peak):  At least 381 mm (15.00 in.). 10.  Tilt Error of load platform through full range of motion:  Less than 1.1 milliradi-ans, preferably less than 0.11 milliradians. 11.  Roughness of path:  <0.1% of stroke (less than -60 db). 12.  Displacement Reference:  The table shall include a reference linear displacement sensor (laser interferometric or eddy current) accurate over entire stroke of table to  0.05 mm (rms noise plus linearity error). V.  PROPOSED MINIMUM SPECIFICATION FOR STRONG MOTION SHAKE TA-BLE (CLASS B)  The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for a vertical shake table suitable for testing accelerometers.  The shake table shall meet the following minimum specifica-tions. 1.  Payload Platform:  Sufficient to accommodate a UUT (Unit Under Test) meas-uring 21 cm wide by 21 cm long by 19 cm high, exclusive of any shielding or other obstruction. 2.  Vibration Isolation:  Not necessary.  Customer will depend on the very low background noise levels at the USGS Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory. 3.  Bandwidth with good linearity and fidelity:  0.2 to 20 Hz. 4.  Distortion of Waveforms:  Less than or equal to -40 dB (1%).   5.  Payload:  4 kg, exclusive of the platform mass and any shielding required to meet the Magnetic Field requirement. 6.  Magnetic Field:  The magnetic field strength variation at the UUT shall not ex-ceed 0.01 gauss due to any electrical/magnetic drive mechanism or electronics as-sociated with the shake table.  This may be accomplished by providing shielding, which is not included in the payload. 7.  Maximum acceleration capability:   4 g (8 g peak-to-peak) at all frequencies with a 4kg payload, except as limited by maximum displacements (i.e., stroke).  8.  Input Drive:  Voltage, with a maximum voltage in the range of either  10 V or +20 V, fully differential.  The table shall be excitable by sine waves, user-programmable arbitrary waveforms, and band-limited square waves, supplied by the user.  The table acceleration and displacement (depending on user option se-lected) shall be proportional to the input drive voltage waveform supplied by the user.  Digital-controller equivalents are acceptable as well. 9.  Maximum Displacement (stroke, peak to peak):      mm (6.25 in). 10.  Tilt error of load platform through full range of motion: Less than 1.1 millira-dians. 11.  Roughness of path:  Less than 0.1% of stroke (less than -60 db). 12.  Displacement Reference:  The table shall include a reference linear displacement sensor accurate over the entire stroke of the table accurate to less than 0.2 mm rms (rms noise plus linearity error).

<DESC>“THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH!   NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS--REQUEST(S) OF ANY KIND FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE”!  

1.    The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is conducting market research to acquire  a “BACK-UP SYTEM”  to the existing network and cable television programming system as well as internally generated coverage of Legislative Hearings and other events now available to Congressional Members and Staff on Capitol Hill located in Washington, DC.   The “backup system” to the present satellite programming source will be used in the event of any/all equipment failure(s)......so that programming will continue to be received from another source and provided to the CATV System Head end for distribution on the system.   The current service is provided by the U.S. Capitol Cable TV (CATV) and is obtained directly from a large Ku band antenna(s) owned by the U.S. Government.   The AOC desires a backup system to the programming currently being provided/received by these antennas in the event of equipment failures or weather-induced damage, an alternate source of the programming would be available to provide ongoing service on the CATV system. 

2.   The Cable TV service(s) (including particular programming) is required by both the Senate Rules Committee and the Committee on House Administration.  Recent system outages (both power outages and bad- weather-induced problems)at the antenna receiving site, have prompted Agency authorizing officials to request a system backup be obtained to these services.    The present CATV system consists of:   18 channels of programming from the satellite antennas, including cable news, financial and business information, and other material of interest to the Congress.  This programming is combined at the CATV Head end with local  off-air network programming and internally-generated material, and sent out on the 36-channel system to a large but constantly varying number of users across Capitol Hill.  The existing satellite antenna(s) currently operate at their physical capacity and cannot be used to access any additional satellite(s) which may carry “programming of interest”. 
	
3.   IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE, ALL INTERESTED VENDORS/CONTRACTORS will need to provide a capabilities statement which demonstrate their ability to provide the services listed above.  Offerors informational statement shall also include:   (i)  a technical description of the equipment needed to demodulate the signal to a base band, (ii)  broadcast-quality NTSC analog video and audio signal.  This signal will then be modulated and rebroadcast by the customer on the customer-owned CATV system.  All baseband signals must be presented simultaneously in order to be modulated onto their assigned CATV channel. The informational statement should include a one-time cost (if any) to provide all required equipment (at the option of the customer to purchase or obtain independently), and an ongoing cost (if any) to provide the service, as well as all applicable terms and conditions.  Any related and/or required operations and/or expenses (such as telephone lines and service, etc.) should be described within your informational statement.  All equipment installation would be done by the customer.  In the case of a terrestrial source, the signal would need to be delivered to the Russell Senate Office Building, located at the corner of Constitution and Delaware Ave NE, Washington DC. Either coax or fiber optic signal media would be acceptable.  Interested parties/companies shall submit a price quotation for providing the “back-up services” for a period of one year and renewable thereafter, eighteen (to be selected) channels of programming.  In addition, the Provider shall identify how soon service would be made available to commence following the go-ahead.   Programming would be received from the provider, -added to programming from other sources, and distributed by others to a large but varying number of users in U.S. Government Buildings on Capitol Hill for Congressional users of the Capitol CATV System.  Signals will propagate one way only inbound; there will be no interactive operation, nor will there be any charges to users.    Specific programming to be provided will be identified later.    
		
4.   Deliverables:  As previously stated, the deliverables on this project shall ultimately consist of baseband NTSC video and audio signals of the identified channels.

5.   Submission Information, Dates and Schedule:

	a.	Informational Capabilities Statement and pricing information (if any) shall be submitted
to and received by : The Architect of the Capitol, Procurement Division, Ford House Office Building, ATTN: Carolyn Horne, Contracting Officer, Room H2-263, Second and D Street, SW, Washington, DC 20515. 
Time Specified for Receipt: 2.p.m. (Local) on June 29, 2006.   

NOTICE: Current security requirements established by the US Capitol Police to screen mail being delivered to the US Capitol Complex of buildings preclude the use of US Postal Service by the Offeror to deliver their submission documents in response to this notice.  

	b.	In addition, because all packages must be screened for security purposes at a central
location prior to their delivery, the AOC cannot accept packages containing offers hand-carried directly to the address within the Ford House Office Building or any other location within the US Capitol Complex of buildings.  The only acceptable method by which the vendor can deliver their response to this notice shall be via Federal Express (FEDEX) or United Parcel Service (UPS).  Hand-carried responses to this notice will be rejected.

	c.	Cost: Costs, (if applicable) should include (and be identified as) one-time equipment cost, ongoing service charges, and any other necessary costs.

<DESC>1.  The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is soliciting interest and capability statements for a competitive acquisition for training services to provide courseware development, simulator and academic instruction for Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) for the T-1, T-6, T-37 and T-38 aircraft; Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF); Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Vehicle (RPV) Training; and Combat Systems Officer (CSO) Training services in support of the UFT and other United States Air Force (USAF) training requirements.  Services shall be provided to aircrews as assigned by AETC, currently located at Randolph AFB, TX; Vance AFB, OK; Columbus AFB, MS; Sheppard AFB, TX; and Laughlin AFB, TX.  The contractor shall provide sufficient, qualified instructors, operational, administrative, management and supervisory personnel to perform the required training services.

2.  The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing the RFP.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 611512 applies.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size for code 611512, particularly if they are a small business (the small business size standard is $21.5 million).  “Small business” means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business.  If business size is transitioning to other than “small business” in the next 90 days, please indicate as such.

3.  This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  It is not the intention of the Government to enter into a contract based on this notice or to otherwise pay for information solicited.  If the Government decides to contract for this effort at a later date with the issuance of an RFP to industry, the value of the resulting contract is estimated to be $400 million for a period of 6 years.  The anticipated award date is September 2007.

4.  Contractors will require a SECRET facility clearance.  The contract will include a DD Form 254, Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification, as the contractor will have access to classified Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) materials for working on undergraduate EWO courseware.

5.  A draft Performance-based Work Statement (PWS) has been posted along with this sources sought synopsis to provide a more detailed description of the requirement, and for any industry comments.  The PWS is still a work-in-progress, and this is NOT the final version.

6.  It is the Government’s intent to award one contract.  The Government currently plans to issue an unrestricted solicitation; however, it reserves the right to make this a small business (SB) set-aside based on the interest and technical capabilities received from SB concerns.  (Under an unrestricted solicitation, large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.)  Therefore, it is requested that SB concerns provide sufficient written information supporting their capability to perform (items H, I and J below).

7.  All interested parties are invited to provide the following information for your company/institution and for any teaming or joint venture partners:

A.  Company/Institute Name and CAGE code.
B.  Mailing Address.
C.  Point of Contact (to include phone/fax and e-mail).
D.  Web site, if applicable.
E.  State if your company is registered under NAICS code 611512 or not.
F.  State whether your company is small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned small, HUB-Zone, or 8(a) certified business concern.
G.  State the size of your company in terms of personnel.
H.  Degree of experience providing flying training instruction (classroom and simulator), and producing/maintaining courseware for the same.
I.  Identify any past or current Government contracts for flying training instruction within the last three years.
J.  Briefly describe how your company can satisfy the requirements described in the attached PWS, and your associated technical capabilities.

8.  Responses are due no later than 1600 CDT, Monday, 5 June 2006, and shall be electronically submitted to both the Contract Specialist, Mr. Andrew Feutz, at andrew.feutz2@randolph.af.mil and the Contracting Officer, Mr. Kevin Shackleford, at kevin.shackleford@randolph.af.mil in a Word 97 (or above) or Adobe PDF file format.

9.  Questions relative to this market research should be sent electronically to both Andrew Feutz and Kevin Shackleford.

Project Title:  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Research, Analysis and Materials Development on Topics Related to Food Defense

Project Description:  FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety and defense of the nation’s food supply.  The Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 9 states, “The United States agriculture and food systems are vulnerable to disease, pest, or poisonous agents that occur naturally, are unintentionally introduced, or are intentionally delivered by acts of terrorism. America’s agriculture and food system is an extensive, open, interconnected, diverse, and complex structure providing potential targets for terrorist attacks. We should provide the best protection possible against a successful attack on the United States agriculture and food system, which could have catastrophic health and economic effects.”

All food production procedures involve risk from potential hazards.  The FDA works extensively with stakeholders at the Federal, state, and local levels as well as with industry to develop effective food and agriculture defense programs which protect the food supply from the farm to the fork.  The agency’s efforts include exploring ways to strengthen systems of communication, coordination, surveillance, inspections, risk and vulnerability assessments, outreach, education, and risk mitigation.  In support of these efforts, it is necessary to have a mechanism to gather, analyze and develop current materials related to specific food defense topics.

(A) Develop new tools and materials and revise or update existing aids to assist agency with implementation of the Bioterrorism Act and other food defense programs.  

(B) Compile, organize analyze and review information/data from a variety of sources, such as literature, internet, and expert interview related to selected food defense topics for use by government agency.  Every effort shall be made to minimize bias in the review of scientific information and to document divergent opinions.  

(C) Generate materials such as documents, manuals, and presentations based upon information/data collected to support agency programs related to food defense.  

(D) Develop computer-based documents and tools such as databases and web pages that support agency food defense programs.  

(E) Perform scientifically-based research on food defense related topics.  

(F) Develop and conduct food defense training, outreach and educational efforts targeted at State, local, industry, and consumer stakeholders.

The responses to the questions below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method.  Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger).

<SUBJECT>A -- DMID Clinical Trial Management
<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with PPD Development, Inc., to continue performing Clinical Trials Management support for an additional two years, as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The proposed award represents a continuation of work originally awarded in 2003 to PPD Development Inc., under Contract N01-AI-30068.

Under the current contract, PPD is providing support in the following areas:  protocol writing, development and review; pharmacovigilance and safety oversight; clinical site monitoring and site assessment; quality management and third party audits; GCP training for DMID program staff and funded investigators; information management services and web site development and support; meeting planning and support; and a subcontract for H5 avian flu laboratory assays.  

The scope of work required that PPD provide infrastructure development to support DMID’s clinical research.  PPD developed this infrastructure de novo, specifically the customization of a clinical trials management tracking database, development of a centralized pharmacovigilance and safety oversight systems. This customized database is critical to DMID’s ability to track the status of over 400 protocols worldwide and the data transfer of over 125 protocols to the National Library of Medicine’s ClinicalTrials.gov registry.  The development of this infrastructure required more time and effort than originally anticipated.  Interruption to these activities would have a significant impact on DMID’s ability to meet the urgent demands of the pandemic H5 avian flu clinical research, as well as other Category A, B and C priority pathogen clinical research support.  

In addition, since the time of the award, the volume of clinical research performed by DMID has increased significantly due to growing biodefense efforts (e.g., smallpox, anthrax, and tularemia) and the urgency to perform pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccine research.  At the time of award, it was not anticipated that PPD would be providing support to such a high volume of high visibility clinical trials conducted with the intent for FDA licensure.  As a result, the amount of work increased dramatically due to the increased intensity of support required for these trials. 

Therefore, DMID has determined PPD is the only responsible source to provide the complex and integrated support services to meet DMID clinical research demands at this time.  If the clinical trials management support contract were awarded to another contractor at this time, it would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements on account of the vast interruption and inconsistency in oversight of the clinical research work conducted by DMID.

Therefore, no other service will satisfy DMID’s requirements.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting the information required by Numbered Note 22 on/before the closing date noted in this announcement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort. You are directed to Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26.   No collect calls will be accepted.

NOTE: 			JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
(Brand Name Only)

BUREAU OF Information Resource Management

(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a justification for other than full and open competition:
The Office of Acquisition Management (LM/ AQM), Department of State, is processing this acquisition at the request of the Systems Integrity Division. This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for procurement of SafeNet Luna products on a brand name only basis.

(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 
SafeNet Luna equipment and maintenance for continued use in support of the Department's PKI program.

(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value): 
The State Department PKI Program uses the SafeNet Luna, plus Luna support equipment, as the security component of its Entrust based Public Key Infrastructure. Interoperability of the components is essential to functional system; components not certified by Enturst and Safenet may prove non-functional in this configuration. At this time, Entrust nor Safenet cannot guarantee that products purchased from sources other than Safenet will support the continued operation of the Departments PKI. The estimated dollar value of this procurement is $43,362.00.

(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open
competition.
IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires SafeNet Luna products to be procured on a brand name only basis. Therefore, 41 use 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c), is cited at the statutory authority.

(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:
Entrust and Safenet will only provide support for products purchased from Entrust or
Safenet. If there are support issues on product not purchased through Entrust or Safenet, they will defer to the supplier of the product. Maintenance of these products is required to ensure that any problems with the equipment will be rectified immediately by Entrust and Safenet. Installation of a different hardware security module may have the following issues:
1.	Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configuration, voiding other warranties associated with the equipment and software.
2.	Interoperability cannot be guaranteed.
3.	Support for functional enhancements made to the system, as part of the PKI or future medications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.

(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD synopsis was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
Attempts were made to gain quotes on the requested items from other vendors.

(7) A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
A price analysis will be conducted to determine if the cost is fair and equitable.

(8) A description of the market research conducted and the results. or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 
Safenet is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch and support their software, as well as replace defective hardware with equipment with identical technical specification to those currently installed, Safenet, Inc. is the sole source.

(9)  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:
No additional information provided.

(10)  A list of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:
NA

(11)  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take t remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
PKI/BLADE is a COTS solution that provides PKI functionality and biometric authentication to the OpenNet. Even though it is a COTS solution, it is also a proprietary solution. Should a wider variety of digital encryption services and products become known to IRM/SI, these products will be considered as potential sources.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

                                  STATEMENT OF WORK
UNDERGROUND FUEL PIPELINE UTILITIES INVESTIGATION
NAVAL AIR STATION NORTH ISLAND SAN DIEGO, CA

1.0	INTRODUCTION

1.1	LOCATION

	Work is to be performed at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego CA.  

1.2	DESCRIPTION

The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Energy and Utilities Department is requesting an underground fuel pipeline mapping of two, JP-5, 10-inch pipelines; each pipeline is approximately 3.5 miles in length. NFESC is requesting this mapping as a result of inconclusive hydrostatic pressure tests on September 15, 2005 and September 16, 2005 under contract N47408-04-D-8503.  The required hydrostatic pressure test was unsuccessful due to air trapped inside the pipelines.  Venting the trapped air in the pipelines was not possible, because there are valve pits that can’t be located, valve handles in pits that are inoperable, and valve pit pipe risers with valves removed and capped. This investigation will MAP location and depth of each pipeline, location of vents, low point drains, and valve pits. The outcome of this investigation will determine the number and locations of vents required to successfully perform a hydrostatic test on each pipeline.

2.0	SCOPE

2.1	GENERAL

The Contractor shall provide all necessary qualified personnel, equipment and materials to map the underground fuel pipelines and document findings.

The AutoCAD drawings will be on CD and paper form.  The drawings will identify, but not limited to, the location, slope and depth of each pipeline, and the appurtenances (valve pits, valves, riser vents, and low point riser drains).   The current system has 15 manhole covers that are damaged or cannot be located. 

NFESC will be present to assess the internal piping and valves at those locations. 

3.0	GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION (GFI)

The following information will be furnished to the Contractor with this Statement of Work.  All GFI shall be returned at the completion of the project.

1.3.  SPECIFIC TASKS

1.3.1.	REQUIREMENTS.  The requirements specified in this SOW are subject to periods of fluctuation as mission and personnel requirements change.  Therefore, quantities and delivery schedules are not static and are subject to change.  Each organization will establish/maintain individual requirement quantities and delivery schedules.

B.	The Contractor shall handle all hazardous waste in accordance with all legal and regulatory requirements; including, but not limited to, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (R.C.R.A., 40 C.F.R. §240-299).  In addition, the Contractor shall:

1.4.3.	MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION ON BASE.  Contractor personnel are advised that seat belt usage is mandatory at all times while operating a motor vehicle on base.  Montana state law requires the use of restraints in a vehicle.  Air Force Instruction 31.204, Air Force Motor Traffic Supervision, prescribes that installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws both on and off base.  Accordingly, while on Malmstrom AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Security Forces personnel for failure to comply.

Also, the wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle on Malmstrom AFB is prohibited.  Violation of this policy may affect your driving privileges, as each violation will result in the loss of three (3) points.

Additionally, any persons found speeding while operating a motor vehicle on Malmstrom AFB shall be subject to the same suspensions.  Repeated offenses will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on the Contractor’s ability to perform agreement requirements.

1.5.  PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS.  The contractor must identify a Project Manager and alternate who is able to address issues and concerns that may arise during the performance of this agreement.

1.6.	INVOICES AND PAYMENTS.  The Contractor shall submit invoices by the 10th of each month for services rendered the previous month.  Each organization will pay respective invoices by Government Purchase Card.

TESTING   2.4.1   COMPATIBILITY TESTING   The following testing procedure shall be used for evaluation of compatibility between new and in-service oils (for convenience, new oils are called A oils, and in-service oils are called B oils); a.	Prepare separately 300 ml of each mixture of the following ratios: 90:10, 50:50, and 10:90 of the two oils (A and B) to be evaluated for compatibility.  The two constituent oils (100:0, and 0:100) shall be tested concurrently.   b.	Stir each mixture vigorously in a laboratory glass mixer (minimum volume capacity of one quart) for 30 minutes, and immediately transfer to a glass beaker of suitable size for each mixture.  Use a suitable rubber spatula, and squeegee the remaining oil into the glass beaker. c.	Heat the beakers with the mixtures in the oven at 65ºC (150ºF) for 168 hours (± 1 hour). d.	Remove the beakers from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature e.	Observe the oil samples according to the procedure described in paragraph 2.4.2 Appearance Rating Procedure.  If any of the oil mixtures tested display an incompatible result, conclude the test and report that the new oil is not acceptable for use.  If the results are satisfactory, proceed to the next section. f.	Cool the beakers with the oil mixtures to 0ºC (32ºF) and keep them at this temperature for 24 hours. g.	Remove beakers from the cooler and bring to room temperature. h.	Observe the oil samples according to the procedure described in paragraph 2.4.2 Appearance Rating.  If any of the oil mixtures tested displays an incompatible result, the new shall be reported as incompatible, and as such, not acceptable for use.    2.4.2   APPEARANCE RATING PROCEDURE Set up the appearance-rating test using a 150-Watt reflector flood lamp.  a.	SEDIMENT RATING - Hold the sample beaker vertically few inches above the flood lamp, without disturbing the sample, approximately ten inches in front of your eyes.  View the sample beaker from the different directions, angles and distances from the ligh t source bottom.  Assign the observed sediment rating according to TABLE 1. b.	FLUID RATING - View the sample beaker from the side, looking directly through the oil mixture.  Assign a fluid rating according to TABLE 1.  If the samples are too dark to rate for fluid appearance, they may be rated by tilting samples on side and obser ving the material adhering to the beaker. TABLE 1 CODES FOR RATING COMPATIBILITY OF COMPOUNDED OILS Fluid  Rating	Sediment Rating	Description	Result of Evaluation	    0	-	Absolutely Bright	Pass	    1	-	Bright	Pass	    2	-	Very Slight Cloudiness	Fail	    3	-	Moderate Cloudiness	Fail	    4	-	Heavy Cloudiness	Fail	    5	-	Detectable Floc	Fail	    6	-	Heavy Floc	Fail	    -	0	No Sediment	Pass	    -	1	Very Slight Sediment	Fail	    -	2	Slight Sediment	Fail	    -	3	Heavy sediment	Fail	    -	4	Appreciable More Sediment Than 3	Fail	  2.4.3   TESTING PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF OIL Chemical and physical tests shall be conducted in accordance with the Standards listed in TABLE 2.

<DESC>The Navy requires technical support to further develop/upgrade the ESS module.  In 1996, the Defense Environmental Security Corporate Information Management (DESCIM) Program Management Office (PMO) embarked on an effort to identify and migrate appropriate software systems to the target solution known as the Defense Explosives Safety Management Suite (DESMS).  DESMS consists of five distinct software modules that ultimately will function together as one seamless system.  One module is Explosives Safety Siting (ESS) module.  The Service Subject Matter Experts published an Integration Decision Paper (IDP) addressing the state-of-the-art for automated site planning and recommending migration towards the ESS applications.  Subsequently they published an ESS System/Subsystem Specification (SSS) during 1998.  These documents were updated resulting in an approved ESS System Decision Paper (SDP) dated January 2003.  The ESS System Accreditation for Version 5.0 was approved in May 2003.  Scope of Work.  This effort is to upgrade the ESS software to make it compatible with the current information systems technology.  The upgraded system must be compatible with Microsoft Windows technology (e.g.. Active-X Data Objects, graphical user interface standards) so it can be used on ESS user community workstations.  Also compatibility with Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) geographic information systems (GIS) technology is necessary to interface with the GIS applications used by the host military installation mapping systems.  Finally, the ESS architecture must be flexible so the software can be configured to meet the local information system operating environments.  This flexibility is achieved by implementing the n-tier architecture concepts so ESS can be configured as a very thick client (personal workstation), thick client (client-server), or as a thin client (web browser).  The scope is to lay the foundation for this architecture, while focusing on the personal workstation and enterprise client-server modes.  The current version of ESS will be used as the prototype.  The database model contains configuration, code, algorithm control, map feature, and administrative data tables.  The software contains data retrieval and update procedures, explosives safety business rules and procedures, system interface procedures and user interface procedures.  The database /software are the fundamental documentation for the current capability of the application.  User/training manuals, and development historical documents supplement the fundamental documentation.  This prototype clearly defines the functional requirements for the new version.  The new version of ESS shall maintain the functionality of the prototype while updating its information technology and processing efficiency and reliability.  The ESRI Geodatabase technology shall be implemented so ESS can use this technology in a personal or enterprise mode.  The latest version of the ESRI ArcObjects component will be used for the GIS engine and the spatial analysis engine.  The Microsoft .NET Framework (i.e. Visual Basic .NET, ADO.NET, Fortran.NET, etc.) shall be used.  The system shall also be capable of using the commonly used relational data base engines.  It must use Microsoft Access, Oracle, and SQL Server via ADO.NET (versions are identified in paragraph 7).  The user interface shall conform to the Microsoft Windows standard.  This means the functionality of the forms and controls must be compatible with the user experience associated with Microsoft products (e.g. Word, Excel, etc.)  The Visual Basic .NET controls are expected to be adequate to accomplishing this user experience objective.  Documents produced by ESS (e.g. text, graphic, tabular) shall be compatible with other applications (e.g. Microsoft Word and Excel, AutoCAD).  Potential MapObjects reverse compatibility strategy is required.  Compatibility is accomplished using a setup/install procedure option or an alternate method approved by the government.  The intent is to optionally install ESS so it will use dynamic link libraries associated with ESRI MapObjects rather than ArcObjects.  The focus  is only the use of ArcObjects dynamic link libraries.  However, the current source code revision shall be accomplished in a manner that will facilitate extending, when required, the source code to support optionally using MapObjects dynamic link libraries.  With this feature, one version of the source can be maintained while providing for installing either an ArcObjects or a MapObjects version.   Reference to ArcObjects in this document implies providing appropriate features to support this MapObjects option.  Maintainability of the new version is critical.  The prototype version shall be analyzed to identify procedures that can be encapsulated more rigorously.  The result will be code, including queries, which can be modified without degrading the application.  Additional software engineering approaches to achieving a robust maintainability objective are encouraged.  The new version of ESS shall include upgrades of all components necessary to compile and create executable applications.  The ESRI ArcObjects and Microsoft ADO.NET components have previously been specified.  Additional components are used to create the prototype.  All components shall be upgraded if appropriate upgrades exist.  Alternatively, while maintaining the functionality of the new version (e.g. documents produced) new technology can be substituted with the approval of the government.  The Generic Base data set will be used during development and for final acceptance.  Solutions produced with ESS version 6.0 will be compared to solutions produced by the prototype.  The quality of the two solutions shall be comparable.  The contractor shall continue the evolution of ESS to target solution version 6.0.  To do this the contractor shall provide a fixed level-of-effort support.  NFESC will reserve the right to focus the contractor’s efforts as necessary.  The delivery schedule for this work is seven (7) months after award.  Any other interested party, other than incumbent contractors, must submit their interest by 16 June 2006 of their capability to meet this schedule and for additional information.  The Point of Contact is:  Naomi Melendez, Contract Specialist, telephone 202-685-8051, fax: 1788, and email: naomi.melendez@navy.mil.
