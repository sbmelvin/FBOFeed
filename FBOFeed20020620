<DESC>The Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, plans to competitively procure the services and supplies required to design, develop, build, deploy, and support a system to record the arrivals and departures of visitors to the United States.  The system, which will be known as the Entry Exit system, will meet a myriad of architectural, technical, business processes and legislative requirements, and will enable the Government to verify and record the identities of persons who enter and exit the United States by air, land, or sea.   Specifically, the system must enable the Government to establish the identity of individuals who intend to visit the United States; verify the identity of those individuals who enter the country, noting if they overstay the terms of their entry documents; and alert government personnel if the individuals are or become identified as national security threats. In that this will be a Government-wide system, the Entry Exit System will have to interface with multiple existing (and potentially future) Government and commercial industry databases. Primary Government users include Departments of Justice, State, Treasury, and Transportation.  Vendors will be required to demonstrate interoperability, scalability, security, and evolvability in an open architecture using generally accepted standards and commercial off the shelf (COTS) products to the maximum extent possible. The INS plans to competitively procure the design, development, build, deployment and sustainment of this system through the award of one or more open market indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts under which task orders (e.g., for design, prototype development, and system build) will be awarded on a firm fixed price basis to the maximum extent possible.  The contract(s) will be awarded competitively to the offerors who offer the best value to INS, price and other factors considered.  The INS plans to issue a formal Request for Proposals for the Entry Exit system in June 2002.  The solicitation will be available online. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be distributed online.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure that they have the most up to date information about this acquisition.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mercury Technology Services under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to conduct the final phase of a three phase study to determine the mercury content of the U.S. petroleum supply. The contractor shall:  (1) Produce a Quality Assurance Project Plan, (2) Obtain crude oil samples and supporting information needed to perform statistical analysis, (3) Construct a sampling plan that will provide a statistically acceptable mean and standard deviation of the mercury concentation in the U.S. oil supply, (4)  Analyze samples, (5) Distribute samples as required and maintain chain of custody records, (6) Schedule sampling to occur such that aging does not become a factor and identify samples for which mercury speciation is required, (7) Receive, assemble and statistically analyze the data to determine the mean, standard deviation, and confidence level, and (8) provide monthly reports and a final report or peer-reviewed journal article. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  EPA source research indicates Mercury Technology Services is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement.  The work to be performed requires: extensive contacts throughout the petroleum industry;  in-depth knowledge of the pollutant chemistries of the gas and oil industry with an emphasis on the chemistry of mercury;  the ability to model the fate of various mercury speicies in the gas and oil processing industries; and in-depth knowledge of mercury cleanup and mercury control technologies available to the gas and oil industries.   Mercury Technology Services conducted the first two phases of the study and is thoroughly familiar with the project.  Its personnel are the only ones known with the required combination of knowledge, experience, abilities, and established relationships needed to complete the final phase of this study.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 15, Contracting By Negotiation.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620.  The anticipated award date is 9/20/02.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has a requirement to investigate the methodologies discussed in the literature and projects implemented by statistical agencies to create price indices for services provided by financial, medical, and nonprofit organizations.  Measures of price change for many financial, medical and nonprofit services in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA's) are believed to be less accurate than those of most other services.  Improving the accuracy of price measurement for these services is important because it affects the quality of many of the estimates of real economic activity that are measured in the NIPA's. The financial services of particular interest include the following fifteen categories: household insurance; motor vehicle insurance; medical and hospitalization insurance; private workers' compensation; income loss insurance; equities commissions; broker charges on mutual fund sales; trust services of commercial banks; investment advisory services of broker-dealers; commodities revenue; investment counseling services; commercial bank service charges on deposit accounts; commercial bank fees on fiduciary accounts; commercial bank other fee income; and charges and fees of other depository institutions.  In addition, they also include services rendered without payment by commercial banks; savings and loans; mutual savings banks; credit unions; and mutual funds.  The medical services of particular interest include those provided by the following five groups: physicians; dentists; other professional medical services; hospitals; and nursing homes. The nonprofit services of particular interest include the following twelve types of organizations: clubs and fraternal organizations; labor unions; professional associations; private higher education; elementary and secondary schools; nursery schools; foundations and nonprofit research; political institutions; museums and libraries; foundations for religion and welfare; social welfare; and religion.   The findings of this investigation will be presented in a final report that reviews the recent work on this topic and recommends feasible improvements to the current methodologies used by the BEA in the creation of it's NIPA's.  

The following tasks are to be performed: 1)  A review of the issues associated with the measurement of prices for the financial, medical, and nonprofit services;  2)   A review of the methodologies currently implemented by statistical agencies for the measurement of prices for the financial, medical, and nonprofit services;  3)  A review of the research currently being conducted by statistical agencies for improvements in measurement of prices for financial, medical, and nonprofit services;  4)  The availability of both public and private data that could be used for the measurement of prices for the financial, medical, and nonprofit services;  5)  A review of market developments over time that are likely to have affect the quality of the financial, medical, and nonprofit services; 6)  Based on the availability of public or private data, suggested changes in the measurement of prices for selected financial, medical, and nonprofit service industries.   Interested parties should submit an email to mailto: thomas.howcroft@noaa.gov with the subject line to read "Price index methodologies report".

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Robin Harris, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-0955
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Research Triangle Institute (RTI), 3040 Corwallis Road- Building 6, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709 to perform quantitative elemental content analysis by Inductively Coupled Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) on samples as described below. This will include analysis of groups of 5-10 (ICP-AES) elements and 6-10 (ICP-MS) elements characteristic of a single source emission PM, or multi element analysis of suites of  elements to provide characterization of ambient PM samples with many component sources. Elemental concentrations of interest in the samples will generally be in the microgram to sub-microgram per g range. The turn around time will be 6 weeks for a batch of 26-100 samples. This purchase allows for  the determination of elemental content of particulate matter (PM)- derived samples produced by and for the Pulmonary Toxicology Branch's PM research program. Samples will include bulk PM, PM on filters, PM extracts, and biological samples. Samples will be submitted in batches >25 samples/batch on  an infrequent and random schedule based on program needs by the Project Officer/Agency throughout the entire Period of Performance.  RTI has performed elemental metal analyses for the Human Studies Division/NHEERL on filters from the ambient air and their Concentrated Ambient Particle System  (CAPS), an experimental system used to expose human volunteers to concentrated ambient particles. A similar CAPS system is used by the Experimental Toxicology Division/NHEERL to expose laboratory rats to concentrated ambient particle matter. This collaborative research program compares and analyzes  the health effects data from both humans and rats. The rat data is extrapolated to humans and used in mathematical modeling and lung dosimetry research. The data generated in both divisions is part of the EPA's high priority PM program and is used in peer reviewed papers and publications. It has  been shown that data collected in different laboratories can yield different results. In addition, the possibility of inconsistent results would result in negative peer reviews. Since the data is used in EPA's regulatory process, it is subjected to intense scrutiny by the Federal Government, the  scientific community and the public.  Data quality and consistency is imperative. Since the past and current HSD filters have and are being analyzed by the proposed vendor, the filters from the rat exposures must be analyzed by the same vendor to eliminate unknown variables that can occur and to  eliminate potential problems in the peer review process. No other vendor is acceptable. The intended procurement vehicle is a firm-fixed price purchase order. The resulting purchase order will be written with "not to exceed" amounts including a base year [249 samples-(172 ICP-MS, 77 ICP-AES); 139  optional quantities (98 ICP-MS, 41 ICP-AES)] plus four ordering periods [324 samples each period (224 ICP-MS, 100 ICP-AES)]. The contractor will be entitled to submit an invoice and receive partial payment of the purchase order amount upon completion of any order and approval of the project  officer. The period of performance for this requirement is expected to be from the date of award through April 30, 2003.  All interested parties must respond within 15 days of the date of this announcement.  Interested parties shall: 1) include information on the proposed services which clearly  supports the requirements outlined above; 2) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, and therefore, no Request for Quote (RFQ) is available.   Consequently, any response  failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ willbe ignored.   No telephonic responses will be honored.  Submit response to U.S. EPA, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Attn: Robin Harris, Research  Triangle Park, NC  27711. Email address: harris.robin@epa.gov. Any challenge must be received by 3:00 PM on July 5, 2002. If no affirmative responses are received by the deadline  to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with RTI.

This is to recognize the additional complexity of the clinical services' research protocols conducted under the contract.  These services now require additional registered nurses and research fellows and associated project and administrative support.  The contract workstatement will remain unchanged; only the level of effort will be increased.  Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), as set forth in 6.302-1.

Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) System 

DTRS56-02-BAA-0005, due June 30, 2003, POC Warren D. Osterberg, Contracting Officer, Phone:  202-366-6942, Fax:  202-366-7974, E-mail: warren.osterberg@rspa.dot.gov

CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) is soliciting information and descriptions (White Papers) not to exceed five pages in length per project, on a technical product activity addressing areas of interest described in the SCOPE section of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  White Papers must include a cover letter (not part of the five page limit) with the offeror's contact information:  point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address, followed by not more than five pages summarizing the proposed concept or project; an outline of the principle of operation; anticipated results and/or products; uniqueness; and a description of the product's potential for application to the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) System.    

SPECIAL NOTE:  This will be an open announcement for one year and will close on June 30, 2003, unless otherwise amended.  RSPA, in coordination with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), will conduct periodic technical reviews of White Papers received about once every quarter during the year.  

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  The DOT Credential Project Office is currently establishing a standardized Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) system consisting of an electronic personal card or similar device that will positively identify transportation workers (to include government workers, contractors, and private sector employees) who require unescorted physical and logical access to secure areas and functions of the transportation system. The functional objective of the TWIC is to provide one standardized, common credential, supported by a single integrated and secure network of databases, to manage transportation worker access into secure transportation areas and operations. The TWIC architecture was briefed to vendors on April 29, 2002 in Washington, DC.  A copy of the briefing, "Credentialing Project Technical Architecture," a listing of Initial Questions, Answers, and Definitions, and other information regarding the program is available on the TSA website www.tsa.dot.gov/workingwithtsa/stakeholders.shtm.

DOT plans to design, field test, and deploy an operational TWIC system with supporting infrastructure for all transportation workers across all transportation modes. DOT intends to achieve TWIC implementation in two phases. Phase 1, currently ongoing, uses well known, fixed technology components and follows General Services Administration (GSA) specifications.  The primary goal of the Phase 1 is to establish a standardized credential, architecture, and supporting infrastructure using the GSA Government Smart Card-Interoperability Specification (GSC-IS).  The procurement vehicle for the first phase, the GSA Smart Card Contract (officially known as the Smart Access Common ID contract), was awarded in May 2000 and is not part of this Broad Agency Announcement.  It is a multiple award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with five (5) vendors currently providing standard products and services.  This contract provides Federal Departments and Agencies with an easy-to-use procurement vehicle for ordering smart card supplies and services.  Further detailed information about the GSA Smart Card Contract is available on the GSA website, www.gsa.gov/smartcards or by contacting the GSA Smart Card Team at telephone (202) 208-3055, or e-mail: smartcardteam@gsa.gov.  Also, additional information regarding the GSA Smart Card Program is availableon the following website: www.egov.gov/smartgov/smart_card.htm.

GOAL:  This announcement applies to the second phase, which will be carried out concurrently with and independently of Phase 1.  This BAA solicits White Papers on new or innovative methods, processes, and technologies (not available thru Phase 1, GSA Schedule purchases) that could be applied to the TWIC system and architecture through products, information systems, and/or business practices and systems management for concurrently upgrading and advancing Phase 1 implementation. 

SCOPE:  The focus of this Broad Agency Announcement is to address the second phase.  Specifically, the purpose is to identify promising advances, new and alternative methods and technologies, and innovative concepts for components; products and systems that will have the potential to significantly improve the functionality, performance and operation of the Phase 1 TWIC system; and promote expeditious integration of these improvements into the TWIC system established in Phase 1. While the Phase 1 involves purchases of standard items and services from a GSA Schedule, in this Phase 2, improvements in biometrics, smart cards, interoperability, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technologies will be incorporated into the TWIC system using innovation and other technology advances.  Interested offerors should refer to either of the GSA websites identified above or contact the GSA Smart Card Team at the phone number and/or e-mail address identified to obtain the most current information on Phase 1 activities.     

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Specific areas of product interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

A.	Biometrics-Interoperability: Methods to achieve interoperability between the various (perhaps proprietary) technical solutions, such as the ability for a TWIC cardholder to migrate seamlessly across a system that may include multiple but different biometric vendor solutions, e.g. three separate facilities within the system that have each selected a different (e.g. fingerprint) vendor solution. 
B.   Biometrics Device: That provides a sub-hand-held, secure, self-contained (e.g. reader independent), off-line, verification (1:1 biometric match) of identity.
C.   Card Reader System: That provides a small, hand-held, secure, wireless, GSC-IS compliant, PDA-like device that can provide both on-line and off-line verification (1:1 biometric match) of identity using a biometric template stored on the TWIC.
D.   Card Reader Device or System: That provides GSC-IS compliant, multi-technology (e.g. contact ISO 7816, contact-less ISO 14443 A& B, and magnetic stripe) reader that will provide a standard interface to the backend access control system allowing for interoperability with multiple legacy access control systems, e.g. a replacement multi-technology reader that can be installed in place of the current single technology reader and provide interface to the legacy access control system for the multiple technologies that could be fielded on the standard TWIC.
E.   Smart Card Device or System: That provides for secure interoperability between multiple contact-less technologies within one card system, such as ISO 7816 contact ICC, ISO 14443 A & B contact-less and HID, and conforms to GSC-IS and FIPS 140 standards.

White Papers must address a standardized credential that is universally recognized and accepted across the entire transportation sector; that can provide the capability for multiple levels of physical and logical access to secure or controlled areas; can be used within the local facility infrastructure; and be one that protects the personal privacy of the cardholder. The product and results must also be suitable for adoption in all modal and inter-modal transportation operations, including airports and aviation locations, highway operations, fleet and maintenance systems, high speed rail operations, transit and light rail operations, freight transportation systems, marine, ports and inter-modal systems. 

WHITE PAPERS:  DOT is soliciting White Papers from industry, consortia, Federal agencies (laboratories), state and local governments, and academia on their activities dealing with the topics described above.  Each White Paper, not to exceed five pages including appendices and backup materials, must include sufficient information for the panel to evaluate against the technical evaluation criteria.  The evaluation criteria are listed below.

EVALUATION CRITERIA: 
1)	Technical merit of the innovation for TWIC improvement,
2)	Potential for the product to make significant impact in Phase 2 application, 
3)	Time required for developing and applying results to TWIC practice,
4)	Technical background and institutional capability available to perform the project, and
5)	Cost to the Government and cost-sharing contributions.

Criteria 1 thru 4 are weighted equally for evaluation purposes.  Cost Sharing is not a requirement for consideration of White Papers.  Although cost sharing is included as part of evaluation criteria #5, it is not as important as the other criterion for White Paper evaluation. 

TECHNICAL REVIEW/EVALUATION:	  A technical panel will meet periodically (the intent is to meet at least once each quarter) to review the White Papers received in response to this announcement.  The panel will consist of experts from modal administrations within the DOT and may include representatives from other agencies. All offerors will be advised of the panel's recommendations. Submittors of White Papers selected by the panel for further consideration will be notified and requested to provide full proposals, with possible suggestions for change in scope and detailed guidelines for preparing and submitting the proposal package.  Full proposals, after review by the panel, will be considered for further discussion on the technical scope and cost before a decision is made on award of contracts or agreements, as appropriate. 

PRODUCT AND RESULTS DELIVERY AND DEMONSTRATION:  Each selected project, after negotiation, should have the results completed or products demonstrated under actual or simulated operational conditions within six (6) months of award.  Time extension beyond six (6) months, up to but not exceeding 12 months may be allowed, if warranted, on a project-by-project basis.

<DESC>NA CONTACT Kenneth Shedlock, Project Manager-Engineer, 732 532-5549. This removable canopy is used to cover-shroud a tactical assemblage that is housed inside a S-280 Shelter.  The S-280 Shelter is approximately 12 feet X6 feet X 7 feet and is normally transp orted on a 2 1/2 or 5 ton vehicle.  The removable canopy provides a sun shield to the exterior roof-sides of the shelter when military units are deployed in locations of extreme high temperatures.  It keeps the direct rays of the sun from contacting the al uminum skin surface of the shelter, thereby allowing the air conditioners to efficiently maintain the shelter interior temperature at an acceptable range for soldier operation-performance.  The technical data package for this kit is specified-described via  fully-detailed drawings.  This kit is comprised of several corner-side- aluminum bracket assemblies - which can either be welded together or these components may be casted instead, lanyard assemblies, rivnuts, screws, washers, sealant, and the 3-piece can opy which is cloth-laminated, vinyl-nylon high strength material.  One side of each canopy is a -GREEN 383- color, and the reverse side is -TAN 686- color, to allow the canopy to match the camouflauge color scheme of the deployed environment.  A picture of  the kit as installed on a shelter can be provided via fax and email when requested to the CECOM POC -below. Initial quantity for this acquisition is 138ea, with options over the next 4 years, with 138ea per year, for a grand total quantity that may equal 690ea.

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Cree Inc., 4600 Silicon Drive, Durham, NC 27703; based on (FAR 13.602,4.8GRC-P3.9.2.2); because of the following paragraph:  The NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field has been developing silicon carbide (SiC) as a high temperature semiconductor material for many years. The requestor on this PR has personally published more than 50 papers related to the growth and fabrication of SiC crystals and devices, and is considered an expert in the field. Documentation to back up this claim can be provided if requested. The requestor is aware of the few institutions throughout the world working on SiC, and currently, there is only one commercial supplier of large SiC wafers with mesas patterned by photolithographically defined trenches at least 5 µm in depth to a lateral accuracy of 5 µm or better, and that supplier is Cree, Inc. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 6-27-02 to the NASA Glenn Research Center, Attn: Dennis D. Pehotsky, 21000 Brookpark Rd., Cleveland, OH 44135; or by faxing them to (216)-433-2480. Sorry,due to tight time restraints, we cannot accept late quotes.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Design of a Drug Price Comparison Tool for the Medicare Endorsed Prescription Drug Discount Card Assistance Intitiative
<SOLNBR>CMS-02-003-ELH
<CONTACT>Derrick Heard, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-2545, Fax 410-786-9922, Email DHeard@cms.hhs.gov - Beverly Gillette, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-5142, Fax 410-786-9922, Email bgillette@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published a notice of proposed rulemaking for a Medicare-Endorsed Prescription Drug Card Assistance Initiative.  We proposed a price comparison web-site to assist in a beneficiary?s decision about what prescription drug discount card would best serve their needs.  The purpose of this contract is to develop and write the specifications for such a web-site.  In order to ensure that beneficiaries receive information on programs to assist them in making informed decisions about whether and which card program to join, the proposed initiative required that comparative information on the prices offered to Medicare beneficiaries for drugs covered by each discount card be available, and that this would be done through a web-site that makes the discount information generally available.  The end objective would be to make available the actual price a beneficiary would encounter at the point of sale.  Recognizing the technical difficulty of this, CMS proposed that ? in the first year ? discounts on the website be expressed as a percentage off the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for a standard set of the most commonly used drugs and dosages.  However, by the second year of the initiative, the proposed rule required the site to publish the actual price that Medicare beneficiaries would pay for drugs offered by each Medicare-endorsed discount card sponsor.  Participating card sponsors would be required to provide all the necessary information regarding their discount cards.  While the stated purpose of this procurement is technical, achieving the purpose of the procurement would also require providing comparative information for the actual prices offered at the retail level, which we believe is not the usual way of doing business.   Among the possible technical challenges of developing the drug selection and pricing display methodology underlying the comparison system are:  1) identifying selection criteria for determining which drugs to display (e.g., how to define commonly used drugs and establish cutoffs); 2) determining appropriate and meaningful presentations to enable beneficiaries to identify the drugs they take; 3) developing methodologies to standardize the drug identification (e.g., name brand versus generic), dosage, unit of payment (e.g., per monthly supply), and price information (alternatives to actual drug price include an average price, or maximum prices, savings and discounts.);  4)  accommodating pricing /discount/rebate variations in contracts between a card sponsor and drug manufacturers, retail pharmacies and mail order programs; and 5) assuring the system can be updated as needed to accommodate the proposed requirement that drug prices be posted for 48 hours prior to becoming active.  Further, it should be considered whether beneficiaries and other target audiences of the web-site understand the methods selected to present information and whether they would find the information sufficiently useful and complete (e.g. decision to display only commonly used drugs).  In such cases, it would need to be determined what feasible marketing and education strategies could be pursued to prevent beneficiary confusion, address beneficiary expectations, and assist the beneficiary (or the beneficiary?s advocate) in understanding any limitations to the drug information presented and how to seek clarifying information as needed.  Finally, the cost and burden to parties involved in producing data, and to building and maintaining the system must be considered.  Given the strong interest by both Medicare beneficiaries and the industry, the project must be carried out in a transparent manner and there must be access for both groups to the process.  The Government will be responsible for determining the most appropriate and feasible approach to the development of this web-site based on the best available information.  It is clear that not all parties can be satisfied, but at least it should be possible to make an optimum decision.  Thus, the project will involve an early report that presents the options with pros and cons to each.  Please be aware that the Contractor will not have the right to use, release to others, reproduce, distribute, or publish any data first produced or specifically used by the Contractor in the performance of this contract, except to the extent specifically allowed, in writing, by the Contracting Officer.  The period of performance for this project is projected to be only four [4] months and the level of effort is substantial.  Thus, interested parties should be aware that particular attention will be paid to the depth of resources presented and the plans to manage such a short/intense project. The Government will be seeking a written proposal and may invite those offerors considered technically acceptable to make oral presentations.  The successful offeror must have demonstrated knowledge of Medicare beneficiary information dissemination and in developing web-sites that supply detailed comparison information to the general public, particularly price comparison information.  Also, they must have demonstrated experience in dealing with projects in which there a variety of competing interests, particularly organizations that represent interest groups.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for any information solicited.  The purpose of this notice is to make prospective offerors aware of the formal solicitation  which is expected to be released on or about July 15, 2002.  To receive a copy of the solicitation, interested parties must submit a written request to the Contracting Officer, Edward L. Hughes, at 7500 Security Boulevard, MS C2-21-15, Baltimore, MD  21244-1850.  Telephone and facsimile requests will not be honored.

<DESC>NA The Government proposes to modify contract DSWA01-98-C-0114 with Karagozian and Case on a sole source basis to conduct a series of experiments to provide data for evaluating/validating the latest air-backed wall-response model implemented in the Munitions Effects Assessment (MEA) tool.  The validity of the air-backed wall model in MEA is important because the damage to internal walls is a major factor in the accurate prediction of other key effects.  These include WMD spillage, deflagration, and expulsion f rom either a single or multiple internal detonations.  DTRA has determined that only Karagozian and Case (K&C) has the prior knowledge and experience in the development of the code used by the MEA code.   K&C will perform pre-test predictions for a series of seven scaled-tests to be conducted

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends lease eight (8) copies of SSASIM Model Software for one(1) year from Policy Simulation Group, Inc (PSI), Washington, DC.  Further, the SSASIM licenses will allow SSA to acquire software modifications from PSI as the need arises for more efficient policy valuations in retirement (OASI), disability (DI), and income assistance programs.

PSI is the only known source with authority and expertise to provide and modify the "software" as SSA requires. 

Any other vendor claiming to have requisite authority and expertise to provide or modify the "software" must submit verifiable information that supports such assertion.  Conversely,  any other vendor that can provide comparable commercial off-the-shelf-(COTS) software must submit verifiable information (i.e., product literature, customer references, and product price) on the relevant capabilities and support for such COTS software.  Any suggested COTS software package must be accessible to SSA for at least five (5) years, cost less than $20,000, and satisfy the following requirements: 

General
Simulate the impact of policy changes to SSA's Trust Funds, particularly projecting actuarial balances using a similar methodology to that used by the Office of the Chief Actuary. The model will be used to estimate the effects of policy changes on individuals and the economy and as a comparison for program cost projections made by the Office of the Chief Actuary. Below are listed the various elements we require.

1. Activity One:

Produce 75-year actuarial cost projections (from baseline data ?such as age-gender earnings and gross domestic product --- that is obtained for year 1999) under alternative calculations.  Generate an alternative calculation that literally combines the two Trust Funds (OASI and DI) into a third, theoretical OASDI Trust Fund to produce 75-year actuarial balances.  In addition, upon trust fund exhaustion, two alternative discount rate assumptions should be available: (1) rates based on the return that would be realized given the Trust Fund asset allocation policy for that year and (2) rates based on the assumption that an exhausted Trust Fund will simply borrow at the Treasury bond rate from the Treasury's general fund. 

2. Activity Two:

Specify lifestyle earning profiles for eighteen individuals by birth cohort and simulate a wide variety of OASI program experience statistics for each of them (including the effects of their being married under different policies).  The COTS package must allow model to accept a weighting probability for each individual and combine the eighteen individual statistics into an overall (population-like) statistic.

The COTS model must be able to run in a stochastic-assumption mode and/or an endogenous-growth mode.  The macrosimulation model will also need an embedded cohort model, which uses standard dynamic microsimulation methods with a small, unrepresentative sample of individuals. The cohort model should be embedded inside the macroeconomic model in the sense that the macroeconomic model determines the macroeconomic and demographic environment within which individual lives are simulated.

3. Activity Three:

The COTS macroeconomic model must produce estimates of program income and cost for both OASI and DI and must be able to simulate OASI and DI benefits for individuals and families.

Responses to this announcement must be received within fifteen (15) days after this publication date and should refer to synopsis number 02-1209.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Key West Center (KWC) plans to procure a LABCAT software module for Tumor Measurement and Tracking from Innovative Programming Associates, Inc. 303 Wall Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 421430 and the business size standard is 100 employees.   LABCAT is a suite of separate but intergated software modules designed for the collection, analysis, and reporting of data during the preclinical phases of product development and cancer research.  Using an electronic caliper and a balance that are connected via a serial port to a computer, the LABCAT module for Tumor Measurement and Tracking collects, evaluates, and reports data related to the measurement of external lesions.  Purchase of this equipment will significantly enhance the ability for the laboratory to perform studies involving the role of TGF-B1 and it's target genes in mouse lung carcinogenesis.  The LABCAT module for Tumor Measurement and Tracking has several capabilities, including randomization of animals to groups based on body weights, tumor areas, and tumor volumes, graphical display of tumor locations and sizes, as well as tumor development history, and user-defined data collection schedules.  Along with conventional keyboard/mouse data entry.  The LABCAT software accommodates tumor measurement data capture via Fowler or Mitutoyo electronic calipers, body weight data collection from any RS232-compatible balance, foot pedal control for maximum hands-free data entry, and wireless transmission of data from calipers/balances, in isolettes.  The LABCAT module for Tumor Measurement and tracking encompasses numerous pre-defined reports including protocol data points with error bars, histograms of tumor distributions, regression analysis, and graphical summaries.  Reports also include options for data inclusion according to user-specified criteria, including group, sex, animal identification number, etc., inclusion of one or all tumors for an individual animal, complete statistical analysis options, including descriptive statistics, Duncan, Dunnell, Kruskai-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Newman-Keuls, Scheffe, t-Test, and Tukey, under defined report titles, footnote content, and format control, and export to numerous file formats including MS Word and MS Excel. Innovative Programming Associates, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide a non-comparable computer software capable of performing the operations for which the LABCAT was designed.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to procure a marine craft (Response Boat-Medium (RB-M)) that will provide operational commanders with the capability to meet current and projected multi-mission demand in the coastal environment. Among the multiple missions are Search and Rescue (SAR), Marine Environmental Protection (MEP), Enforcement of Laws and Treaties (ELT), Port Safety and Security (PSS), Defense Operations (DO) and Recreational Boating Safety (RBS). The RB-M project will re-capitalize the capability of the existing multi-mission 41 foot Utility Boats (UTB). The RB-M will also provide some capabilities that exceed those in the existing UTB fleet. The RB-M project will be conducted as a two-phased acquisition. In Phase I, the Coast Guard intends to award three firm-fixed-price contracts for test boats of different designs, but may award fewer or more than three contracts. One of the contracts will be set-aside exclusively for small business. Delivery shall be FOB Destination to the Norfolk VA area within six months of award.  The USCG will test and evaluate each test boat. These test results will be a factor in determining which Phase I contractor who successfully constructed and delivered a test boat will be awarded the production contract in Phase II. Phase II will be a limited competition for one production contract for up to approximately 180 boats over a period of five to ten years. The Phase II contract will also include an option for USCG to obtain technical data rights for the successful design to be used by USCG to build the same type of boat at a USCG facility. The NAICS code is 336612 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The Phase I RFP is planned to be available for download on or about 8 July 2002. The primary Point of Contact for this solicitation, Ms. Linda Bonham, may be contacted via email address lbonham@comdt.uscg.mil.  See Note 2.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) intends to negotiate solely with Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA to furnish, deliver (FOB Destination) and install one (1) applied 4700 MALDI TOF-TOF Mass Spectrometer system for the Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC) Wyndmoor, PA.  This system will be used in a wide variety of research projects where detailed knowledge of plant, animal and microbial proteins, carbohydrates and genes is essential. Protein, carbohydrate and gene sequencing, or the determination of peptide, oligosaccharide and oligonucleotide structure and molecular weight, is critical for biobased products, food safety, prebiotic, dairy, genomics, proteomics and home-land security research projects.  This system's capability of high-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation, high resolution, mass accuracy and sensitivity is critical for identification and quantitative analysis of components of complex biological samples.  The 4700 MALDI TOF-TOF Mass Spectrometer system includes the following salient characteristics: operates in both linear and reflectron modes with a minimum linear TOF path length of 2.0 meters (200 cm) and a minimum 3.0 meter (300 cm) effective path length in reflectron mode; mass accuracy of 5 ppm with internal calibration, or 50 ppm with external calibration;  pulse repetition rate of 20 Hz with maximum pulse width < 3 nanoseconds; and, an acceleration voltage of +25 kV and -20 kV with delayed extraction and low mass filtering.  Operating software is fully integrated to allow desktop control of all relevant instrumental operating parameters.  The proteomics package extracts chemically meaningful knowledge without user intervention and performs database searching for peptide mass fingerprints and/or peptide sequence tags. Companies with demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide and service such equipment must submit a written substantive statement outlining the company's and system's capabilities to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal nor is a solicitation available.

Small Businesses are, however required to comply with this requirement to provide a subcontracting effort.

In determining the acceptability of the proposed plan, the Contracting Officer will evaluate all factors inclusive of an offeror’s past performance with respect to the Offeror’s having awarded  subcontracts for the same or similar products or services to Small Disadvantages business concerns and Women-Owned business concerns.  In order to make this ev aluation, Large Firms are required to submit its past SF 294 (Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts) and SF 295 (Summary Subcontract Reports) forms along with their offer.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only and is a follow-up to a notice posted May 2, 2002 identifying the Department of Justice (DOJ), Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) intent to acquire an integrated, automated information system, which will be known as the United States Entry Exit system.  As previously communicated, DOJ (INS) plans to competitively procure, through full and open competition, the services and supplies required to design, develop, deploy, and support an integrated, automated information system (hereafter referred to as the United States Entry Exit System) to record the arrivals and departures of visitors to/from the United States.  In addition, the INS still intends to issue a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in early June 2002 and a final RFP in late June / early July 2002 timeframe.
The acquisition/procurement strategy for the United States Entry Exit System will encompass three phases: Pre-System Acquisition; System Acquisition; and Production, Deployment, and Sustainment.  In general, the Pre-System Acquisition Phase will occur between June/July 2002 and September/October 2002, and focus on (1) evaluating industry's (i.e., individual vendor/team) technical capability (to include a high-level conceptual design), past performance, and preliminary technical approach/price for designing/developing the United States Entry Exit System based upon a Government-generated Statement of Objectives (SOO) and supporting documentation, and (2) reducing (via a down-selection process) the number of vendors who will then actually develop a preliminary system design and prototype in the System Acquisition Phase.  It is the intent of INS to have at least two competitors enter the System Acquisition Phase. The System Acquisition Phase will occur between September/October 2002 and January/February 2003, and focus on (1) evaluating both preliminary system designs/prototypes and technical/cost proposals for full-scale development, deployment, and initial sustainment based upon a refined SOO and additional supporting documentation (namely, a System "Blueprint" [i.e., "As-Is" and emerging "To-Be" architecture, business processes, and legacy systems] and Functional Requirements Document), and (2) reducing (via a down-selection process) the number of vendors who will then actually conduct full-scale development, deployment, and initial sustainment in the Production, Deployment, and Initial Sustainment Phase.  It is the intent of INS to have one vendor (team) enter the Production, Deployment, and Initial Sustainment Phase.
The Production, Deployment, and Initial Sustainment Phase will occur between January/February 2003 and December 2005, and focus on fulfilling a myriad of legislative/operational requirements.  The former include the Data Management Improvement Act of 2000 [US Code Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, Part IX, Sec. 1365a. Formal name - Integrated entry and exit data system], Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act of 2000 [US Code Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, Part II, Sec. 1187. Formal name - Visa Waiver program for certain visitors], USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 [Public Law No: 107-56, H.R. 3162.  Formal name - Uniting and strengthening America by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism], and Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2002 [Public Law 107-173, H.R. 3525].

<RESPDATE>070102
<CONTACT>Troy Teachey, (202)267-7386
<DESC>On May 1, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced its intention to award a bridge contract to Titan Systems Corporation.  The period of performance of this bridge is such that it will allow the FAA the time necessary to conduct an adequate competition.  In August 2002 the FAA intends to post (in electronic format only) a Screening Information Request requesting offers for the provision of technical support services to assist the Navigation Integrated Product Team (IPT) in the planning, engineering, development, acquisition, implementation, and sustainment of various navigation, landing and lighting systems.  It is the FAA’s expectation that such support will be procured for a base period of three years with two two year options. <P> At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the FAA’s Acquisition Management System (AMS) this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible socially and economically and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA’s 8(a) Program, small businesses (8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. <P> In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information in triplicate from interested vendors: <P> 1.	Capability Statement – This document should identify past performance references for the last 3 years for work performed of a similar type. (Limited to 5 pages) 2.	Resumes – These should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as key personnel in a future proposal to a request for proposals. 3.	Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) 4.	If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent. 5.	Completion of the attached Business Declaration form. 6.	If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. <P> Attached is the present working copy of the Statement of Work for the existing contract with Titan Systems Corporation.  The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance of the follow-on procurement.  Additional work will be required in the new procurement, but it will not be significantly different from the previous requirements.  Also attached is an estimated level of effort by year for the impending contract.  These documents are being provided to give interested vendors a better understanding of the requirements of this procurement.  The major North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these efforts is 541330(Size Standard of $20 Million). <P> This market survey is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment, or a promise to contract by the Government.  This market survey does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses. <P> A vendor’s failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor’s exclusion from the competition. <P> However, the failure of adequate and appropriate 8(a), socially economically disadvantaged, or other small business participation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition.   Please submit your response to this market survey by July 1, 2002.  Responses shall be sent to Troy Teachey, Contracting Officer, Federal Aviation Administration, ASU-310, 800 Independence Ave., S.W., Washington, D.C. 20591. <P>

<DESC>GSA intends to procure on a sole source basis under Simplified Acquisition Procedures a license agreement from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) of Bethesda, Maryland which will grant GSA unlimited rights to use and redistribute within the US Federal Government all CIS Benchmark and Security Analysis Tools.

GSA intends to purchase this license agreement from CIS as a sole source requirement. The authority is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to provide the required license in writing to the identified point of contact within 7 calendar days of this notice. Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis will be based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government.  E-mail.  Jon.Faye@gsa.gov, Telephone number 202-708-6099.

Four identical industry day sessions were held on 16 and 21 May at the Chamber of Commerce in Grand Forks, ND.  Total attendance for the fours sessions was
38 people representing 30 construction and A&E firms.  Note, attendance at any of the sessions was not mandatory for contractors.  The industry sessions were
simply held in order to put out word that MACC is being pursued by Grand Forks AFB, to ascertain contractor interest in MACC, obtain feedback from
contractors on MACC, etc.  If you are interested in obtaining a copy of the attendance rosters please submit your email (no telephonic requests) requesting such to:  
richard.brenamen@grandforks.af.mil
 
A copy of the draft RFP for MACC will be posted to EPS within the next few weeks.  We invite you to review it and provide any feedback concerning it.         
 
 

                                         INFORMATION FEEDBACK/DISCUSSION/DECISIONS

 
 
   - There was considerable discussion concerning design-construction build projects of competitive nature in reference to cost burden on contractors in preparing
   proposals for such.  It was emphasized we will not be doing any large scale projects similar in scope and magnitude to the to new commissary project currently
   being solicited here at Grand Forks AFB.  The anticipated maximum task order for MACC is $2million (minimum $25K) but we anticipate any
   design-construction build projects done being approximately $1/2 to $1 million.
    
    - Regarding the cost to contractors for preparing design-construction build proposals, there was one suggestion to paying a small stipend to each firm who
   submits such offer.  This was discussed but there was also feedback that it is not a ?huge? cost and is simply a cost of doing business, therefore firms should
   accept it.  It?s most likely there would not be such stipend included in MACC although there will likely be a small minimum guarantee to each contractor to help
   offset (albeit minimally) such cost.    Additionally, to further help minimize proposal preparation costs, we would use a phase 1 (would include price) and phase
   II or 15% to 35% & 95% design (what constitutes/defines such would be spelled out in the specifications) design submittal.  Thus, only the selected offeror for
   award would go to submit more detailed designs beyond the initial submittal, while those not selected based on initial submittal would stop there.       
    
   - Another issue concerning design-construction build projects of competitive nature concerned comparing of ?apples to apples? versus ?apples to bananas?.  The
   dilemma in a competitive environment is contractors need to know what the customer wants while at same time it can?t be too detailed/specific or the cost for
   proposal preparation is a burden.  But if the customer?s specs (wants/needs) are not detailed enough (point correctly made by one firm that cost, size, and
   quality determine price) then offers received by the government may not be compared equally in terms of price and/or quality.  No real solution or resolution was
   reached on this issue and one representative from an A&E firms commented that this dilemma is also a continuing challenge in the private sector when doing
   competitive design-construction build.  It?s recognized that we will need to specify a percent for design (e.g. 15% submittal) to minimize design costs but will
   need to be aware ?apples to apples? are compared between competing offers.
    
   - Question arose as to who owns the designs?  Response was the government does if it pays for them.  In response to a concern, the government has no intent to
   incorporate the best features from each design within the final design with the selected awardee on a design-construction build project.
    
   - Payment for construction design build would normally be one lump sum price.
    
   - In reference to use of sub contractors on projects, they would not have to be ?approved? up front as part of the initial MACC award to receive work later on
   under task orders.  While they would need ?approval? on individual task orders, just like on any other construction contract, they do not have to be part of any
   teaming arrangement or joint venture up front.  This was in response to concern from sub contractors they might be locked out of future work.     
    
   - In response to a question concerning performance rating, if a contractor chose not to bid on any task orders we would likely not exercise the next MACC
   option on them but we would not assess them a negative performance rating because of such though (would be assessed ?none? or ?neutral? for MACC
   purposes).
    
   - During these sessions the government expressed its intention was to incorporate one actual (funded and real) seed project that would actually be used for
   MACC award selection purposes and would be awarded up front to the top rated firm based on price, past performance, mission (technical) capability, and
   proposal risk rating.  (Note, the intent is that the three referenced non-price factors will be considered equal in importance and, when combined, considered
   significantly more important than price for award evaluation.)  In reference to using an actual seed project for initial MACC award purposes, contractor
   representatives in one session voted unanimously to instead use a dummy/sample project instead (price is only evaluated as acceptable/fair versus
   unacceptable).  Following a government internal teleconference between Grand Forks AFB and Ellsworth AFB, who just awarded their MACC contract using a
   sample/dummy project, we are now highly considering doing the same here as it may provide the best means to evaluate qualified contractors.
    
   - It was emphasized that many or most of the contractors who are interested in being in the pool of contractors awarded the MACC contract would likely need
   to formally team up or joint venture with other firms.  In order to be considered for MACC award, a construction build only firm would most likely need to team
   up with an A&E to demonstrate design-construction build capability (same for an A&E firm with no construction build experience).  Those construction build
   firms who also perform design most likely would not need to team up or joint venture with another firm.
    
   - At these sessions it was communicated that the intent/hoe was to award MACC to a pool of six to eight contractors, with approximately half the awards
   set-aside for 8(a) contractors.  However, the latest decision is to solicit MACC unrestricted, with 8(a) firms simply competing among all firms for award.  Its
   important to note though that without or without MACC Grand Forks AFB will still be required to meet 8(a) goals, thus projects may be diverted from MACC
   for such purposes to offer to 8(a) contractors.  Should this change and MACC is set-aside for some 8(a) contractors, in accordance with Federal Acquisition
   Regulation (FAR) part 19.1102 there would not be a 10% evaluation factor for award purposes on individual task orders.      
    
   - Concern was expressed by several sub contractor/specialized type firms (e.g. electrical, mechanical, HVAC, etc.) that one MACC is in place they would not
   be aware of nearly as many sub contracting opportunities as projects estimated greater than $25K and procured through MACC are not synopsized.  It was
   suggested that once MACC is awarded perhaps projects when procured could be provided to them or posted so they are aware of the sub contracting
   opportunities available and can ?knock on the doors? of the primes.  This will be taken into consideration.
    
   - As previously stated, it is intended to provide a minimum guarantee (possibly $5K) over the life of the contract to each MACC contractors.  In reference to off
   setting costs most contractors expressed this is peanuts essentially, while a few stated every little bit helps.  Available funding is the issue here as to the amount (if
   any) is guaranteed. 
    
   - It was noted that MACC is intended to compliment or supplement SABER.  There is a SABER contract at Grand Forks AFB and current plans are to
   exercise the remaining options on it.  The purpose of MACC is to allow for quicker contract execution (in comparison to longer lead time to execute contracts
   on the open market) as oftentimes sorely needed dollars are offered by command but pulled and used elsewhere if award cannot be executed within required
   timelines.  And in comparison to SABER it is hoped that pricing will be slightly more competitive as contractors will be competing for individual task orders. 
   Another added benefit is award of individual task orders under MACC can also be based in part on performance.        
    
   - It?s anticipated that our MACC template RFP will be posted on line at EPS.GOV by the end of June ?02.  Contractors are invited to review it and provide to
   this office any feedback, suggestions, criticisms, etc.  We intend to issue the actual RFP in Aug ?02 and are shooting for Jan ?03 award.  This timetable is
   preliminary though and may change depending on several factors.
