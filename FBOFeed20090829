This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Symantec Veritas Netbackup.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/DO requires Netbackup 6.5 licenses as they are used to support the new Classnet system.  It includes storage licensing for the 5 TB virtual tape library as well as the current M1500 physical DLT tape library that will be in use at CSTs offsite copies.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Symantec Veritas Netbackup is the only effective license and support for the system.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY - This is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funded acquisition entitled "Agassis Biomass Landscape Fuels Reduction".  The work to be performed is for helicopter application of herbicide on 175 acres within the Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge.  Receipt of this award is contingent on the contractor's meeting the requirements in Section 1512 of the Recovery Act, i.e. reports on use of funds.
Work includes, but is not limited to, the furnishing of chemicals and performing commercial aerial spraying of herbicide to control secondary tree and scrub regrowth for purposes of reducing woody vegetation and to promote the growth of grasses within the Open Landscape Management Area of Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge.  This work is to reduce fire intensity and reduce smoke management concerns when prescribed fire treatments are scheduled for these areas. The tree and brush regeneration are associated with logging and brush mowing.  The regeneration will vary from 2 to 5 feet in height.  The Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge is located 23 miles NE of Thief River Falls, MN.  Open Landscape Management Area, within the refuge, is located 6 miles east of the refuge headquarters.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The critical time period of performance for this work is between August 17, 2009 and September 18, 2009, OR DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD IN 2010.  Due to the variability of the first frost, the spraying end date in September could be reduced or lengthened.  
This procurement is issued as a 100% set-aside for small business concerns under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 115112 "Soil Preparation, Planting, and Cultivating", which has a corresponding small business size standard of $7.0 million.

<DESC>The VA Network 22 Logistic Office intends to negotiate a sole source procurement in accordance with FAR Part 13 with University of California, San Diego, under authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Department of Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS)  is procuring a Disaster Emergency Preparedness training program developed in the internet based online 3D Multiuser Virtual Learning Environment of "Second Life". The training program will be used to augment our current training efforts and shall provide the ability to do realistic drills for natural and manmade disasters in a virtual town and a large hospital with inpatient wards and alternative health care facilities. The contractor will be able to provide training and simulation laboratories within easy access (i.e. within 5 minutes walking distance of the VASDHS main hospital). Due to the various work schedules of clinical staff, our trainees will often be using the training labs in the evenings and on weekends. Therefore, it is required that the training labs and simulation center be available both during regular hours and during after-hours for individual and group learning sessions. Additionally, a very important aspect of the University of California, San Diego training program is the expertise of their unique multidisciplinary team which includes experts in curriculum development and medical training using simulators and with creating customized online curricula and learning management systems that meet the needs for training healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, medical students, EMT's). This is the only service that is compatible with the current VA system. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements by submitting their request in writing with complete name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and a point of contact.  The Government will consider all quotes received by 12:00 AM (PST), September 7, 2009.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, email, or facsimile at 562-961-1373. Point of contact is Amanda Bartman.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W9133L09R0045.

INTENT
The National Guard Bureau (Guard), Arlington, VA, intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the Contractor proposing the best value solution to fulfill the needs of the Government.

ACQUISITON OBJECTIVE
The objective of this acquisition is to obtain a man-portable, multi-band system that can receive in real time and transmit in near real time.

The ideal system shall receive, simultaneously from multiple sources, full motion video, imagery, and other sensory data.  Through the use of compression technology and digital content management solutions, the system will capture, standardize, process and fuse video, images and data input and securely transmit that product to all users.  The system will have the ability to provide (real-time) video, digital imagery, and other sensory data directly to end users and, more importantly, transmit that data with minimal latency.  

The system will be a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) turn-key system that can receive and transmit analog and digital signals from all types of sensors.  The receiver system must be built to withstand extreme and/or austere environments (natural disasters and national emergencies) and man-portable (light-weight and mobile).  The proposed receiver system must operate independently of local infrastructure and be compatible with SATCOM, the Global Broadcast System or existing local T1 connection.  

BACKGROUND:
The National Guard conducts real-time video assessment and digital imagery collection for a host of users including incident commanders, first-responders, state and local leadership, federal partners and national-level leadership including the President.  Real-time full motion video (FMV) that can be processed, exploited, and distributed (PED) is widely considered the best operational intelligence support available for effectively deploying forces and responding to continually evolving circumstances during a crisis.  

The product resulting from this award will improve the Guards ability to effectively and efficiently collect video signals from the array of available aerial imagery collectors and disseminate those images to incident commanders in a domestic environment.  As demonstrated by hurricanes in Louisiana and wild fires in California, a shared understanding of a situation is critical to effective emergency response.

<DESC>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of Air and Marine Operations currently occupies warehouse and boatyard space under a lease in St. Augustine, Florida, that will be expiring.  CBP is seeking to lease approximately 27,000 square feet of warehouse space and 53,000 square feet of boatyard storage space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 26,542 contiguous ANSI/BOMA warehouse area square feet (OASF) and 52,447 ANSI/BOMA boatyard storage area square feet.

Other applicable requirements include:

Adjacent to CBP owned National Marine Support Center located at 6100-B U.S. Highway 1 N
Sole tenancy by CBP
On site Parking for 50 vehicles 


U.S. Customs and Border Protection is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  CBP will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, CBP will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy our requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Contract for the services and supplies listed below.  The requirement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5 Test Program.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a 100% Small Business Set Aside.
  
The solicitation number is 09-222-SOL-00147.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-36, August 11, 2009.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541380 Testing Laboratories; Small Business Size Standard is $12 Million.

The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting for the following Scope of Work:

Gene Sequencing

The Division of Personalized Nutrition and Medicine (DPNM) at the FDA National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), in Jefferson, AR, requires sequence analyses of genomic DNA from about 230 individuals. Analyses must use a next-generation sequencer with read lengths no less than 50 base pairs. 

About 400 selected genes including exons, introns and 15kb 5'-UTR and 10kb 3'-UTR (approximately 50kilobases per gene) must be sequenced at 30X coverage.

DPNM will be responsible for capturing/enriching these genes so the sequencer provider will not provide gene capture/enrichment services.  A DNA library must be generated by the service provider.

Post-capture sequencing supplies, labor costs, post-sequencing analyses of genetic variations including SNPs, insertions, deletions, and other genetic variations (using publicly-available sources) for each individual should be  included in your proposal. 

	Deliverables

To provide to the FDA, DNA sequence data from the about 400 genes, to be selected by DPNM, (exons, 5 and 3 flanking sequences) from exons captured from ~ 230 individuals, including a list of genetic variants derived from sequenced samples. 


Period of Performance

The estimated time frame for completion of this project is 4 months.       
	
An official authorized to bind the Offeror must sign the terms and conditions of the offer.  Offerors that fail to furnish required representations and certifications, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration.

<DESC>The Department of State Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) is tasked to lead, coordinate and institutionalize U.S. Government civilian capacity to prevent or prepare for post-conflict situations, and to help stabilize and reconstruct societies in transition from conflict or civil strife, so they can reach a sustainable path toward peace, democracy and a market economy. 
A consensus has developed within the Executive Branch, in Congress and among independent experts that the U.S. Government needs a more robust capability to prevent conflict when possible, and if necessary manage stabilization and reconstruction operations in countries emerging from conflict or civil strife. In July 2004, Congress authorized the reprogramming of funds to create the State Department's Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS). Ambassador John E. Herbst was named Coordinator in 2006, and reports directly to the Secretary of State.  Charged with this mission, S/CRS requires personnel to provide daily and on-call maintenance and analysis of Information Technology (IT) Technical Support, Knowledge Management, Strategic and Tactical Planning, and Network Engineering Services for the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization in support of various connections and collaborations with DOD  JFCOM, COCOMs, USAID, and all other USG Agencies and Non-Government organizations on Communications and Collaboration Information Technology activities relating to all reconstruction and stabilization activities.  Contractor personnel working under this task will work closely with the S/ES/IRM, AF/EX/IRM, IRM Bureau and other Department of State providers of IT support.

Under the directions and guidance of the Resource Management Director, contract personnel will provide support to all members of the staff of S/CRS to further the technological means of communications with other Executive Agency partners in the areas of Information Technology (IT) Technical Support, Knowledge Management, Strategic and Tactical Planning, and Network Engineering Services.

The Contractor shall be responsible personnel to provide daily and on-call maintenance and analysis of Information Technology (IT) Technical Support, Knowledge Management, Strategic and Tactical Planning, and Network Engineering Services for the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization in support of various connections and collaborations with DOD  JFCOM, COCOMs, USAID, and all other USG Agencies and Non-Government organizations on Communications and Collaboration Information Technology activities relating to all reconstruction and stabilization activities.  Contractor personnel working under this task will work closely with the S/ES/IRM, AF/EX/IRM, IRM Bureau and other Department of State providers of IT support.

It is intended that this requirement be solicited as a 100% Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business set-aside.  The National American Individual Classification Standard (NAICS) code procurement is 541513.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will require the submission of a technical proposal and a price proposal.  The award shall be made to the contractor whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  This means that the offerors Technical/Management Solutions/Approach, key personnel and resumes and past performance together are more significant than cost.  The work under this contract will be classified as SECRET.  All personnel performing on the contract must favorably possess a secret clearance at time of award and maintain a clearance at the level of secret for the duration of the contract.

<DESC><p>29 Aug 09 - The purpose of this mod is to add questions and answers.
<p>1. After reading through the paperwork that was attached, I noticed that there was mention of the department already owning a LS9-32. Do they own only one or do they already own two LS9-32 consoles? <br />Answer: We own 2 LS9 - 32 consoles.</p>
<p>2. The reason I ask is that while the LS9-32 is compatible with the 32x16 Snake SB kit, the<br />LS9-16 is not. <br />Answer: We would only use the first box of the sb16es snake for use with the LS9 - 16. This allows us to use the snake for either LS9 - 16 or LS9 - 32 consol or both at the same time; thus the complete versatility of the snake and system.</p>
<p>3. The reason for this is that the 32x16 kit requires two card slots and there is only one card slot on the LS9-16. the LS9-16 is fully compatible with the 16x8 stagebox kit.<br />Answer: We understand this and that is why we only one box with the LS9 - 16.</p>

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/DO requires Netbackup 6.5 licenses as they are used to support the new Classnet system.  It includes storage licensing for the 5 TB virtual tape library as well as the current M1500 physical DLT tape library that will be in use at CSTs offsite copies.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Symantec Veritas Netbackup is the only effective license and support for the system.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Amendment  1  extended due date for questions and proposal submission.  For more information, please download the solicitation.


INTENT
The National Guard Bureau (Guard), Arlington, VA, intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the Contractor proposing the best value solution to fulfill the needs of the Government.

ACQUISITON OBJECTIVE
The objective of this acquisition is to obtain a man-portable, multi-band system that can receive in real time and transmit in near real time.

The ideal system shall receive, simultaneously from multiple sources, full motion video, imagery, and other sensory data.  Through the use of compression technology and digital content management solutions, the system will capture, standardize, process and fuse video, images and data input and securely transmit that product to all users.  The system will have the ability to provide (real-time) video, digital imagery, and other sensory data directly to end users and, more importantly, transmit that data with minimal latency.  

The system will be a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) turn-key system that can receive and transmit analog and digital signals from all types of sensors.  The receiver system must be built to withstand extreme and/or austere environments (natural disasters and national emergencies) and man-portable (light-weight and mobile).  The proposed receiver system must operate independently of local infrastructure and be compatible with SATCOM, the Global Broadcast System or existing local T1 connection.  

BACKGROUND:
The National Guard conducts real-time video assessment and digital imagery collection for a host of users including incident commanders, first-responders, state and local leadership, federal partners and national-level leadership including the President.  Real-time full motion video (FMV) that can be processed, exploited, and distributed (PED) is widely considered the best operational intelligence support available for effectively deploying forces and responding to continually evolving circumstances during a crisis.  

The product resulting from this award will improve the Guards ability to effectively and efficiently collect video signals from the array of available aerial imagery collectors and disseminate those images to incident commanders in a domestic environment.  As demonstrated by hurricanes in Louisiana and wild fires in California, a shared understanding of a situation is critical to effective emergency response.
