<a href="mailto:jason.patterson@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>The Air Force intends to procure a Korean National Airspace System (KNAS) Simulator and a Korean Automated Protocol Exchanger (KAPEX) and a Korean Flight Data Input/Output (KFDIO). The KNAS consists of a software/hardware solution that will simulate the Korean National Air Space environment with the intent of increasing air traffic efficiency. The KAPEX is a protocol converter that translates and processes air trafficcontrol (ATC) flight plan and radar handoff messages between the US built Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) used at Department of Defense ATC facilities in Korea and the Korean air traffic control facilities. The simulator will be used for testing KAPEX with STARS in the US.
     The KFDIO function is to print flight plans on a flight strip printer. In addition to this output of flight plans via the printer, the KFDIO will also allow controllers to create local flight plans, make changes to existing flight plans, and create what are referred to as stereo flight plans, or "canned" flight plans. The KFDIO System is comprised of the software necessary to process flight data, a personal computer with monitor, peripheral input devices, and printer.
           The above will require design experience on DoD/FAA contracts in Air Traffic Control message transfer functions. Specifically the following experience is required: 1. Air Traffic Control (ATC) flight plan and radar handoff message processing software development. 2. Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) Inter-Facility Data Transfer synchronous serial interface and protocol driver development. 3. STARS digital radar data input synchronous serial interface and protocol driver development. 4. Real-time ATC message and radar track simulator software development. 5. Enroute message computer identifier (CID) and terminal message CID dynamic substitution software development. 6. Graphical user interface software development. 7. Radar track and latitude/longitude data display software development. There is incidental Technical Support and Travel to be included in this procurement. This buy is NOT Foreign Military Sales. Companies with the above experienc! e are invited to submit their qualifications to the buyer, Michael Cunningham at Michael.Cunningham@hanscom.af.mil, (781) 377-2231 for technical issues contact the Program Manager Lt. Jason Patterson at Jason.Patterson@hanscom.af.mil, 603 377-9019.

The Motorola XTL5000 mobile radio has direct day to day communications between E&E and EAC members abroad.  These radios are used in all types of climate areas around the world from humid, very hot, to extreme cold conditions.  Although Motorola makes a very good product, over a period of time with frequent usage, the control heads beigin to malfunction or just fail to operate for proper communications.  The control head that comes with the XTL5000 mobile only comes in kit form, thus the need to purchase spare control heads.  This product features all of the specifications required by the Radio Programs Branch, and provides maximum interoperability with equipment and procedures already in place.<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>David Reynolds, 202-385-8658

<a href="mailto:David.L.Reynolds@faa.gov">David.L.Reynolds@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The FAA has an emerging requirement for a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) to extend the service life of the current Low Level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS). Concurrently, the FAA is considering the viability of newly emerging technology as an alternative approach to provide a requirements solution for LLWAS.
As part of the FAA Lifecycle Management Process - Concept and Requirements Definition, the FAA is completing a study of the current wind shear detection systems to determine which systems offer the best compromise of operational supportability, improved reliability, easing maintainability and reducing ownership costs. 
This market survey will be used to determine the range of vendor interest, experience and capability, and solicit feedback that will aid the FAA in defining the LLWAS requirements and how best to structure an acquisition strategy. The following serve as LLWAS system characteristics interested industry participants are hereby asked to address in their response to this market survey: 
	Extending the service life of the existing LLWAS systems or utilizing an alternative emerging technology, or a combination of SLEP/Emerging Technology system. 	Providing for improved reliability and easier maintenance over existing system performance	Reducing cost of ownership over existing system	Utilizing COTS and non-proprietary, non-COTS hardware and software to the maximum extent possible	Using an open system architecture that provides seamless portability to next generation technology and maximizes commonality of components between the various LLWAS systems	If industry provides for an emerging technology approach the requirements solution must address the final development, test, production, delivery, and installation of equipment	If industry provides a SLEP approach the requirements solution must address the applicable testing requirements  
Interested venders should send a capabilities statement no longer than 20 pages in length addressing the aforementioned LLWAS system characteristics in addition to the following: 
	Provide a synopsis of experience with LLWAS or similar technologies, with particular focus on system design, modification, and support	Provide a synopsis of experience developing, modifying, or implementing major hardware, software, or firmware in support of LLWAS or other wind shear alert systems  	Provide a synopsis of experience in updating complex systems for technology insertion
Should the FAA proceed to announce its interest in acquiring LLWAS the FAA may decide to set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible economically disadvantaged small businesses that are certified by the small business administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.  
Please fill out the attached business declaration form indicating your type of business (Small, SDV, 8(a), etc.). 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR OFFER. THE FAA WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY COSTS RELATED TO RESPONDING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Government will not use this as a screening device for any such future requests. Interested vendors should provide the capabilities statements via email to the contracting officer at: David.L.Reynolds@FAA.gov. They may also be provided to the following address:
Federal Aviation Administration600 Independence Ave. S.W.Washington, DC 20591Attn: David L. Reynolds 4W32HS  Tel. no. (202)385-8658
Email replies preferred. Replies to this market survey are requested by close of business on March 16th, 2009. Questions regarding this market survey may be directed to the FAA person of contact at the above address and phone number.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Olympus America, Inc., Center Valley, PA, for the purchase of fluorescence components for an existing Olympus Model BX-41 Microscope.

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in 

(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or

(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The Ceramics Division at NIST currently uses an Olympus BX-41 for Fluorescence Microscopy for their experimental setup.  To expand the capability of NISTs existing Olympus BX-41 Microscope, the Ceramics Division requires fluorescence components.  Olympus components are required in order to maintain consistency and compatibility with the Divisions existing microscope.  The specifications (material of manufacture, magnification and numerical aperture, and the RFA that includes two laser ports) for each of the objectives are critical to NISTs measurements, which will enable NIST to quantify the fluidity of fluorescent labels in lipid bilayers, and to capture fluorescent images from the existing Olympus microscope.  Olympus America, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the components that is required to satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by February 10, 2009, 3:30 p.m. EST.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Biochemical Science Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, for the purchase of a GENEMAPPER ID-X Software V1.1 in order to upgrade an existing ABI 3130 DNA Capillary Electrophoresis Instrument.

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in 

(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST Applied Genetics Group currently utilizes an ABI 3130 DNA Capillary Electrophoresis Instrument which is used for a project involving the interpretation of DNA mixtures as well as DNA data anlaysis.  The GENEMAPPER ID-X v1.1 software is necessary to continue forensic DNA testing research by the NIST Applied Genetics Group concerning analysis of data collected by Applied Biosystems 3130x1 Capillary Electrophoresis Instrument.  GeneMapper ID-X is an automated genotyping software solution for forensic casework and databasing that contains a mixture analysis tool that is unique to this software.  In addition, the software must include a seamless proprietary transition of data from data collection to analysis and interpretation and the capability of opening Applied Biosystems generated data files (.fsa).  Therefore, the required software must be 100 percent compatible with the existing instrument.  Applied Biosystems is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the GENEMAPPER ID-X V1.1 Software, which is required to satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis Sage-N Research, Incorporated, 226 Airport Parkway Suite 638, San Jose, CA, 95110, for a Sorcerer 2 Integrated Data Appliance System (IDA). The Current Unit used has a Sorcerer 1 system that needs to be upgraded to keep up with the number as well as the size of data files generated by the two modern mass spectrometers. The upgrade will greatly diminish the time required for data analysis post data acquisition. Currently the Sorcerer 2 IDA is only available through Sage-N Research, Inc. <br />The NIA assists Intramural Research Program investigators on mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses of biological samples. One of the services offered by the NIA is LC-MS/MS analysis of biological samples using the LTQ-ETD or LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer, which routinely generates spectral data files over 5-50 MB each (5,000 to 10,000 spectra). These files need to be processed through a database searching engine using algorithms such as the SEQUEST software program, to identify proteins and/or posttranslational modifications. Due to the large data size, each data file search may take more than 1-2 hours for simple protein identification and more than 3-5 hours for posttranslational analysis on a desktop computer. <br />The Sorcerer 2 IDA system is a plug and play, fully integrated, high-throughput data analysis system suitable for analyzing 100,000's to millions of tandem mass spectra from ion trap mass spectrometers, particularly LTQ, LTW-Orbitrap, and LTQ-FT instruments. <br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI878136 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892-2080, and Attention: Idella M.

<DESC>THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN INTENT TO AWARD ON A NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS TO HDR ALASKA, INC.
REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL FOR THE REQUIRED SERVICES WILL BE SENT AFTER 27 FEBRUARY 2009.
NO RESPONSE IS REQUIRED FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
SERVICES NEEDED:  The Alaska Regional Office of the National Park Service (NPS) wishes to retain HDR Alaska, Inc., (HDR) to complete design development and construction document services for wastewater treatment and disposal as well as the rehabilitation of the collection system for Denali National Park Frontcountry area.  HDR has completed the preliminary work of site investigation and schematic phases of the project.  NPS deemed it reasonable to continue with HDR as the contractor, since it had the historical memory and data from its previous satisfactory work, and therefore solicited a proposal for the design development and construction document services phase under an existing and previously utilized A-E IDIQ contract.  HDR submitted its proposal for the award of a task order under its IDIQ contract when a government administrative error intervened and stopped the process.  After the error had been detected and corrected, utilization of the IDIQ contract was no longer possible.  After due consideration of project factors including estimated cost, previous history (experience with the project), familiarity with the known data, and time constraints, the decision was made to award a contract to HDR for the completion of the design development and construction document services phase on a non-competitive basis as a follow-on contract.  The proposed project will construct a new wastewater treatment facility to replace the existing aerated lagoon system.  The location of the new facility will be within the general vicinity of the existing lagoon.  The wastewater treatment facility will be designed to handle the projected 20 year design domestic wastewater flows for summer and winter use from the Frontcountry Development and to treat all of the concentrated truck-hauled wastes from the Park's septic tanks and vault toilets.  (It will be assumed that all chemical toilets will be replaced with vault toilet type of facilities prior to the operation of this facility under a separate project).  The new wastewater treatment facility will be capable of winter shut down as well as winter treatment of low flows.  This project will also rehabilitate the existing wastewater collection system.  The rehabilitation of the existing wastewater collection system will correct all reverse grades and inadequate manhole connections.  The un-permitted seasonal lagoon will be abandoned and regraded to original lines and grades.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to solicit on an other than full and open competition basis a requirement for a military-focused resiliency-building family services program to serve armed forces families at various Naval, Marine Corps, and Seabee locations.  This is the continuation of a pilot program being conducted by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (PH/TBI) office, along with the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Community Health (CCH), to explore best practices in psychological health for Sailors, Marines, and their families.  The services include Group Level Briefings for Pre- and Post-Deployment military and family, Individual Consultations, Skill-Building Sessions for Families, and Multi-Session Family Interventions.  The services also include consultation to military staff, schools, families, and community ! on parenting and combating stress, traumatic grief, and other deployment-related stresses.  The solicitation will be for a base period of performance beginning on 11 June 2009 through 10 June 2010, with four (4) one-year renewal option periods. The NAICS code is 624190 and the Service Code is G099.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.
This procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Government announces the intent to contract directly with the UCLA for this requirement.  UCLA is currently providing the same services to military families located at Naval Special Warfare (NSW) (Coronado and Little Creek Bases, and Port Hueneme), Marine Corps (Camps Pendleton and Lejeune, Hawaii and Okinawa Bases, and 29 Palms), and SeaBee (Gulfport Base) units under a program called "Project FOCUS (Families OverComing Under Stress).  A sole source follow-on contract with UCLA is in the best interest of the Government, as any other source would result in a duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfillment of the requirement.  
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by the specified response date.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.

<a href="mailto:Scott.Elaine@.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334220   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to award a sole source purchase order to the current provider, The Satellite Center Inc. located in Florence, KY forthe continuation of Direct TV services and the installation of additional receivers to EPA's National Decontamination Team (NDT) facility located in Erlanger, KY.  The NDT provides scientific, engineering and technical expertise to the hazardous materials response community.  The Erlanger facility also serves as a COOP location for the EPA in Cincinnati.  To support these two functions effectively, the facility must be able to monitor activities on a national basis. 
To accomplish this task, the NDT requires satellite television service at the Erlanger facility.  To meet this need, in 2007, EPA requested competitive bids for installation of equipment and satellite television service for the Erlanger facility.  Satellite Center Inc. was the successful bidder which furnished and installed equipment including dishes, receivers, cables, splitters, switches, etc. for standard definition receivers in twelve of the offices located within the facility.  This enabled the Erlanger office to begin receiving programming services.  Satellite Center Inc, also activated and provided subscription for monthly Direct TV satellite programming, customer education, troubleshooting assistance for problems encountered with service for all installed equipment to users.
The existing equipment includes dishes, receivers, cables, splitters, switches, etc. for standard definition receivers in twelve offices within the EPA Erlanger, KY location.  This service is used daily.  Competing these requirements and potentially awarding to an alternative source would not prove in the Government's best interest or prove a best value to the Government.  To do this would cause undue hardship to the agency and the community and would require removal of existing equipment and the installation of new equipment and service.  Uninterrupted service is essential to meeting the needs of the emergency response community and re-installation of equipment and service could cause significant down time during National Security Events which would render the facility incapable of meeting the Agency's homeland security mission.  If there are any other potential sources who could provide the same services without the further installation of new equipment, uninterrupted service and additional expense to the Government, submit your capability statement via email to the US Environmental Protection Agency c/o Elaine Scott at scott.elaine@epa.gov no later than 2PM, EST February 3, 2009.  NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE!!

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The resulting contracts will be for a base period of one year with four one year options.  The range of estimated total cost for the base year plus four option years is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 for the Philpott Lake Project and between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 for the W.

Technical is more important than Past Performance.  The Technical factor is comprised of two (2) sub-factors:  Soundness of Approach and Management.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electric distribution (NAICS 221122), water distribution (NAICS 221310), and wastewater collection (NAICS 221320) utility systems at Minot Air Force Base (AFB), North Dakota.    Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2688  Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electric, water, and wastewater utility systems at Minot AFB, North Dakota, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter Notice) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 3:00 pm EST on Friday, December 19, 2008.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Governments use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the February 2009 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

Installation Description

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The overhead electrical system was built in the early 1950s. Seventy percent of the distribution system is now underground. New construction is direct-buried duct, but older underground was direct buried. Even though a housing replacement project is underway, the designer (Design-Build Contract) chose to leave this cable instead of replacing it in the project. In about 5 years, some problems with this cable could begin, since 25 years is the approximate life of underground systems. Other short runs of overhead have been placed underground, allowing for renovation of some secondary lines. Two substations, North Substation and South Substation, provide power to Minot AFB. Two switching stations assist in distribution of power through the base. North Substation has a 15 megavolt amps (MVA) capacity and incoming feeder is 41.6 kilovolt (kV). South Substation has a 30 MVA capacity, with two 41.6 kV parallel feeders supplying this substation. Base demand is about 15 MVA. In 2004, South Substation's capacity was increased. Incoming feeders and high sides of transformers and switchgear are owned and maintained by Central Power Electrical Cooperative, while the low sides of transformers and 12.47 kV switchgear is owned and maintained by Verendrye Electrical Cooperative. Six circuits are fed from South Substation and four circuits are fed from North Substation. Of the four circuits from North Substation, three are housing circuits and one is dedicated to the hospital. The average burial depth of ducts and direct buried cables in the Main Base area is 3-4. This is true of all areas of the base including Flight Line, MSA, WSA, East Housing, and West Housing. The primary metering at the substations is located up stream of the Government identified PODs. The meters are owned and maintained by the Utility supplier. Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are: Airfield Lighting, Emergency Power Generators, Parking lots and pedestrian pathway lighting fed off the building internal source, and the WSA area. 

  The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The water distribution system consists of approximately 52 linear miles of pipe. Pipe materials that are located within the distribution system are asbestos cement, ductile iron, cast iron, steel, copper, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Tracer wire is not located on new non-metallic pipes, except for a stretch of pipe thats less than a mile. Pipe sizes range from 1 inch to 16 inches.  The average burial depth in both of the housing areas is approximately 8 ft deep. All other area across the base including the flight line and the WSA has an average burial depth of 11 to 12 ft deep. Water is supplied to the Minot AFB by the City of Minot water treatment plant (WTP). The current sources of water for the City of Minot are the Sundre Aquifer and the Minot Aquifer. The point where government takes ownership of the pipe lines approximately 11 miles south of the installation. The transmission line contains approximately seven miles of ductile iron, and four miles of PVC pipe. The 14 inch pipe enters into the installation just to the south. This is the only entry point for the water system. Potable water enters into the installation treated, and there is no chlorination facility located on the installation. There are a total of three pump stations: one potable and two non-potable. A SCADA system has been put in place at the only potable water pump station. The other two non-potable pump stations do not have a SCADA system set up. When chlorine levels are low, the SCADA system alerts base personnel, who then alert the City of Minot WTP to increase chlorine levels. There are six (6) potable water storage tanks located on the installation: four (4) elevated, two (2) underground tanks. The total capacity of the storage tanks is 3.3 million gallons (MG). Telemetry has also been installed with the tanks. There are two additional non-potable tanks that are installed on the flight line and the Weapons Storage Area (WSA). Cathodic protection has been added to a majority of the valves and fire hydrants. The anodes and test stations are in adequate working order. None of the pipes located in the water distribution system has any cathodic protections on the lines. The inventory listed below in Table 1 also includes the family military housing units. Minot AFB has approximately 26 acres of easements associated with the main transmission line.  These easements will be transferred upon sale of the water system.  Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are,  Irrigation systems and Non-potable fire systems.


The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

All domestic and industrial wastewater generated at Minot AFB is collected via a network of an estimated 268,400 linear feet of piping constructed of vitrified clay, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), ductile iron, asbestos cement, concrete, and cast iron. The collection system consists of collection mains, precast manholes, and sewage lift stations.  The collection mains range in size from 1.5 to 24 inches in diameter and are buried at a base-wide average depth of 12 feet. Tracer wire is not included with the non-metallic components. A series of sewage lift stations and associated force mains are located throughout the installation to pump wastewater through the collection system where gravity flow is not possible. There is no separate industrial wastewater system.  Industrial wastewater effluent from the aircraft and missile operations, maintenance areas and the industrial areas flows into the sanitary sewer system after being processed through oil/water separators. All collected wastewater flows to the sewage treatment lagoons located in the northern part of the base. Minot AFB operates a series of stabilization lagoons to treat its wastewater. The stabilization system is comprised of two sets of three facultative lagoons each for a total of six lagoons. Wastewater is discharged to the lagoons where it flows by gravity or is pumped through the lagoon cells, and organic matter is allowed to decompose or settle out. The total surface area of the lagoons is approximately 311 acres with a storage capacity of approximately 345 million gallons. To increase capacity, stabilized wastewater is typically released from the final lagoon in each set twice a year, in the spring and fall, as necessary. The flow from the stabilization lagoons is discharged off base through three permitted outfalls. Minot AFB was issued a North Dakota Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NDPDES) Permit, No. ND-0020486 by the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH), Division of Water Quality in July 2004. This permit authorizes Minot AFB to discharge stabilized wastewater from the treatment lagoons to unnamed tributaries of Egg Creek through Outfalls 003, 001, and 011.  There are six other outfalls (004, 005, 006, 007, 008, and 009); however, the permit states that there shall be no discharges from these outfalls except for emergency bypasses in accordance with the permit.  Minot AFB has approximately 140 Acres of easements associated with the discharge of the lagoons.  These easements will be transferred upon sale of the wastewater collection system. Specifically excluded from the wastewater system privatization are Oil / Water Separators (OWS), Grease Traps, and Storm sewers.

<DESC>GENERAL:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, is conducting a sources sought for the work described below.  This notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  The amount of interest will determine the possibility of a set-aside or full and open competition.  This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  NPS would like interested parties to submit related project experience and resumes for key individuals to Rebecca Bizier at Rebecca_Bizier@nps.gov, or via fax to 303-987-6646 by close of business Tuesday, February 10, 2009.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Work will include analysis of existing conditions, cleaning of existing historic concrete,  replacement-in-kind of portions of historic concrete including but not limited to pavements, stairs, curbs, walls, cornices, benches, patching/repair of spalls and delaminations at concrete elements with an exposed aggregate finish, replication or repair of concrete piers and decorative elements (urns, balusters, obelisks, fountain elements, water spouts, handrails, coping and other pre-formed objects and decorative elements), creation of molds from extant or portions of extant features, repair of concrete with imbedded elements, and repair of cracks in historic concrete.  This would require replication, creation, and/or analysis of concrete mixes as required.  Repair of modern concrete that is incidental to the historic concrete is also included.  NAICS 238110 Concrete Repair.
Work will potentially occur throughout the National Capital Region.  The National Capital Region (Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, and West Virginia) contains more than 700 individual sites, ranging from community parks that serve as neighborhood gathering places to national monuments that attract visitors from around the world. Serving more than 40 million visitors annually, the parks of the National Capital Region encompass more than 87,000 acres of parkland and open space with thousands of historic structures and archeological sites, hundreds of miles of trails, bike paths, riverfront, scenic parkways, and historic canals. The National Capital Region also offers visitors numerous statues, presidential memorials, historic forts, Civil War battlefields, and the White House. Despite ongoing repair and maintenance these sites continue to have large amounts of deteriorated exposed aggregate retaining walls, paving, and steps remaining and deterioration of walls and paving continues. The National Park Service (NPS) seeks interest from experts in the concrete industry capable of providing expert advice, formula development services, and ongoing repair of the decorative concrete.  
In some cases formulas for the concrete mixes for repair have been developed, but the Park has varied concrete within and additional mixes and formulas may need to be developed to match the historic concrete in the color, texture, frequency of specific aggregate colors and size of the historic concrete aggregate and matrix, including, when possible, using materials from the original quarries.  There are slight variations in the same mix for the concrete in different locations; therefore, some adjustment must be made to create samples to match specific locations. Work may include submitting alternate design mixtures when characteristics of materials, project conditions, weather, test results or other circumstances warrant adjustments. Work may include replacement of portions of concrete pavements and stairs, patch repair of spalls (missing, damaged or deteriorated locations) and delaminations at concrete elements with an exposed aggregate finish, and replication or repair of concrete piers and decorative elements, providing steel reinforcement where necessary. Spalls are both shallow and deep, deep spalls being those which have exposed rebar within the spalled area and shallow spalls those with no visible reinforcing (prior to cleaning and preparation for repair). Some repairs may require injection grout and/or repair mortar.  Repair of modern concrete that is incidental to the historic concrete is also included.
EXAMPLE OF WORK: Meridian Hill Park is located in Washington, D.C. approximately one and one-half miles north of the White House.  It is one of Washington's most important and historic parks in the tradition of the monumental, federal parks of the Mall. Bounded by 16th Street on the west, Euclid Street on the north, 15th Street on the east and W Street on the south, Meridian Hill Park is located within a diverse and changing neighborhood. Originally envisioned as "a classical villa landscape at the center of a vibrant and interesting residential neighborhood", the park continues to play an important role in the physical as well as social landscape of the neighborhood. Meridian Hill Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994, as "an outstanding accomplishment of early 20th-century Neoclassicist park design in the United States" This significant historic resource was originally created to provide visitors and the citizens of Washington D.C. with a formal garden comparable to the public gardens of Paris, Rome and other foreign capital cities. Among its distinctive architectural features are walks, terraces, pools, fountains, and cascades that were constructed of exposed concrete aggregate, using the pioneering techniques developed by craftsman John Earley

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source to Buffalo Computer Graphics Inc. 

Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando intends to award a Sole Source, Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order to Buffalo Computer Graphics Inc. This sole source award is based on FAR Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

 The Government intends to solicit and negotiate directly with BCG Inc. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities must be submitted in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can perform the requirement. A determination to compete this action based on the responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government. All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities in writing via mail, or email. Verifications of receipt of responses are the sole responsibility of the contractor.  All information shall be furnished at No cost or obligation to the Government.  If no responsive statements are received by 05 Feb 2009, an award shall be made to BCG Inc.  The delivery date will be 180 days from time of contract award.


Requirement for Radar Display circuit card modification.

The requirement is to upgrade the currently installed Radar Display Boards (P/N 10-210703) in all seven fielded training systems, modify eight RDP-149 connection cables (P/N: MJ-B24LPF0008), and seven spare Radar Display Boards (P/N 10-210703).  
Buffalo Computer Graphics holds the proprietary rights to the product and does not provide the product design drawings and specifications for sale or use by resellers.  Specific versions of the Buffalo Computer Graphics PCS-100 computers and Radar Display Board products were used by NAWCTSD and other sub-contractors to develop the simulation software and training capability.

The commercial radar used in the Submarine Piloting and Navigation (SPAN) and Reconfigurable Submarine Piloting and Navigation (RSPAN) training systems require an upgrade to support the new commercial radar during the SPAN Phase IV and RSPAN Phase II upgrades scheduled for delivery in April 2009. This required change is mandated by a Technical Engineering Change Request (TECR) issued by the fleet and approved by the NAVSEA sponsor.  The new commercial radar (Furuno GP1920) chosen to be replaced on fleet submarines and requires the training systems to be upgraded is not compatible with existing radar simulator (Buffalo Computer Graphics [BCG] PCS-100) that stimulates both the commercial and military radars used in the trainers.  A modification to the PCS-100s Radar Display circuit card is required by the manufacturer (BCG) to make it compatible with the new commercial radar and maintain compatibility with the military radar.  The modification will remove compatibility of the Radar Display card to drive the existing commercial radar (Furuno Model 1832), which will be removed from all SPAN and RSPAN trainers. The modification to the radar display circuit card will incorporate the capability to stimulate the new commercial radar (FURUNO GP1920) as well as continued support to stimulate the military radar incorporated into the training system still in use.

Work Requirement:

Modify and test 7 Spare Radar Display Circuit cards. To be delivered NLT 15 Days after contract award
Modify and test 7 installed Radar Display Circuit cards. To be delivered NLT 180 Days after contract award.

The NSWCDD reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  NSWCDD reserves the right to fund all, some, or none of the proposals received under this BAA. NSWCDD provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned. It is the policy of NSWCDD to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and not to disclose their contents. This announcement will remain open for 60 days from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during this period.
Please note:  This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY, NOT A SOLICITATION.    Department of Defense funding for this BAA will be provided in one of the following funding categories:  RDT&E (Research Development Test and Evaluation), 6.1. Basic Research, 6.2, Applied Research or 6.3. Advanced Technology Development   
Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division is interested in receiving proposals/ white papers describing sensor concepts to affordably include a specialized seeker inside a guided 81mm mortar called Flight Controlled Mortar (FCMortar).  The baseline FCMortar design uses GPS for guidance, a multi-option fuze, and has space available in the nose tip for CanyonFinder of approximately the size of an existing 81mm mortar fuze, with expansion allowed for apertures or lenses up to 1 inch in diameter.  Technology developers should anticipate similar operating environments to existing 81mm mortar ammunition fired from the M252 mortar system. During, but not limited to, the terminal phase of flight, the Terminal Seeker shall provide inputs to the Guidance, Navigation, & Control (GNC) system to allow the control system to steer the mortar projectile to targets in-between buildings, to the street level.   Proposals should identify system assumptions: initialization procedures, requirements, and timelines; and whether their technology is a Fire & Forget, Energy Designated, Sensor Fusion, or Other.
Questions should be directed to Andre Lowman, Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110,(Code CXS11-8) or email to andre.lowman@navy.mil. 
Terminal Seeker Objectives are:	A. Fire & Forget (F&F) sensor systems require no external designation, after launch, to complete the mission.  F&F proposals should describe how the sensor would complete its mission with in-flight input from onboard systems, and the greater value provided versus other technologies.
B. Energy Designated (ED) sensor systems may utilize external systems to illuminate the target/target area in order to facilitate the determination of the proper target location.  ED Proposals should describe the designator technology, and the greater value provided versus other technologies.
C. Sensor Fusion (SF) sensor systems are combinations of multiple sensor technologies, within the seeker, that work in concert to better meet mission requirements.  Sensor Fusion systems can be F&F, ED, or both.  SF proposals should describe how the combination is of greater value than a single sensor technology alone.
D. Sensor proposals that are categorized as other should describe how their technology doesn't fall into the F&F, ED, or SF categories, and how its uniqueness is of greater value than the other categories.
All sensors, regardless of type, should be small, light-weight, low power, and should describe any impact to the aerodynamics of the system as a whole.  Each proposal should also outline the sensor's environmental limitations.  Application and Submission Process for White Papers	All white papers submissions will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 15.207, applicable law, and Department of Defense and Department of Navy regulations. Offerors are expected to appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information.

WHITE PAPER EVALUATION PLAN DEFINITIONS
STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES/DEFICIENCIES - The consistent identification of proposal strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies is very important in the documentation of the evaluation results.  
 A. A proposal strength is an aspect of the proposal, which meets or exceeds a desired or mandatory requirement of the BAA.  B. A proposal weakness is defined as an unattractive, although not unacceptable, aspect of the proposal.  It is a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of less than successful performance.  A significant weakness is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful performance.  
C. A proposal deficiency is defined as an aspect of the proposal, which is an unacceptable response to the specific factor or sub-factor.  A deficiency indicates unacceptability of an aspect of the proposal, which requires revision before award can be made to that offeror.  The presence of several significant weaknesses in the proposal will be considered as a deficiency.   The presence of several deficiencies in major evaluation factors/sub-factors may warrant exclusion of the proposal from the competitive range.

 RISK ASSESSMENT - A risk assessment will be made for each separately evaluated factor and sub-factor.  This Risk Assessment will include a description of the risk areas made apparent in the offeror's proposal.  It will also include the assessment of the impact those risks will have upon the overall program.  Both risk and the offeror's plans for risk mitigation, if provided, will be evaluated.  A Degree of Risk (high, moderate or low) will be assigned for each evaluated factor/sub-factor as well as the overall proposal in accordance with the following:
HIGH RISK   Likely to cause significant serious disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.  Significant doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record, and/or the information contained in the proposal that the offeror can perform the proposed task.  Detailed justification that explains why the Evaluation Committee took this position must be provided.
MODERATE RISK   Could potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance without close contractor oversight.  Although some doubt exists as to the offeror's ability to perform the task, special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring should be able to overcome difficulties.  There is risk associated with the proposal but the offeror has recognized the risk and has proposed specific actions to mitigate the risk.  The contractor's proposed risk mitigation methods are acceptable to the evaluators.
LOW RISK   Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring should be able to overcome any difficulties.  Little doubt exists that the offeror can perform the proposed task.
G.4 TECHNICAL MATURITY - Offerors will evaluate the technical maturity of the proposed control unit technology on a numerical scale from 1 (very low) to 10 (very high).  Notional benchmarks for assessing technical maturity are as follows:
1 - Basic principles observed and reported.2 - Technology concept and/or application formulated.3- Analytical and experimental critical functions and/or characteristic proof of concept.4 - Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.5 - Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.6 - System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.7 - System prototype demonstration in an operational environment.8 - Actual system completed and 'flight qualified' through test and demonstration.9 - Actual system 'flight proven' through successful mission operations.10 - COTS solution ready for production. 

Questions regarding this announcement may be submitted to NSWCDD (Code CXS11-8), 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110, or email to andre.lowman@navy.mil.  This announcement will remain open and white papers will be accepted through 17 March 2009.  Awards may be made at any time after this notification is published, but only those offerors who have submitted white papers will be considered.  Early submissions are encouraged.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Scientific and Engineering Research for Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, and, as such, solicits the participation of all offerors capable of satisfying the Government's needs.  This BAA should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of a resultant contract; the Government is not bound to make any awards under this announcement.

<RESPDATE>020409
<CONTACT>Christopher D Mettee, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9486, Fax 410-965-9560, Email christopher.mettee@ssa.gov - 
<DESC>This announcement supersedes SSA-RFI-SSNCRP2 in its entirety.  

The Social Security Administration, Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG, in conjunction with its customer, the Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operations (OTSO), is currently performing market research to determine the availability of printers capable of printing Social Security Number (SSN) cards to replace its two IBM 6262 impact printers.  SSA is seeking information from interested sources regarding the availability of printer technologies or printers capable of printing SSN cards utilizing its current card mailer substrate with minimal or no programmatic changes required as workarounds for the printer band-controls.  In addition to information regarding the printer, SSA requests details regarding availability, security, maintainability, stability, and the capacity to accommodate two percent growth annually.  

Synopsis Terms and Conditions: 

 This is a sources sought announcement, a market survey for written information only.  
 This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and the Government will not award a contract from this announcement. 
 The Government will not reimburse for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. 
 The Government will not accept any telephone calls requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation. 
 In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement; the Government will not give information regarding the technical point of contact.
 The Government will not make appointments for presentations.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only, not a commitment by the Government.  
 The Government will use responses to this sources sought/market research notice to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  

As part of a past procurement, SSA tested a printer using Flash Fusion technology that was unsuccessful in maintaining the security of the printed character.  SSA conducted a secure printer replacement study to develop alternative solutions to the current SSN card print environment.  Potential options for replacements identified in the study are UV Cured Inkjet print technologies or technologies that involve physical adhesion of the ink to the SSN Card substrate.  SSA will not consider toner-based solutions.

SSA currently prints an average of 80,000 SSN cards per day.  The size of the SSN card is 4 inches by 8 inches, and SSA prints in the 1-up format on 90-pound paper.  When printing two SSN cards, SSA uses 8 inches by 9 inches.  The 9-inch dimension currently contains tractor feeds that SSA removes during the insertion process.  In the future SSA will change this fan fold to roll stock.  The solution must be field modifiable from fan fold to roll paper stock.

SSA is looking for Vendors that are willing to allow SSA to test their printer solutions for compatibility with SSAs requirements at the Vendors site.  SSA will work with the Vendor to bring substrate materials to the vendors location for adherence testing.  In this case, the Vendor must accept to an evaluation agreement stating the following:

 All risk of loss or damage to the identified product during printing must rest with the provider/manufacturer of the equipment;
 There is no implied contract or implication that evaluation of the identified product would lead to a possible purchase or implementation of the product; 
 There is no obligation for any payment by SSA for any reason, whatsoever;
 The Vendor may not advertise SSA as a user of the identified product;
 SSA is not obligated to share the results of its evaluation; and
 The Vendor must work with SSA to accommodate any necessary security requirements.

If requested, the Vendor may examine the substrate material at SSAs National Computer Center in Baltimore, MD, on a one-time basis.  SSA will not give away samples and the Vendor is responsible for all travel-related costs. 

The printing requirements of SSA are:  

 SSA is not looking for a multiple printer solution.  However, SSA is considering the potential for a backup printer.
 Each printer must be capable of printing up to 120,000 SSN cards per 8 hour shift.  
 The print operator needs to be able to start, stop, and restart print jobs as well as control priorities and print order.   
 The solution must be capable of printing on pin-fed stock and be adaptable to accept roll feed with two-up or three-up stock. 
 The solution must be capable of printing on the current stock (pre-printed, 90 pound banknote stock).  
 Due to a proprietary character set, the printing solution must be capable compatible of receiving an AFP IPDS data stream.  If the printer is not initially compatible, the Vendor may use an IPDS converter. 
 The printed character on the SSN card substrate must be recognizable by OCR readers within the current SSA Track and Trace system.
 The printed character must pass distinctive performance testing in additional to the standard industry tests.  Testing will include at a minimum extensive scratch and lift testing, as-well-as chemical spot testing.
 Printers must cease printing upon error and must indicate the problem by displaying a visible malfunction indicator or message upon the printer.  
 The recommended solution should consider hardware redundancy. 
 Printers must have a visual display showing error messages and/or error codes.
 Power requirement: SSA anticipates implementation of printers in the National Computer Center (NCC) located in Baltimore, MD.  The electrical distribution infrastructure of the NCC is 208V/120V. These are delta/wye configuration transformers. 3-phase power is available and recommended for solutions exceeding 30A.
 The solution must include all hookups necessary to interface with the SSA IPv4 10/100 Ethernet network via an RJ45 connector.
 The solution must be IPv6 compliant or a planned implementation of IPv6 must be established.
 Only new equipment is acceptable.
 Must provide one year of consumables (i.e., Ink, cleaning materials, and any miscellaneous items required by the solution)
 Installation services will be included with the delivery of the printers and shall include unpacking and initial set-up (configuration services).  
 The solution must include an Output Stacker tray.
 The contractor shall provide on-call, on-site maintenance for all hardware supplied for a period of 90 days following the delivery of each printer (warranty period). 
 Optional:  a soundproof cabinet or encasement to reduce noise and comply with OSHA limits.

The workload supported by this secure printing solution is under severe scheduling constrains. If a printer stops for any reason, on site technical support is required within 4 hours, five days a week.  The Contractor must provide repair services when any part of the contractor-provided hardware fails to perform properly.  The printers will be located in Baltimore, Maryland.   

This is not a request for proposal, therefore SSA will not honor or respond to written and/or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation, or other information related to this announcement.  SSA will use this information in their assessment of capable sources. 
 
Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the solution and services required should submit a detailed statement of their solution (including technical specifications of their printer) in writing to Christopher Mettee, Contract Specialist, Division of Information Technology and Maintenance, 7111 Security Boulevard, First Floor Rear Entrance, Baltimore, MD 21244.  SSA will accept responses submitted electronically via email at Christopher.Mettee@ssa.gov.  Please reference SSA-RFI-SSNCRP3 in the email subject line.  SSA must receive all responses by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 4, 2009.

<DESC>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)<BR><BR>1.	PROJECT TITLE:  EUCOM Medical Supply Chain Analysis for Use, Storage and Distribution of Critical and Vital Medical Supplies<BR><BR>2.	BACKGROUND:  As the designated Theater Lead Agent for Medical Materiel (TLAMM), the United States Army Medical Materiel Center Europe (USAMMCE) is tasked to provide overall medical supply chain management support to the European Command (EUCOM) Combatant Commander, through the EUCOM Office of the Surgeon General (SG).<BR><BR>Presently, information regarding medical materiel used or stored throughout EUCOM is unavailable to readiness planners and contingency action officers at the EUCOM/SGs office and USAMMCE.  The information does not exist in a single, accessible data repository and data regarding usage, locations of specific stockpiles, current inventories and due-in or due-out actions on medical materiel is maintained by various organizations and agencies.  This decentralization and localization of information presents a particularly challenging situation for items that are considered critical (life or death) or vital (mitigating impact) by the EUCOM Surgeon General (SG) to address developing situations or determine long-term strategic planning.<BR><BR>This analysis will examine the acquisition, storage and distribution of critical and/or vital medical materiel within the EUCOM Theater.  This analysis will expand the visibility of medical supply customers and locations, and enable the rapid deployment of medical supplies located within the EUCOM AOR at the direction/request of EUCOM/SG.  <BR><BR>3.	SCOPE:  The Contractor shall provide qualified personnel and services necessary to identify the usage, storage and distribution procedures for materiel identified by the EUCOM /SG for pharmaceutical and medical-surgical Class VIII supplies.  The Contractors shall also perform an analysis of the existing supply chain procurement and distribution system and provide recommendations on an execution strategy to obtain and distribute such supplies when necessary.  The list of items shall be limited to approximately 100 high-priority items, located within the EUCOM area of responsibility.  <BR><BR>This analysis is necessary to meet the requirements of the USAMMCE Master Facility Plan Design and Organization Transformation initiatives.   The work products and deliverables of this analysis will impact the future facility design requirements and analyze existing information system resources to provide recommendations for potential system changes to support the role of the TLAMM as a core competency of USAMMCE in its transformation.  Future facility requirements will need to address storage and distribution requirements and address hazardous materiel handling, cold chain management, narcotic security and chain of custody and other requirements.<BR><BR>4. 	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS: The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to those included in Section 6 of the PWS.  The Contractor shall maintain safety and health standards compliant with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<BR><BR>5. 	PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:  The objectives of this project are to identify critical or vital medical supply requirements, locations and organizations that use and/or store these items, identify POCs at each organization to coordinate distribution if required, address issues regarding the acquisition and distribution of the materiel if needed, propose rules of engagement and other guidance to govern the redistribution, and draft appropriate memorandums with the applicable organization.  Specific tasks are outlined in the table below:<BR><BR>Task #	Task Title	Task Description<BR>5.1.	Critical Items List (CI)	Provide a list identifying the items that EUCOM/SG considers life or death: not to exceed 100 items<BR>5.2.	Vital Items List (VI)	Provide a list identifying the items that EUCOM/SG considers vital to mitigate disease and reduce harm: not to exceed 100-[critical item list]<BR>5.3.	Item Usage Information	Obtain annual usage data from USAMMCE/TAMMIS on subject CI and VI materiel<BR>5.4.	User Information	Identify the specific DODAACs/Units that use the materiel throughout EUCOM: not to exceed 750<BR>5.5.

<p>
<p>Duties include but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>In September 2000, the Executive Staff of the Federal Bureau of Prisons approved a concept which would initiate a pilot program of multi-faith Residential Re-entry Program. This voluntary program, Life Connections, will initially be located in five institutions in various regions of the country. The program will be available to men and women inmates.</p>
<p>The program provides inmates with opportunities for spiritual growth and deepening their religious roots by sharing common space and programs for the purpose of personal transformation and reducing recidivism. Inmates participate in religion specific and multi-faith program components designed to bring restoration with God, family, community, and self. The program's design increases religious tolerance and respect among inmates of various faiths; connects each inmate with a spiritual mentor; and links participants with a faith community at their release destination in order to enhance community reintegration. Another component of the program initiates specific Victim Impact programs to assist inmates in claiming responsibility for their actions and making amends with victims, family, and community.</p>
<p>The program enlists partnerships with individuals and organizations in its efforts to lower recidivism and facilitate spiritual growth and personal change. Volunteers, contractors, mentors, sponsoring religious congregations and organizations are all essential partners in the program.</p>
<p>The goal of the Bureau of Prisons Residential Life Connections Program is to provide inmates living in a shared living space with intensive opportunities for holistic life restoration for the purpose of reducing recidivism and enhancing prison management.</p>
<p align="justify">B. SUBJECT:</p>
<p align="justify">Acquisition of a Community Liaison who will assist in the recruitment and training of a broad spectrum of religious congregations and civic organizations to serve both as incarceration phase mentors and others as post-incarceration phase mentors for inmate participants in the Life Connections Program. The relationship between the incarceration phase mentors and the inmate participants will begin within three months of the inmate beginning the program and will continue at least until their graduation. The contractor will promote the Bureau of Prisons Residential Life Connections Program in the community at large in an effort to recruit and maintain relationships with re-entry mentors. This is a multi-faith program, so the contractor will be expected to foster relationships with a broad variety of religious communities on a nationwide scale.</p>
<p align="justify">The contractor will provide training for both sets of mentors prior to and during the time they are mentoring. They will also provide bimonthly follow-up reports on status of the post-incarceration mentoring for the first year after each graduate is released.</p>
<p align="justify">The contractor will develop and provide access to the Bureau of Prisons, a web-based data collection system to assist in tracking the progress of program participants after their release to the community. The contractor will work with the sponsoring congregations to gather data used in compiling information related to the baseline measures of the program.</p>
<p align="justify">C. PLACEMENT OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p align="justify">The scope of this position requires contacts with religious congregations and civic organizations nationwide. The contractor may operate from their home office location for approximately 10 hours each week and will be required to work at the pilot site here at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), Milan, MI approximately 20 hours each week</p>
<p align="justify">D. SCHEDULE:</p>
<p align="justify">The contractor will commit 30 hours each week to the recruitment, training, coordination, and retention of incarceration phase mentors and post-incarceration phase mentors for the multi-faith Residential Life Connections Program. The schedule may include some weekend and/or evening hours based on program needs.</p>
<p align="justify">E. SUPPLIES:</p>
<p align="justify">All supplies that the contractor may routinely need will be supplied by the contractor. Travel costs and routine office expenses are the responsibility of the contractor. These supplies will normally include any materials needed to perform the services covered under this contract. If known, the name of the congregation, of which the inmate is associated with at their release destination will be supplied to the contractor.</p>

<p align="justify">Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements</p>
<p align="justify">Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) (See Note I) entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I. (1) Long-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p align="justify">In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term (See Note ii) contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:(a) Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;</p>
<p align="justify">&copy; Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:</p>
<p align="justify">-- High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)</p>
<p align="justify">-- Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)</p>
<p align="justify">-- Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation</p>
<p align="justify">(d) The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:</p>
<p align="justify">(1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Favorable fingerprint results;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Favorable credit report, if required; (See Note iii)</p>
<p align="justify">(4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and</p>
<p align="justify">(5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) (See Note iv) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). (e) Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the FBI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Short-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p align="justify">It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a.and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:</p>
<p align="justify">(a) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Favorable fingerprint results;</p>
<p align="justify">&copy; Favorable credit report, if required; (See Note v) and</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.</p>
<p align="justify">A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Intermittent Contractors:</p>
<p align="justify">An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.</p>
<p align="justify">(a) For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.</p>
<p align="justify">&copy; Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p align="justify">(4) An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.</p>
<p align="justify">(5) The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.</p>

<p align="justify">ii) Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.</p>
<p align="justify">iii) For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.</p>
<p align="justify">iv) In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM's instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code "3" must be placed in block "B" of the "Agency Use Only" section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation Number is NAMA-09-Q-0028 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The NAICS code for this requirement is 722310.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition circular 2005-30 effective date January 15, 2009.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed-price contract.  Prices must be composite prices for providing the services specified herein and must include the cost for all supervision, direct labor, equipment, materials, overhead, other direct costs, subcontracts, general and administrative expenses (G&A) and profit.  The initial order will be placed following receipt and evaluation of quotations.  For evaluation purposes, the firm fixed-price of the contract will be determined by multiplying the Unit Prices entered by the Quantity of the pertinent CLIN and adding the CLINs for each performance period.  The period of performance is as follows:  Base Period  March  1, 2009 to February 28, 2010 for CLINs 0001-0004; Option Period 1 - March 1, 2010 to February 28, 2011 for CLINs 0005-0008; Option Period 2 - March 1, 2011 to February 28, 2012 for CLINs 0009-0012; Option Period 3  March 1, 2012 to February 28, 2013 for CLINs 0013-0016; and Option Period 4  March  1, 2013 to February 28, 2014 for CLINs 0017-0020.

The anticipated award date of the resulting contract is February 23, 2009.

In order to evaluate the relevant past performance, the contractor must provide contact information for no more than five references.  All qualified responsible business sources may submit a quotation, which will be considered by NARA.  A site visit has been schedule for February 3, 2009 at 10:00 AM.

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) price; (iii) past performance in relative order of importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are <span style="color: #ff0000;">comparable to price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>20 Jan 09</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction/Background: 1 ASTS is expanding and upgrading the Consolidated Launch Control Room (CLCC), B8510 room 180D Vandenberg AFB CA. To make room for Ground Support Equipment (GSE) that launch teams will be using to control launch vehicles, space will need to be freed up.</p>
<p>2.0 Objectives: The objective of this task is two-fold:</p>
<p>2.1 Remove Process Air Conditioners (PAC) units 12 and 13 from B8510 room 180D while maintaining functionality of PAC unit 9 in room 180C.</p>
<p>2.1.1 Remove PAC unit's #12 and #13 and source power wiring between Room 190 and 180D. Breakers in room 190 to be labeled "Spare". Conduit to be cut just above ceiling in room 180D. All associated wiring, conduit, and disconnect switches below ceiling and floor in Room 180D are to be removed, being careful not to remove or disturb other under floor circuits or COMM lines.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Contractor will need to isolate chilled water loop, drain and capture. Once PAC #13 is remove loop will be severed. Reconnect loop above false ceiling in room 180D to keep active for PAC #9 in room 180C. Cut and cap chilled water supply and return lines within one foot of main loop supply and return lines above room 197. Contractor will need to return drained glycol back to the chilled water loop and dispose of the rest per environmental requirements.</p>
<p>2.1.3 Transport PAC units #12 and #13 to DRMO. (DMRO-Bldg. 7420, 805-606-9852)</p>
<p>2.1.4 Repair floor under where PPU's and PAC's were installed. This should also include floor tiles where chilled water lines and power conduits created holes as a result of this project. Floor is believed to be in sound condition with jacks and floor trusses in place. Contractor will need to verify. Some floor jacks, truss supports, and gaskets are on site can be used if necessary. There are adequate numbers of floor tiles on site, but approximately four each will need to be cut to size. (Contact Facility Manager Randal Hunt, 805-605-2794 for floor tiles)</p>
<p>2.1.5 Reference Attachment 2 &amp; 3 for further detail.</p>
<p>2.2 Remove Two Power Distribution Units (PDU) and the associated wiring.</p>
<p>2.2.1 Remove (2) PDUs 100-3 and 200-3 in room 180D and the source wiring back to UPS in Room 190. Leave pull string in each conduit for future use. Cut conduit just above ceiling line in Room 180D. (2) Two breakers in Room 190 to be labeled "Spare".</p>
<p>2.2.2 Reference Attachment 1, drawing 800VR160009 for further detail.</p>
<p>2.2.3 Remove all Room 180D PDU output power conduits and wiring "under the floor" including two each emergency shut off switches and related conduit, being careful not to remove or disturb other under floor circuits or COMM lines. Due to no accurate drawings of these circuits contractors will have to estimate the number of circuits base of panel schedule details, which there are a combined total of 24 each 10 amp circuits. All circuits in question within Room 180D.</p>
<p>2.2.4 Once the PDU's in Room 180D have been removed they can be delivered to DRMO on base.</p>
<p>3.0 Requirements: The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, equipment, tools, materials, and work effort to remove the two PAC units (12 &amp; 13) from B8510 room 180D and the two PDUs.</p>
<p>3.1 This effort requires a through walk down, by appointment with the facility manager, to identify all power sources and glycol lines to be disconnected/removed or reconfigured. <br />3.2 All work that will impact facility power and water will be coordinated and scheduled with the facility manager.<br />3.3 This effort includes removing excess glycol lines attached to the units in such a way as to ensure the continued use of PAC unit 9 in room 180C (next to 180D). <br />3.4 Excess glycol and glycol contaminated materials will be removed and disposed of in a manner consistent with state and local environmental regulations.<br />3.5 Upon completion of all plumbing work a leakage test must be completed and reported to the facility manager.<br />3.6 All wiring will be removed and disposed of at DRMO.<br />3.7 All wire ways will be removed so that they terminate above the drop ceiling in 180D and to a safe height in the facility electrical rooms.<br />3.8 A pull rope will be left in place in each abandoned conduit for possible future installs.<br />3.9 All disconnected circuits will have their circuit breakers tagged as spares.<br />3.10 All electrical work shall comply with NEC standards.<br />3.11 All work shall be accomplished in accordance with all contract specifications, common work practices, and industry and OSHA standards.<br />3.12 Facility drawings will be "redlined" to show changes to the PDU and PAC systems (glycol/power).<br />3.13 Facility escorts will be provided by the 1 ASTS.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-668, email: Michael.Jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreement, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/ACQ, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause), 5352-242-9000, Access To Air Force Installations. Also your quote must list your DUNS number, CAGE code, and Federal TIN with Company name, POC and phone number. If you need to obtain or renew a DUNS number or CAGE code, please visit www.ccr.gov. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.</p>

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
FOR
DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY (DLA)
EMERGENT R&D REQUIREMENTS 
JUNE 4, 2008
________________________________________
POINT OF CONTACT: 	Mr.  John Dormer, Contracting Officer

1.  BACKGROUND

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Research & Development (R&D) Branch is charged with conducting research and development in all areas relevant to the DLA mission and across all DLA supply chains. DLA defines its current R&D requirements each year and seeks funding for them through the Department of Defenses Program Planning, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process. These planned-for requirements produce a robust logistics R&D program addressing areas such as energy readiness, combat rations, uniform manufacturing, shelters, casting and forging, weapon system sustainment, medical logistics and electronics availability. Despite these ongoing efforts, other R&D requirements arise each year that could not have been anticipated and were not budgeted.

DLAs need for this Emergent (R&D) Requirements BAA stems from the appearance of these unplanned-for R&D requirements that are not addressed by the PPBE process.  Most of these requirements are in the form of additional research areas (beyond those funded by DLAs Presidents Budget request) added by Congress to the DLA R&D appropriation each year. Other emergent requirements come from DLA operations as new challenges to meet some kind of unplanned Agency need in the course of the year. These requirements can address virtually any logistics-related R&D topic and each year generally presents a mixture of new projects and new funding on prior years congressionally directed efforts.
	
2. GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION

This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of one year from the date of publication.   No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same shall be disregarded. Interested entities may submit a white paper for any logistics R&D requirements. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. Any responsible source capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a white paper which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit white papers and join others in submitting white papers; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.  Large Business concerns will be required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard for Small Business is fewer than 500 employees.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a white paper to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred.  White papers may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be disregarded.  

3. AREAS OF INTEREST

DLA is interested in receiving white papers ONLY for R&D for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in defense logistics. The particular emergent requirements that are the subject of this BAA are: 

(1) to operate a network of lean manufacturing experts who will combine high-level strategic consulting and hands-on assistance to help small to midsized manufacturers who are lower-tier suppliers to DoD primes improve their operations and improve performance by making those suppliers faster, more flexible, leaner and more efficient; 

(2) to provide training and one-on-one assistance to small manufacturing firms to upgrade their capabilities to supply obsolete parts to DoD by enhancing their reverse engineering capabilities, including developing acceptable technical data packages; 

(3) to explore the use of various biofuels feedstocks in jet fuels and examine the impact of introducing biofuels into the current jet fuel delivery stream; 

(4) to develop small manufacturers as DoD suppliers for DLAs Battlefield Back-Order Breakout Initiative (B3I) program , which seeks to provide parts urgently needed in-theater from new suppliers; and

(5) to address parts backorder reduction by conducting requirements analyses and technical risk assessments and developing prototype tools to improve management of warfighter materiel. 

White papers may be based on fundamental research and development; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements and processes; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; development of associated industrial capabilities support techniques and processes; development of associated manufacturing techniques and processes; modeling and simulation; simulation-based acquisition; integrated data environments and product data managers; and development of operational systems. 

5. EVALUATION CRITERIA 

White papers will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs (subject to the availability of funds).  These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price. Any responsible businesses may submit a white paper. White papers may be submitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  Please refer to BAA number BAA 0004-08 in all correspondence and communications.  While it is the intent to award a Cost type contract, the Government reserves the right to award a Fixed Price contract when it is in the best interest of the Government. The BAA will remain open for approximately 1 year for submission of white papers. 

6. WHITE PAPER FORMAT

The following guidelines apply to concept papers or white papers. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are advised to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 5 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically.  A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work must accompany the white paper. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail.  White papers for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding.

The following evaluation factors must be addressed in the white paper:  (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives.

(1)  OVERALL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT: Offerors will propose a project that includes: (a) The improved logistics capability to be established, expressed in terms of outcomes that are important to the Logistics Support process; (b) Clear description of problem being addressed and tasks to be performed and deliverables to be provided; (c) Realism of (a) and (b) above.

(2) POTENTIAL RELEVANCE AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE AREA OF INTEREST.  Offerors shall propose projects that address (a) the applications of the technology; (b) how the technology will address long and short term needs of the Department of Defense and (c) the expected benefits.

(3) DEGREE TO WHICH NEW AND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO TECHNICAL ISSUES IMPORTANT TO THE AREA OF INTEREST ARE PROPOSED AS WELL AS THE DEGREE TO WHICH TECHNICAL DATA OR COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED UNDER THE PROPOSED EFFORT ARE TO BE DELIVERED WITH UNRESTRICTED RIGHTS.

(4) THE OFFEROR'S CAPABILITIES, RELATED EXPERIENCE, FACILITIES, TECHNIQUES OR UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF THESE WHICH ARE INTEGRAL FACTORS FOR ACHIEVING THE PROPOSAL OBJECTIVES.  Offerors shall provide information pertaining to prior significant and related work experience or expertise in any of the listed areas of interest, and how that expertise shall be beneficial to this program. Offerors shall provide the two largest accounts/contracts/projects within the last three years for which they have provided services and/or supplies of a nature consistent with this program. Offerors shall include at least two (2) points of contact and a telephone number for each account/contract, a description of the service or supply which was provided, as well as a brief performance history on each of those accounts/contracts. Where related work was performed with teaming partners, provide points of contact of teaming members to include company name, individuals and phone numbers. 

(5) THE QUALIFICATIONS, CAPABILITIES AND EXPERIENCE OF THE PROPOSED PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR, TEAM LEADER OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL WHO ARE CRITICAL IN ACHIEVING THE PROPOSAL OBJECTIVES.

(6) COST REALISM: The cost realism will include a rough estimate of all of the cost information related to the Project Task, including direct labor and indirect costs.

The purpose of this amendment 1 is to:
(1) Extend the deadline for receipt of proposals which was Wednesday, January 28 at noon EST to Tuesday, February 3 at noon EST; and
(2) Provide the following questions and answers.

Q: Does the current line fit into a bead lock around the top of the pool as I suspect? (Beaded Liner)
A: Yes, as Secret Service understands it.

Q: For the drain covers. Do they and all intake lines leading back to the pump and filter system currently exist? If so what are the dimensions?
A: 1 foot x 2 foot

Q: Do you have a print of the line that was manufactured for this pool from the last replacement?  
A: No.

Q: The felt on the face of the aluminum sides, what size pieces are these and how are they attached to the wall currently?
A: Unknown.

Q: How were the aluminum side walls installed and what is currently supporting them?
A: There is a support structure around the entire pool including the crawl space.

Q: Who is responsible for filling the pool after the liner is installed. (This must be done at the same time of the installation at a rapid rate because the liner is vacuum fit to mold exactly to the pool surface.)
A: Secret Service in coordination with a contractor will fill the pool.

Q: Are there any recessed steps?
A: Yes.

Q: How many lights are in the pool?
A: 15.

Q: How much area around the pool do we have to work?
A: 10 feet on the sides, 15 feet on the ends.

Q: Is there plenty of power supply surrounding the pool area for electrical equipment?
A: The contractor will need to supply their own power source.

Q: What is the proposed start date for this project?
A: Immediately after award. Award is anticipated as no later than February 6.

Q: Do you have pictures of the pool in its current condition from the outside, a picture of the bead holding the liner, pictures of the back side of the aluminum from the crawl space?
A: A site visit has been offered. Secret Service will not publicly release pictures.

Q: What happens if there are excess cost because of issues not able to be identified until the old material has been removed or the preliminary inspection has been completed?
A: The contract will contain language such as:
After award of this firm fixed price contract, the contractor shall submit recommendations for any proposed changes that may fall outside of the original scope of the Statement of Work. The contractor shall submit these recommendations with their new proposal in contractor format to the Government which define the contractors need for change, scope of change, schedule impact, and associated costs to replace the pool liner due to technical obsolescence, etc. The contractor may implement changes to the SOW in future, bilateral modifications, which do not negatively affect the pools form, fit, function, or cause degradation to the system as defined by this SOW.

Q: Will we finalize the quote after the inspection prior to work beginning?
A: Your quote should fulfill the existing Statement of Work. If there is unanticipated additional work, or an unanticipated savings to the Government, the Contractor and the Government will re-negotiate the firm fixed price awarded

<DESC>Questions and Answers for aforementioned RFQ

Q. Since the submittal is requested in electronic format, are two copies each of the business proposal and the technical proposal needed? 

A. Only one copy of each is submitted electronically.

Q. Is there a preferred or required document format for the submittal?

A. No

Q. The period of performance for the contract is listed an 39 months, but the major deliverables (seminars) are required to be completed within 24 months of the project inception. Is it acceptable to propose a shorter period of performance (e.g. 27 or 30 months?

A. The period of performance for this requirement is 39 months.

Q. Are there specific guidelines for cost items required related to what needs to be provided at each workshop such as meals, number of meeting rooms etc.?

A. The contractor will determine best way to cover costs. We assume no cost to the Chinese for attendance.

Q. Two potential locations of the seminars were ntntioned in the RFP. How definite these locations are? What is the possibility that MEP will require a different location for each of the seminar?

A. The fiinal location of the seminars will be decided by the contractor in cooperation with USTDA and the Steering Committee. Offerors should submit their proposal for the best designed seminars in terms of length, size, format, location, etc.

Q. Would the physical presence in China requuirement be satisfied by partinering with a local firm in China?

A. USTDA prefers that offerors have a local presence in China, through the prime or through a subcontractor, that has the technnical and logistical skills to organize the workshops. This is in the interest of reducing the need for extensive, costly travel to China by the U.S. Contractor.

Q. Are Chinese participants tp be chaged a registration fee and if so, what amount?

A. Travel costs (hotel, perdiem, etc) for Chinese participants are not expected to be covered by the contractor, not will Chinese participants be expected to pay a registration fee.

Q. Are U.S. private sector participants to be charged a registration fee and if so, what amount?

A. U.S. companies are envisioned largely as potential presentors and contributors. Should it be determined that there is an interest in having U.S. companies participate, they may be charge an amount to cover their costs and a small fee to cover overhead.

<DESC><p>Offeror's questions and Government's response to the questions:</p>
<p>11. Does the Government require a stand-alone/private monitoring system, or is the Government only interested in purchasing tracking services from a GPS service provider?&nbsp; The latter being a service that is available via the Internet that provides a certain level of security.&nbsp; THE GOVERNMENT IS INTERESTED IN TRACKING THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF SCHOOL BUSES.&nbsp; ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM MUST BE CONTROLLED USING AUTHENTICATED LOGON (USER ID AND PASSWORD).&nbsp; THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO USE A PRIVATE NETWORK TO TRANSMIT THE LOCATION DATA.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Is it anticipated that a formal RFP will be posted after the pre-solicitation conference?&nbsp; YES, THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP)/SOLICITATION AFTER THE PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE.&nbsp; RATHER THAN INCORPORATING A PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) IN THE RFP, THE SOLICITATION WILL&nbsp;INCLUDE A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO)&nbsp;SO OFFERORS CAN PROPOSE INNOVATIVE/COST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES.&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. The requirements state, "The system should be commercially-based."&nbsp; Does this mean that the system should be currently available on the commercial market, or that the system is able to integrate with commercial products (i.e., transponders or other tracking devices)?&nbsp; THE SYSTEM SHOULD MAXIMIZE USE OF EXISTING COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES, AS OPPOSED TO TECHNOLOGIES DESIGNED AND BUILT FOR THIS SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT.</p>

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT
In accordance with Section 3.2.1.2.1 of the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS), the Academic Community and Aviation Industry are hereby informed that the FAA has future requirements in systems engineering with a focus on developing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  It is anticipated that these requirements will be fulfilled under a cooperative agreement entitled: The NextGen Systems Engineering & Environmental (NSEE) Program.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be interpreted as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  Since this is a market survey seeking interested sources, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.
The purpose of this announcement is to determine interest in the university community and its potential partners (private and/or other public institutions). Each institution and organization should have the established technical research capabilities and academic curriculum necessary to participate as a potential team member, affiliate, or industry partner with FAA under the proposed NextGen Systems Engineering & Environmental (NSEE) Program.  
This market survey also seeks to identify subcontracting opportunities and direct contract/agreement opportunities for universities (particularly Minority Serving Institutions, such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Native American Serving Institutions (NASIs) among others).
It is the intent of the FAA to enter into cooperative agreements with the successful team(s).  In addition, under a cooperative agreement the FAA will also provide for IPA (Intergovernmental Personnel Arrangements) assignments and OTAs (Other Transaction Arrangements) as deemed necessary.  IPAs allow for continued knowledge, personnel exchange, and augmentation of internal resources through the exchange of personnel.  An OTA is an agreement between the FAA and a non-Federal entity (either foreign or domestic) where the FAA's purpose is to obtain a direct benefit that advances the agency's mission while also providing assistance to the general public.  
Results from this market survey will assist the FAA in determining the method and type of procurement competition - full and open; limited; or sole source.  
The cooperative agreement(s) is/are anticipated to last ten (10) years in duration. The agreement(s) will provide the terms and conditions for the potential contracts, grants, Intergovernmental Personnel Assignments (IPAs), other transaction arrangements (OTAs).  The total combined award(s) are not expected to exceed $140 million.

<CONTACT>Umetria Thomas, 919-549-4385

<a href="mailto:umetria.thomas@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Research Triangle Park</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, is issuing the FINAL Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-08-R-0013, for the Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance (NS CTA).  The purpose of the United States Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance (NS CTA) Program Announcement (PA) is to solicit offers to establish a new Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA) in the area of Network Science (NS), hereinafter called the NS CTA.  This CTA consists of two components: (1) the fundamental research component and (2) the technology transition component. The fundamental research component will provide for basic and applied research, the results of which will be in the public domain.  The fundamental research program is sought in network science integration research and three specific research areas.  The three research areas are focused on Information Networks, Social/Cognitive Networks and Communications Networks.  Each of these basic research areas is to be led by an academic institution and is referred to in this CTA as an Academic Research Center (ARC).  The fourth research area, Integration Research, referred to in this CTA as the Integration Research Center (IRC), is focused on achieving integrated information-social/cognitive-communications networks by promoting and performing cross-cutting foundational network science basic research, implementing theory, computation, and experimentation that characterize and provide insights into the interplay and composability of these interacting complex networks, and advancing the basic research breakthroughs through an applied research program. The performance of collaborative research (involving government, industrial, and academic concerns) is expected to result in dramatic results and new solutions in network science.  In addition to performing and leading basic research on network science integration issues, the IRC will perform applied research and execute the management and transition responsibilities of the CTA.  Consequently, the IRC must perform several roles: the critical role of leading and performing/executing fundamental network science integration basic research; of stimulating and leading research across specific multidisciplinary areas; and of performing applied research that advances and demonstrates the discoveries in the basic research program; as well as carrying-out the management, administration, and transition roles and functions.  The Network Science CTA will include a world-class network science virtual research center.  To that end, the IRC must provide a distributed multi-user experimentation environment that can be accessed by all members from their home locations, as well as a NS CTA Facility for integration research, essential collaborations, and test-bed operation.  It is expected, but not required, that the NS CTA Facility be located at one of the IRC member locations.  As the central facility for the integration experimentation environment, the NS CTA Facility must provide sufficient space for all personnel supporting the IRC, including the visiting scientists from the ARCs and the government.  The technology transition component will provide for the application of the fundamental research results to military and other Government applications.  The NS CTA PA has been posted at www.grants.gov and the NS CTA website: http://www.arl.army.mil/networkscience. This PA will result in the award of two instruments:  (1) a cooperative agreement as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the Fundamental Research Component; and (2) a procurement contract as defined in 31 U.S.C. 6303 for the execution of the Technology Transition Component.  The cooperative agreement for the Fundamental Research Component will be awarded to a Consortium consisting of four Principal Members.  Three of the Principal Members will come from the three ARCs (one from each Center) described above with the fourth coming from the IRC.  Each Principal Member may also include General Members as necessary and appropriate to fulfill the goals of the NS CTA Program. The Principal Members associated with the ARCs for Information Networks, Social/Cognitive Networks, and Communications Networks must be academic concerns.  Further, each of the three ARCs and the IRC are required to include an HBCU/MI as the Principal or as a General Member. The Principal Member for IRC may be an academic, non-profit, or industrial concern, and will be the Lead of the Consortium.  The procurement contract will be awarded to the Principal Member or General Member specified as such in the IRC proposal that is selected for award.  Individual tasks will be issued under the procurement contract as transition opportunities are identified from the research results under the cooperative agreement.   Under this PA, proposals are sought to select the four Principal Members for the NS CTA.  Proposals must address only one of the three ARCs or the IRC.  The proposed Principal Member for each ARC and the IRC is responsible for submitting the proposal on behalf of any General Members included in their proposal.  Should an offeror desire to propose under more than one of the Centers, a complete separate proposal must be submitted for each area.  There will be one cooperative agreement award that will be made to a Consortium consisting of the four Principal Members selected for award and any General Members included in their proposals.  There will be one contract award to the Principal Member or General Member specified in the IRC proposal that is selected for award.  Planned funding levels for the NS CTA are set forth in the PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the Network Science consortium for five years with an option for an additional five years.

<DESC><p>The following questions and answers are provided for clarification purposes
to assist in the preparation of offerors' capability statements:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>QUESTION #1.</strong> Would you please provide
clarification on the nature of the work for DIA Opportunity - Cyber Space Support
Services Sources Sought?&nbsp; Will it involve budget/POM development,
requirements development, and other activities that will give us an unfair
competitive advantage and prevent us from bidding on programs because of a
conflict of interest?&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoList"><strong><span style="color: blue;">ANSWER #1. </span></strong><span style="color: blue;">This effort is for development of
an extensive program outlining and implementing the DIOCC role in cyberspace.
It will not include budget/POM development. The role will support combatant
commands and defense policy-makers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color: blue;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>QUESTION #2.</strong>&nbsp; If the
nature of the work involves these activities, may I suggest releasing a
clarification to the Sources Sought that states one or more of these activities
will be required?&nbsp; Also, will it be possible to bid on the portions that
don&rsquo;t require these activities?&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color: blue;">ANSWER #2. </span></strong><span style="color: blue;">Bids must be provided for all tasks in the SOW, not
partial.</span><span style="color: blue;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>QUESTION #3</strong>. While I know this hasn't
been solicited yet, I'm writing to inquire whether this is a new requirement OR
if there is a current contract in place with an incumbent.&nbsp; If the latter,
can you provide the incumbent?</p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color: blue;">ANSWER #3. </span></strong><span style="color: blue;">This is a new requirement; there is no incumbent.</span><span style="color: blue;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>QUESTION #4</strong>. Are these support
services performed at the DIAC Bolling AFB, Washington
 DC,
DIOCC office ? If no, then where are these services performed?&nbsp; (on site
with the customer, at another location other than the DIOCC office, or at the
contractor's location).</p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color: blue;">ANSWER #4. </span></strong><span style="color: blue;">Services will be performed at the DIAC Bolling AFB
supporting</span><span style="color: blue;"> <span>the DIOCC and may include travel to other DIA locations.</span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>QUESTION #5.</strong>&nbsp; Are you or
someone else in your office available for a phone conversation to find out more
specifically the types of support services that are needed to successfully
perform this contract?&nbsp; Is there a black out period for this procurement?</p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color: blue;">ANSWER #5. </span></strong><span style="color: blue;">Support services will be specified in the SOW, but
the areas of support include, collections, assessments, plans and operations.</span><span style="color: blue;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>QUESTION #6.</strong>&nbsp; What are the
clearance requirements for the personnel supporting this contract and/or
contractor facility requirements for this endeavor?</p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color: blue;">ANSWER #6. </span></strong><span style="color: blue;">Personnel must have a TS/SCI clearance and must have
a TS facility clearance.</span><span style="color: blue;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>QUESTION #7.</strong> I am looking for any
further guidance you might provide as far as the content of the response to the
above referenced solicitation.&nbsp; Is that a maximum page limit?&nbsp; A
preferred submission format?&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color: blue;">ANSWER #7. </span></strong><span style="color: blue;">There is no specific page limit or preferred
submission format.&nbsp; A two page summary of your company's capabilities and
experience will suffice.</span><span style="color: blue;"></span></p>
