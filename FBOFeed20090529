<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory intends to conduct negotiations on a sole source basis with Vanderbilt University Medical Systems. The proposed contract action is for the Development of a Demonstration and Sentinel Surveillance System for PPE usage in healthcare workers at the University. The proposed contract is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B). The Vanderbilt University is considered to be the only source. The government has conducted extensive best practice and literature research which revealed that no other institutions met the criteria required for the operation of this project. The criteria indicated that the contractor must be a large University Medical System that has conducted the major components of the statement of work for at least five years. It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered through competition, and/or unacceptable delays. No other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Competitive solicitation documents are not available. This notice is for informational purposes only. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>1. Background.

There are four T-AOE 6 Class Fast Combat Support Ships built for the U.S. Navy by National Steel and Shipbuilding Corporation and put into service between 1994 and 1998.  The four ships are the SUPPLY (6), RAINIER (7), ARCTIC (8) and the BRIDGE (10).  These ships are powered by four General Electric (GE) LM 2500 gas turbines rated at 26,250 HP each. Each pair of engines drives a twin input, double reduction, locked train type main reduction gear (MRG) that drives a fixed pitch propeller at a maximum of 140 RPM.  Each MRG has two Franco Tosi reversible hydraulic converter couplings (RCC) that are used for low speed maneuvering and reversing the propeller shaft, in a maneuvering mode. Synchro-Self Shifting (SSS) clutches are engaged to transfer to a direct drive mode, which provides higher efficiency and allows full power operation.

The primary mission of the T-AOE 6 Class is to conduct underway replenishment (UNREP).  The ship is specifically designed for receiving fuel, ammunition, provisions, and stores at sea from shuttle ships and redistributing these items to the Carrier Battle Group ships using both ship-to-ship connected replenishment (CONREP), and vertical replenishment (VERTREP) using embarked helicopters.  

Military Sealift Command (MSC) plans to replace the Machinery Control System (MCS) in all four T-AOE 6 Class ships during major shipyard availabilities scheduled for FY 2011 through 2015.  MSC expects to separately award a contract for supply of the replacement Machinery Control Sytem hardware and related installation efforts.  

This contract will cover specialized engineering services to assist MSC’s project design team.  The work will start with source selection support on the MCS replacement specification, and if all options are exercised, may extend through the design, production, installation, commissioning and initial period back in service of all four T-AOE’s after they receive the new MCS.  Typical work under this contract could include development of design requirements, review of design products from the MCS supplier, testing and installation oversight, and involvement in optimization and problem resolution after the new MCS’ are put into service.  

This contract is follow on tasking for the development of the technical specification for the T-AOE 6 MCS.  The support provided by the contractor has been vital to the success of the project to date and is needed for the remaining phases of this work to ensure the system is integrated with the ship properly.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Presagis USA, Inc. of 1301 W George Bush Fwy Ste 120, Richardson TX 75080, to procure the following:
Qty.3, Creator Maintenance, 1 year, Previously part of Creator Terrain Bundle, P/N: 403-02-005-001-340-01Qty.3, Creator Terrain Studio (CTS) Maintenance, 1 year, Previously part of Creator Terrain Bundle forCTS, P/N: 403-02-007-002-220-01Qty.3, Vega Prime - PC Maintenance, 1 year, P/N: 403-03-009-003-220-01
This procurement is sole source for the following reasons:  The full software packages were purchased as part of a facility upgrade several years ago and have been consistently used.  These software packages are mature products representing many man-years of effort.  Creator Maintenance, Creator Terrain Studio, and Vega Prime are only available from Presagis.  This vendor was identified as the sole provider when the software was originally purchased, and remains the only vendor for maintenance/support of the software.  The software packages, used over many years, are extensively linked to several model and simulation packages, and represent years of investment.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This pre-qualification notice provides potential suppliers notification and opportunity related to the US Postal Service’s intent to solicit proposals to provide telecommunication services to support the USPS nationwide.  

The Postal Service is seeking suppliers that have demonstrated their ability to perform consistently to high standards of quality and reliability in delivering products and services.  This pre-qualification process requires interested suppliers to submit a written pre-qualification package in accordance with the instructions outlined in this notice.

The USPS is considering a multiple award scenario for this procurement.  The successful supplier(s), as a result of this competitive process, will be required to fully integrate into the USPS telecom billing, ordering, inventory, and remedy systems. 

Note that the USPS considers the ownership of an established telecom network infrastructure to be advantageous not only from cost efficiency perspective but also from management and control capability.  Therefore, suppliers that provide integration telecom services and do not own/operate an established telecom network infrastructure will be at a scoring disadvantage for the "data transport" evaluated category.

In order to be considered for this pre-qualification opportunity, interested suppliers must respond to this notice as outlined in the attached documents by the posted due date.

<DESC>This solicitation is a 100% Small Business Set Aside, five-year IDIQ for the Nosecup Disk Valve, NSN: 4820-01-260-8703, P/N: 5-1-1081 and the Outlet Valve Disk (OVD), NSN: 4820-01-502-7372, P/N: 5-1-3525.  The anticipated maximum estimated quantity for both items combined over the five-year period is 800,000.  The guaranteed minimum quantity is 4,000 boxes of Nosecup Disk Valves and 4,000 boxes of Outlet Disk Valves.  This is best value procurement, and past performance will be evaluated along with price and technical.  FOB is Destination.  A First Article Test (FAT) is required 90 days after contract award, with deliveries commencing 60 days after FAT approval.  The government may consider waiving FAT for those contractors that have previously produced this item.  The Nosecup Disk Valve is made from silicone rubber, optional in color and is approximately .920 inches in diameter x .56 inches long and is T shaped.   The Outlet Disk Valve is molded from an olive drab silicone rubber and has an approximate diameter of 1.20 inches in diameter x 1.182 inches long and is T shaped.  The material thickness of the outlet valve disk is approximately .022 inches.  Extending out from the center of the disk is a stem measuring slightly over one inch in length.  Near the base of the stem is a knob that helps secure the outlet valve disk to the outlet valve body of the mask. The outlet valve disk allows a mask users exhaled air to be discharged from the mask and prevents outside air from entering the mask through the same opening.  Since the outlet valve disk is used on a sealing surface of the mask, it is crucial that the disk be free of defects such as wraps, bumps, nicks, excess material, etc.  To assure proper performance the outlet valve disk is required to pass leakage testing as well as meet a maximum airflow resistance when air is exhaled.  FOB is Destination.  Estimated issue date is July 6, 20009.

<DESC>RECOVERY--The purpose of this project is to install pre-cast concrete panels on the water side of the existing perched canal wall to prevent seepage and to protect the historic man-made canal wall from a catastrophic section breach.  The pre-cast panels will be secured under water at the base by either keying them into bedrock or by drilled piers.  The void created between the new panels and the existing monoliths will be filled with a high-slump in-fill concrete to decrease seepage through the wall and provide structural support to the panels.  Further support to the pre-cast concrete panels will be supplied by a cast-in-place concrete anchor wall constructed landward of the canal face and connected to the panels by means of steel tie rods.  The pre-cast concrete panels will be covered by a cast-in-place concrete cap that will include checkposts for barge traffic.  The pre-cast concrete panels shall be tapered back to the existing wall at the upstream and downstream end of the project, which requires partial demolition of the existing wall.  In support of this, the canal wall adjacent to the demolition areas will be grouted with a low-strength leakage cutoff construction material to prevent water from leaking from the canal into Deep Run Creek.  Grouting the canal embankment with a low-strength material will decrease the amount of water leaking through the embankment and increase the structural integrity of the embankment.<BR><BR>During construction, operational facilities will be disturbed and will need to be repaired or replaced before completion of the construction project.  These facilities shall include, but not be limited to asphalt pavement, guardrail, security fencing, site lighting, utilities, etc.  <BR><BR>The construction contract will be awarded using competitive negotiation procedures for achieving the best value to the Government through the Source Selection Process.  Award of the contract will be made to the firm whose technical and price proposal combined, best meets the Government's needs in the most effective, economical, and timely manner.  The criteria used to determine best value to the Government in the form of a Technical Proposal and Price Proposal, will be outlined in the Solicitation in descending order of importance as follows:  Technical Approach, Work Plan, Method and work plan for constructing, delivering, and placing pre-cast wall panels, Method and work plan for grouting tie-in embankment sections, Emergency Response Plan, Detailed Work Plan, Network Analysis, & Schedule Bar Chart for Entire Work Period,  Major Plant & Equipment,  Corporate Management, Key Personnel Experience, Prime Contractor and Sub Contractor Experience, Organization Chart, Safety Plan, Past Performance,  Proposal Risk, Cost/Price, Price Proposal, Representations and Certifications,  Subcontracting Plan<BR><BR>THIS PROCUREMENT IS ISSUED UNRESTRICTED UNDER THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM (PUBLIC LAW 100-656). North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 and the size standard of $33.5 million average annual gross revenue. <BR><BR>The estimated order of magnitude for this project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000 million.   <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the plans and specifications for this procurement will be available on www.fbo.gov on or about 15 June 2009. Any contractor wanting the plans and specifications must download them from this website.

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The notice is to announce the revision of the contract maximum amount on the Raven-B Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV) spares contract supporting the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). This contract was awarded to AeroVironment Inc. in August 2008 as a Sole Source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with an anticipated period of performance through August 2011. The basis for this sole source action was FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), Only one Responsible source, as the Government does not own rights to the data needed to manufacture the required spare parts. This action was synopsized and no other company indicated the capability to manufacture the required spares. At time of award, the contract maximum for the three year period was $3,000,000. An engineering design modification to integrate a Digital Data Link (DDL) configuration change has generated the need for an adjustment to the contract maximum. To facilitate integration of the DDL into multiple spares contract line items and to obtain DDL retrofit kits, it is necessary to increase the contract maximum from $3M to $10M. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Port of Buenaventura Operational and Security Enhancement Feasibility Study, Colombia.
The Grantee (Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Buenaventura) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to evaluate existing conditions at the Port of Buenaventura; review current procedures and equipment at the port; determine and recommend improvements; prepare technical background material, and address the implementation of a container scanning facility.
The objective of the Port of Buenaventura Operational and Security Enhancement feasibility study in Colombia is to improve the monitoring and security of cargo transit at the Port of Buenaventura, the main terminal on Colombia’s Pacific coast.  The selected feasibility study contractor will evaluate existing conditions at the Port of Buenaventura; review current procedures and equipment at the port; determine and recommend improvements; prepare technical background material, and address the implementation of a container scanning facility.  Implementation measures would include the installation of advanced security technologies such as a Vessel Traffic System (VTS) to monitor the safe transit of vessels near Buenaventura’s coastline; Optical Character Recognition (OCR) equipment to record truck designations and container markings within the port; integration of container scanning equipment, and radiation detection and computerized integration of the existing closed circuit television network.
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Feasibility Study include the following tasks:
1) Data collection and review of existing conditions; 2) develop a vessel tracking system; 3) develop an optical character recognition system; 4) develop a computer monitoring system; 5) review of cargo inspection; 6) interim presentation; 7) development and environmental impacts; and 8) final report and presentation.
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.
Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT (MACC).<br /><br />45th Contracting Squadron, Patrick AFB, Florida is seeking interest of potential and eligible contractors for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC). This is a Sources Sought announcement, a market survey for written information only. This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources interested in providing work which includes all materials, labor, tools, equipment, transportation, and supervision, management and other services (including engineering/technical design support) necessary to accomplish non-complex minor construction, maintenance, repair, and renovation work on real property with minimum design requirements at Patrick AFB (PAFB) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS).
<p>The 45th Space Wing (45 SW) is seeking those firms with a demonstrated history of relevant construction experience where the primary focus is on IDIQ type contracts with simultaneous performance of multiple projects at differing locations similar to the task order value that will be executed under this contract. Every task order will be competed. Task Orders will be firm fixed price with a targeted award range of $100,000 to $300,000 with a minimum of $2,000 and a maximum of $1,000,000. Magnitude estimate is <br />$50 million to $100 million. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, Sector 23 Construction, Subsector 236 Construction of Buildings, Size Standard $33.5M; Subsector 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, Size Standard $33.5M (except Land Subdivision, $7M and Dredging and Surface Cleanup Activities, $20M); and Subsector 238 Specialty Trade Contractors, Size Standard, $14M. Description of work will be identified in each individual task order. The number of awards the Government will award is still under consideration, however at this point the Government anticipates awarding three contracts. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period with four 12-month option periods. Contract awards will be based on best value using past-performance-price trade-off procedures. In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Government the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements. While government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are encouraged to monitor the FedBizOpps website for program documents. Firms responding to this sources sought notice must (1) state whether they are a small or large business based on the size standard above; if applicable, identify subcontractors to be used and their anticipated responsibilities; (2) indicate all of the following small business status categories that apply: Small Disadvantaged (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), 8(a) firm, HUB Zone firm, Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business (SDVOB), Historically Black College and University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), (3) provide experience in the form of an outline of previous projects for specific relevant work completed or currently being performed of equivalent magnitude including contract numbers, description of work, points of contact, and phone numbers; professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel identified to perform the work; and (4) any other pertinent information which would enable the government to assess a firms capabilities. Because the government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for small business, 8(a) firms, HUB Zone firms or Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business based on the responses it receives, it is imperative that firms respond with the required information for capabilities to be accurately evaluated. Indicate if you plan on submitting under a Joint Venture Agreements (Joint Venture Agreements are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides) and if so, submit the names of companies planning to Joint Venture. Potential offerors should limit their responses to ten (10) pages. All information included in offeror responses should be specific to this Sources Sought Synopsis.</p>
<p><br />Please respond to this Sources Sought announcement by 12:00 p.m. (NOON). (Eastern Time) on 8 June 2009.</p>

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities
(MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Toothbrushes.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds Army Community Hospital, Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group, Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital, Fort Polk, LA.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is August 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.
The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Toothbrushes product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Toothbrushes product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.

B.	Products & Performance Required.

The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Toothbrushes, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.
Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $34,876.63.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.

At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .

C.	Instructions to Vendors.
Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil with (1) Company name and address,
(2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.

This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  

Prior to the closing date of this announcement please contact  Mrs.
Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 with any further questions.  The Tri-Service Regional Business Office is located at 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.

D.	Evaluation Criteria.  

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  

Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.
Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.
NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:
1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Toothbrush products.  A
complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  

a. Toothbrush, Adult Size Soft Bristle
b. Toothbrush, Childs Size Soft Bristle

2.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog,
etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
3.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Toothbrush product line.  Vendors should provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.
(Note: vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) 4.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal
Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be
disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
5.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified and where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.) Vendors are to provide quotes on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. 
6.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. 
7.  Vendors must supply toothbrushes that have American Dental Association seal of approval.
8.  Vendors must supply toothbrushes that are available in both child and adult sizes.
9.  Vendors must supply toothbrushes that are available individually wrapped in bulk.

Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.
Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by COB, 4PM CDT, on the fourteen (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for five (5) calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.
The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.

The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 

Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 

1. Bristles are free of sharp jagged edges and end points a. No abrasive edges to cause injury to the oral mucosa b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting c. Products will be observed for jagged edges and sharp end points

2. Bristle will not fall out with normal use a. Maintains form and structure to promote good oral care b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting c. Products will be inspected during the evaluation.
	
3. Size and shape of the brush fit in mouth comfortably a. Allows user to reach all areas easily b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting c. Products will be observed for comfort during evaluation

Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.
Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  

After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).
The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.
The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 22 June 2009 3PM CDT.

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, and Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities
(MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Baby Wipes.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, TX; Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland AFB, TX; Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX; Reynolds Army Community Hospital, Fort Sill, OK; William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX; 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO; Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, CO; General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital, Fort Leonard Wood, MO; Irwin Army Community Hospital, Fort Riley, KS; 99th Medical Group, Nellis AFB, NV; and Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital, Fort Polk, LA.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow the Prime Vendor to distribute their products.
This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding the DSCP Prime Vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods not to exceed five (5) years. Anticipated selection date is August 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  If the technical and clinical evaluation results are equal or nearly equal, price will become more important in the selection process.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Baby Wipes product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Baby Wipes product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.

B.	Products & Performance Required.

The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Baby Wipes, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $50,134.50.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the technical/company criteria below.

At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .

C.	Instructions to Vendors.
Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil with (1) Company name and address,
(2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.

This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  

Prior to the closing date of this announcement please contact  Mrs.
Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 with any further questions.  The Tri-Service Regional Business Office is located at 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.

D.	Evaluation Criteria.  

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of physicians, nurses, medical technicians, infection control officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  

Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.
Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.
Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.
NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted technical/company evaluation criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:

 Technical/Company Criteria:  during the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:  
1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Baby Wipe products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  
   	a.  Scented Baby Wipes
            b.  Unscented Baby Wipes 
            c.  Baby Wipes with aloe
            d.  Baby Wipes in Tub Container
            e.  Baby Wipes in travel size container

2.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog,
etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
3.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Baby Wipe product line.  Vendors must provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.
(Note: vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) 4.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal
Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note: vendors whose products are not available through the regional Prime Vendor will be
disqualified.)  Vendors must provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
5.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization
initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. 
6.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. 

Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptance of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.
Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.
NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for five (5) calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.
Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.

The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 

1. Baby Wipes are moist and contain enough solution to clean area without leaving wet residue. 
 
2. Baby Wipes are strong enough to prevent tearing during use.
     
3. Baby Wipes are thick and soft. 
       

Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.
Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical/company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified and where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  

After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who meet the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via e-mail.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration or participation.  

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The technical/company and clinical/performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  If the technical and clinical evaluation results are equal or nearly equal, price will become more important.
Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).
The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.
The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 22 June 2009 3PM CDT.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential small businesses (including HUBZone firms; certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this sources sought. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking to identify sources with the capabilities of providing a Differential Scanning Calorimeter System in accordance with the following specifications: 
Description: In general, differential scanning calorimetry is a method used to determine the thermodynamic constants governing diverse types of physical and chemical processes.  Conventional DSC instruments are used to characterize physical/chemical transformations occurring in medium-to-larger sample quantities (20 - 1,000 mg).  A specialized type of DSC instrument is required for the analysis of very small quantities (&#8805;0.02 mg) of potentially dangerous biomacromolecules.  It is unreasonably dangerous, unwise, and cost prohibitive to produce, store, or utilize the large quantities of dangerous protein toxins required for analysis by conventional DSC.  Bioterrorism and food safety studies on the stabilities of protein toxins (ricin, abrin, and shiga-like toxins) are performed by my laboratory using very small sample sizes, typically 0.01 - 0.05 mg.  For overwhelming safety and cost reasons, we require a DSC system capable of analyzing small amounts of very toxic proteins.
Performance Specifications:  The complete DSC system must satisfy the following critical elements: 
A.	Low short term Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).  0.5 microcalorie/°C (RMS average) when scanning from 5°C - 110°C at 90°C/hr scan rate using a 30 second time filter.  Low SNR is required for accurate integration of excess heat capacities to determine &#916;Hm or discern minor differences in &#916;Cp expected when using microgram quantities of protein samples.
B.	Appropriate scanning temperature range. -5°C to 130°C.  Measurements made far above normal cooking temperatures (200°C, or 400°F) are less relevant for most protein chemistry experiments and extended temperature ranges typical for conventional DSC are inappropriate for our planned studies.  Higher precision measurements of Tm should be expected with an instrument whose operating temperature range is focused in that expected for protein samples.
C.	Baseline reproducibility.  Standard deviation for replicate scans should be 1.5 microcalorie/°C within the temperature range typical for protein denaturation (5°C - 95°C) at 90°C/hr scan rate using a 30 second filter.
D.	Internal Peltier device.  External water baths cannot provide precise thermal control to the degree achieved by Peltier thermal control circuits.
E.	Maximum sensitivity. Thermodynamic measurements have been made using microcalorimetry DSC systems using as little as 0.0125 mg lysozyme.  Conventional DSC systems typically require 20 mg protein per analysis, a potentially lethal quantity for some of the toxins studied by our laboratory.
F.	Automated sample degassing/thermostatting. The DSC system must be equipped to perform reliable degassing and thermal equilibration of sample and reference materials prior to analysis.
G.	Minimal sample and reference chamber volumes.  The sample and reference chambers should contain &#8804;0.5 mL, minimizing the need for large sample volumes.
H.	Adjustable scan rates.  0°C/hr to 90°C/hr (heating mode); 0°C/hr to minus 60°C/hr (cooling mode).  Variable scan rates are required to study the mechanisms of protein toxin denaturation and renaturation.
I.	Biochemically inert sample and reference chamber materials. The sample and reference chambers must be constructed from temperature-resistant, biochemically inert materials.
J.	Adiabatic sample and reference chambers. The sample and reference chambers must be thermally isolated from the environment completely to allow small differences in excess heat capacity between the chambers to be reproducible and significant.
K.	Pressure perturbation calorimetry (PPC). The sample and reference chambers must be equipped for reliable PPC experiments at &#8805;5 atm.
L.	Integrated software/computer control.  A computer system (desktop or notebook computer with monitor, keyboard, mouse, no printer) is required for operation of the instrument and data analysis.  The computer system must provide adequate performance (processor speed, internal memory, card slots, disk space, etc.) required to operate the instrument control software.

The sources sought and pre-solicitation meeting is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for quotes and proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for/or award a competitive contract. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the FEDBIZOPPS. It is the potential sources responsibility to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS site for release of any solicitation or synopsis resulting from this announcement.<br /><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are completed for the new laboratory project that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a full and open competitive procurement and subsequently award a standalone contract. If the Government determines that enough qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside. Failure of small businesses to identify themselves at this time having the ability to act as a General Contractor will result in the solicitation being advertised full and open to both small and large business concerns.
<p>This procurement will utilize Recovery Act Funding.</p>
<p>NIST has a need for the new Building 1 Extension Laboratory that would meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>The laboratory would combine the features of close temperature control, vibration isolation, air cleanliness, and demanding power quality into a facility of crucial national importance. The B1E will consist of an L4 High Performance Lab, L5 Instrument Lab and L6 Precision. Temperature control will be achieved down to +/- 0.1 degree C in some areas, humidity control to +/- 5%, air filtration to M3.5 (class 100), and vibration control to &lt; 3 micrometers/second. At the B1E, electrical substations will be installed to transform site high voltage of 13.2 kV down to 480/277 V. State-of-the-art clean power quality will be required to meet stringent lab requirements and eliminate variables from scientific research. The new facility will provide for the current needs of quantum science research in computing and communications, nanotechnology, improved atomic clock research, high speed electronic measurements, and microfabrication of research devices.</p>
<p>The proposed B1E gross building area is approximately 210,000 square feet. Environmental and space requirements for the building are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's most technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1E cannot be economically met with renovated laboratory space; therefore, the B1E is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market.</p>
<p>The contract will consist of the interiors for the new laboratory as well as options for additional work to be completed in the period of performance of the interiors. The options are an additional boiler, chiller, liquid helium system, stair cuts, humidity control, gas bottle storage, duct banks, phone/data, security system, and building connector.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort as 236220, Commercial and Institutional building construction, and the small business size standard is $33.5 million.</p>
<p>After a determination is made on a small business set aside or open to all business concerns, the B1E interiors solicitation will be announced as a best value trade off process (FAR 15.101-1). The government will not pay for any information solicited. Offers that do not meet all the requirements or are not submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.</p>
<p>All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) prior to any award. To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 800-333-0505 or on line at <br />https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html.</p>

<p><br />Sources Sought Notice Information</p>
<p>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The NIAID provides immunological and virological support for nonhuman primate studies conducted at NIAID's Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit contract sites (SVEUs) and by AIDS vaccine researchers through three Nonhuman Primate Immunology and Virology Laboratories for AIDS Vaccine Research and Development, previously called the NHP "Core Laboratories." The objective of the Core Laboratories has been to insure standardization and comparability of the assays conducted for preclinical NHP studies and to provide a common basis for assessment of the immunogenicity and efficacy of candidate HIV and SIV vaccines.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives <br />The purpose of the proposed contract will be to support the development, conduct, and improvement of assays designed to evaluate and characterize the cellular immune responses of nonhuman primates that have been immunized with candidate HIV or SIV vaccines or infected with SIV, SHIV, or HIV in studies conducted at the NIAID Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit (SVEU) contract sites or by NIH-supported investigators.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />The contractor shall use state-of-the-art technologies, including ELISPOT, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), flow cytometry, and tetramer assays to accomplish the contract objectives, and shall incorporate new and improved technologies into contract activities when appropriate. The contractor will be expected to pursue the development of assays to detect immune responses in mucosal tissues, including assays that are able to detect virus-specific responses using small numbers of cells. The contractor will use GLP processes to conduct assays when assessing cellular immune responses in NHP studies conducted with human clinical candidate AIDS vaccines, to allow the assay results to be compared with assays being conducted with the same vaccines in human clinical studies.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br />The performance requirement will be for the delivery of 7.6 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the base period (Year 1) and option periods (Year 2 through Year 7), which may be unilaterally exercised by the Government. The option periods may extend the term of the contract beyond the base period for up to 7 years. In addition, the Government may exercise options to accommodate significant increases in work to be provided for the base period and option periods. Should the Government elect to exercise this option, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume for up to .95 FTE's for each option exercised. The Government may exercise these options up to two times within each performance year.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking alternative sources and no-cost samples of a light-duty mat in support of the Expeditionary Airfield Program in accordance with the attached Performance Specification.  Bid samples will be utilized for testing and will not be returned.

The Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Concept is a shorebased, aviation weapons support system which permits deployment of landing force aircraft within an effective range of ground forces. This concept allows for the construction of portable, reusable, forward-deployed airfields which can be assembled in a building block concept for the rapid introduction of air power. These airfields are fabricated from aluminum panels, designated AM2 Mat. The AM2 Mat expanses can be assembled to form an airfield’s runways, taxiways, parking areas, and other areas required for aircraft operations and maintenance.  While AM2 Mat is a highly capable medium-duty, battle-proven airfield surfacing system, the substantial weight and cube embarkation profile of this system is slowly reducing the operational capability and feasibility of deploying this system for all applications.  Some operational commanders have elected not to employ the use of the only airfield surfacing system in the inventory.  The direction of the Marine Corps is advancing towards reliance on a small, lightweight MEU concept with heavy use of rotary aircraft such as the CH46, CH53, AH1 and UH1, as well as the V22 Tilt-Rotor aircraft. These aircraft do not require an airfield surfacing system that can withstand high impact/wheel loads.   A light-duty mat would be more practical and mobile to support the parking, ground operations and air taxiing of these aircraft.  This type of mat would have the ability to be installed, removed and repositioned rapidly as the front moves forward and would not be required to withstand the high thermal profiles of the JSF or AV8B. The light-duty mat must, at a maximum, be 10% of the weight of the present AM2 Mat and 33% of the volume of AM2 Mat.  AM2 Mat weighs 6.5 pounds per square foot and has a volume of .25 cubic feet per linear foot. The light-duty mat must have the ability to withstand direct impingement of exhaust temperatures not to exceed 600 degrees F, for a maximum of one minute, without loss of strength.

All interested sources with qualified systems are encouraged to respond to this synopsis to identify their devices, qualifications and production status no later than 29 June 2009.  All responses should be forwarded to Ms. Christine Somerset, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Hwy 547, Lakehurst, NJ  08733-5082.  Ms. Somerset may be reached at 732-323-1600 or christine.somerset@navy.mil. All Bid Samples should be forwarded to Mr. Ralph Paz, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Hwy 547, Lakehurst, NJ  08733-5082.    Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from this RFI.  The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside of the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this "sources sought" is to identify hotels willing to provide meeting space, lodging, and meals in the Saint Louis, MO area, in light of new guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs.</p>
<p>Two of the new requirements prescribe limits for meals and refreshments served at breaks. Regarding meals, the new guideline states that the cost of any meal provided, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 150 percent of the locality M&amp;IE per meal. For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $59.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $11.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $16.50 ($11.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $59.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $16.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $24.00 ($16.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>The new guideline defines refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins. Under the new guidelines the cost of these items, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality (M&amp;IE) for both morning and afternoon breaks.

OSMs primary objectives are to ensure that coal mine surface activities are operated in a manner that protects citizens and the environment during mining and to assure that the land is restored to beneficial use following mining.BackgroundWithin the OSM, there is an Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO) which is responsible for promoting equal employment opportunities for all OSM employees and ensuring a diverse workplace.  Diversity encompasses acceptance, respect and understanding that each individual is unique, and has individual differences not only in race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs and most important, ideologies.  OEOs goal is to help managers, supervisors and employees better understand diversity and move beyond tolerance to embracing and celebrating the differences in each individual.  Diversity brings a greater skills base when managed properly; improves the overall climate, reduces conflicts and encourages creativity, flexibility and innovation among all employees which allows the injection of new ideas.  Based on this fact, OEOs objective is to conduct team building workshops in our regional and field offices that will foster more positive working relationships among managers, supervisors and employees.Scope of WorkAs part of the team building portion of the workshop, we want a personality assessment completed by the participants in order to assist them in recognizing and learning to appreciate the diversity of communication and working styles of all members of a team.  Upon completion of the workshop, participants will be equipped with a better understanding of how our diverse styles can be leveraged to resolve workplace problems and work together more effectively.  Our expectation is for the facilitator to follow the interactive guide and the accompanying book, Follow Your True Colors to the Work You Love.

BACKGROUND

U.S. Agency for International Development’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) provides grants for food assistance to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) and the UN World Food Program (WFP) under Title II of Public Law 480.  In fiscal year 2007, FFP provided 2.1 million metric tons of commodities, worth over $1.8 billion, to over 40 million people in 64 countries.  FFP provides both emergency food aid (which aims to address food aid needs arising from natural disasters, such as floods or droughts, and complex emergencies often characterized by insecurity and population displacement) and non-emergency food aid (which aims to address the underlying causes of chronic food insecurity).

Liberia faces a host of complex food issues requiring Title II food assistance. Notably among them are:
•	Chronic malnutrition is estimated at 39% and severe malnutrition has increased from 4% in December 2006 to 8% in June 2008
•	Consumer price index is 16.5%
•	Over half of urban incomes are spent on food. Most rural households spent on food and most rural households engage in subsistence food production, but two-third of their income is also spent on food,
•	It is estimated that 60% of rice consumed nationally is imported
•	Recent surveys estimate that 68% of rural households and 55% of urban households live below the poverty line, while 56% of rural households and 29% of urban households live below the extreme poverty line. 

In FY 2008, Liberia received $9,414,000 million in Title II food assistance, of which $7,672,500 million was non-emergency food aid and $ 1,741,500 million was for emergency programs.  In FY 2009, it is anticipated that there will be one multi-year non-emergency programs managed by PVOs, valued at $9 million and emergency food aid will continue due to the most urgent food needs of beneficiaries including populations affected by conflict and food-insecure households. Moreover, this will also address the impact of the current food price increase on extremely vulnerable persons/populations. Areas of intervention include: 1. Food Support for Local Initiative (FSLI) with activities such as Food for Agriculture, FFW-Rehabilitation of Damaged Infrastructure, and FFT-Life Skills and Vocational/Literacy Training. 2. Nutrition-to support supplementary feeding programs in areas with high acute malnutrition rates to improve the nutritional status of children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women. 3. General Food Distribution- to support Ivorian refugees living in camps

Title II food aid grants are signed by the Director of FFP, and the FFP/Washington Country Backstop Officer is usually the Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) who is responsible for the technical oversight of the grants.  The USAID Mission has overall responsibility for assistance programs in the country.

To help determine the need for and improve, monitor, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the assistance provided by the Title II Food aid program in Liberia, USAID/Monrovia requires the services of a FFP Officer hired through a Personal Services Contract.  The position is based in Monrovia, but the FFP Officer is expected to spend approximately forty (40) percent of his/her time traveling throughout the country to monitor program activities and assess food aid needs.  

BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION

The FFP Officer will ensure effective management of FFP resources in Liberia.  His/her primary responsibility is to monitor Title II-funded non-emergency food aid programs, and report on their implementation to FFP/Washington and the Mission.    

MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The FFP Officer will undertake the following duties:

1.	Serve as point of contact for all issues pertaining to Title II food aid in Liberia for the Mission, Embassy, USAID/Washington, the regional FFP Office, other parts of the U.S. government, PVOs, international organizations, host nation governmental ministries and agencies, and others in the country.

2.	Monitor and report on implementation of ongoing Title II programs, including progress and problems encountered by grantees, as well as commodity management, including following up with cooperating sponsors on the status of loss claims.

3.	Provide information and guidance to Title II assistance award recipients on Title II regulations, policies and procedures.

4.	Report on all food security issues, to include changes in the food security situation and food aid requirements, government policies and actions affecting food aid programs, government food aid programs, and donor pledges and programs.

5.	Coordinate with the Country Team (consisting of the USAID Mission, U.S. Embassy, and/or other USG staff in-country), host government, PVOs, international organizations, donors, and others to address issues impacting Title II food aid.

6.	Undertake and report on assessments to inform Title II food aid funding decisions or modifications to ongoing programs.

7.	Work with PVOs on preparation of annual work plans and program modifications, and with WFP on new appeals or revisions to existing ones.

8.	Work with other parts of the U.S. government and other donors to promote integration of food aid with other programs to increase the effectiveness of the programs overall.

9.	When delegated authority to do so by the FFP Director, serve as CTO for Title II programs (when delegated by the FFP Director).

10.	Supervise assigned FSN staff.

11.	Undertake other tasks, as assigned.

The basic duties and responsibilities do not change between the GS 13 and GS 14 levels.  An employee meeting the qualifications for GS 14 and hired at that level, however, is expected to exercise a higher level of autonomy and require less technical support from the Mission, FFP/Washington and the Regional FFP Office.  

Individuals hired at the GS-13 level who, during the course of the contract meet the GS-14 minimum requirements, can be considered for promotion based on performance.

9.	POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervision Received:  The FFP Officer will be supervised on a day-to-day basis by the Economic Growth Team Leader, but is expected to be in regular contact with FFP/Washington, as well as the regional FFP Office, and report any information to them on issues pertaining to ongoing Title II programs.  
  
Available Guidelines:  The position requires an understanding of an array of U.S. Government and Agency regulations and comprehension of host-country regulations and practices as they affect USAID/Liberia operations.

Exercise of Judgment:  The Contractor must exercise sound and independent judgment in interpreting and applying U.S. Government and USAID-specific regulations and standard operating procedures in the course of carrying out the assigned duties.

Authority to Make Commitments:  The incumbent is not authorized to make any commitments on behalf of USAID/Liberia or the U.S. Government unless such authority is specifically delegated.

Nature, Level and Purpose of Contacts:  The Contractor will establish and maintain solid working relationships with all levels of Mission personnel with USAID/Liberia staff.  The Contractor will have frequent working contacts with U.S. Embassy officers in Liberia, host government officials, PVOs, NGOs, and private sector entities to fulfill the major duties and responsibilities of this contract.  Often these contacts will be of a sensitive nature and discretion is required.

Supervision Exercised:  The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently.  The supervisor will provide policy and management direction in terms of goals and objectives.  The incumbent will work with the supervisor to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be done.  However, the incumbent is expected to use initiative, resourcefulness, and creativity in pursuing and attaining the goals and objectives set for the completion of his/her job expectations.  As assigned by the USAID/Liberia Economic Growth Team Leader, the Contractor will supervise one or more USAID/Liberia foreign national staff who have Food For Peace-related management responsibilities.

Interpersonal Skills:  The Contractor must exercise discretion and tact in a variety of stressful situations and when dealing with personnel to resolve challenges that arise during the course of the work, for which there often is not a clear solution.

Time required to Perform a Full Range of Duties:  Immediately.  The incumbent is expected to be skilled in program/project management and coordination so that s/he can be able to carry out the duties and responsibilities from day one.

Period of Performance:  The personal service contract will be for 1 year, with possibility of extension.  Extensions will be contingent on the need for continued services, satisfactory performance, and availability of funds.

Reports:  Upon request or as scheduled, the Contractor will submit periodic status and/or other reports related to major activities or projects that fall under the incumbent’s responsibility.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only seeking responses from Small Businesses.  Large and Non Profit Businesses are not to respond.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the 541611 NAICS Code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only. After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time. 

The Division of Contracts Management (DCM), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), provides centralized contract support to the SAMHSA Centers and Offices, but does not maintain adequate resources to support the number of contract proposal reviews that require detailed cost and price analysis and financial audits.  Often, multiple proposal reviews must be performed concurrently within a limited amount of time.  With the increasingly high number of contract/modification proposals requiring detailed cost and price analysis, supplemental ad hoc support is necessary.  This support also includes cost realism analysis, as outlined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.305 and 15.404.  The majority of contracts awarded by SAMHSA are cost-reimbursement performance-based contracts.

SAMHSA requires financial management support to determine the allowability, allocability, and reasonableness of proposed costs; financial capability of contractor organizations; and adequacy of accounting and other financial management systems for administering Federal contracts.  Specific tasks to be performed by the contractor, as further described below, include cost and price analysis and audit support for the review of business proposals for new performance-based contracts and bilateral contract modifications; audit support services for review of contract invoices and closeouts; and general financial management support.  It is anticipated that one (1) full-time equivalent (FTE) cost analyst position will be required for performance of the Statement of Work.   As separate optional tasks, up to two (2) additional cost analysts will also be required. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four one year option periods.  Documented cost analysis and cost realism review experience for large dollar complex projects and programs is required in response to this Sources Sought, which includes the following tasks:

Task 1:  Cost and Price Analysis

The contractor shall conduct cost and price analysis of SAMHSA contract proposals involving analysis where there is little or no cost history data and proposals that involve new procurement and contract changes.  These analyses generally form the basis of the government’s cost/price negotiation position for such elements and costs.  

The analysis shall include an evaluation of the reasonableness, allowability, and allocability of the proposed estimated costs.

It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program, via the United States Army Medical Material Center, Europe (USAMMCE). <BR><BR>	The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Portugal (Azores), U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, and U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Command (MEDCOM), and U. S. Army Central Command (CENTCOM).<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is September 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR><BR>Point of Contact is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>1.	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Airways-Oral & Nasopharyngeal, which at a minimum, includes the product lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $497,150.00.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume usage line items for this project include but are not limited to Airways-Oral & Nasopharyngeal in following items in different styles and sizes (sizes are in French (Fr) units or mmL units of measurement).<BR>a.	Airway Nasopharyngeal PVC Sterile Sizes 24, 26, 36 (Fr)<BR>b.	Airway Nasopharyngeal Latex Sterile Sizes 26, 28, 30, (Fr)<BR>c.	Airway Nasopharyngeal Latex non-Sterile Sizes 28, 32 (Fr)<BR>d.	Airway Oral Guedel Sizes 80, 90,100 (mmL)<BR>e.	Airway Oral Berman Sizes 80, 100 (mmL)<BR>2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as listed above will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>3.	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of these products, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) information, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must e-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer. <BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process<BR><BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.<BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>	a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>	b. The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>2.   Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability. This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR>3.  The vendors who meet the following technical /company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR>4.	 The following eleven (11) equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative and vendors must provide a response to the following criteria by the closing date of the FBO.<BR>a.

The Europe TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process<BR><BR>Clinical Evaluation Process<BR>The Europe CPT determined/approved the product samples sets are required for the evaluation in a clinical (patient care) setting.  Requested samples will only include high-volume products.  Based on this determination, the following procedures will apply.  <BR>1.	To avoid shipping delays caused by Europes Customs Offices, the Europe Region TRBO office requires  sample sets from each qualifying vendor to be sent directly to the Europe Region TRBO via e-mail address robert.halliday@us.army.mil or USPS to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Robert Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>2.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship product samples / literature for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of samples by COB on the 14th calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply samples will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send Europe Region TRBO Point of Contact (POC) verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and the anticipated delivery date via e-mail digitally signed.  Verification of shipment is defined as sending the Europe Region TRBO a copy of the USPS PS form 2976-A customs form.  The PS form 2976-A will have a stamped date the package was accepted by USPS.  Vendors whose packages have a stamped date after the established notification to ship deadline date will be disqualified from this standardization process.<BR>3.	Vendors must provide, the only following no cost product samples for clinical or performance evaluation (Unused samples will not be returned.)  <BR>a.	The Oral and Nasopharyngeal samples (latex-free only) to be provided will include 5 of each (size as stated with each product line below) per MTF (6 MTFs) and 1 of each size for the Europe TRBO to be provided as follows.<BR>1)	Nasopharyngeal 30Fr<BR>2)	Nasopharyngeal 32Fr<BR>3)	Nasopharyngeal 34Fr<BR>4)	Oropharyngeal 80mmL<BR>5)	Oropharyngeal 90mmL<BR>6)	Oropharyngeal 100mmL<BR>b.	Samples are to be shipped to the Europe Region TRBO.  NOTE:  The Europe Region TRBO shipping address is written in item #1 above.  The Europe Region TRBO requests sample orders be separated by MTF.  The Europe Region TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>4.	Specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative:<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process.<BR>e.	Each of the clinical criteria will be evaluated 5 times by each participating MTF. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for thirty (30) calendar days.<BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<BR>	During the pre-source selection procedures, the Europe CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.<BR>1.	Patient Safety - The product is durable.<BR>a.	An oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway needs to be durable due to use in a body cavity where the possibility of the item breaking down would cause harm to the patient.<BR>b.	The evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the material used to construct the item is acceptable.	<BR>2.	Patient Safety - The oropharyngeal airway provides or has an opening/channel that allows a smooth passage of a catheter for suctioning.<BR>a.	An oropharyngeal airway must allow or provide an opening allowing the patients airway to be adequately suctioned.<BR>b.	The valuator will visually inspect the product, confirming the capability of using suction when the need arises.<BR>3.	Safety in urgent care setting  Packaging and or color identifies the size and style of the oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway.<BR>a.	The package identification reduces the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate size for urgent patient care.<BR>b.	The evaluator will visually inspect the package label, making sure the color, size, and style information properly identifies the respective oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway.<BR>4.	The two airway evaluation forms, one for the nasopharyngeal airways and the second for the oropharyngeal airways, will be evaluated by using a combination, not all, of the approved clinical/performance criteria as above.  The airway evaluation forms will use the following clinical/performance criteria.<BR>a.	The nasopharyngeal airway evaluation form  Criteria 1, 2, &3<BR>b.	The oropharyngeal airway evaluation form  Criteria 1 & 3<BR>			<BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs.).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods.<BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting matrix.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.<BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.

<RESPDATE>062209
<CONTACT>Kevin Hill, Technical Director, Phone 210 292-3270, Fax 210 292-3237, Email kevin.hill.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil - Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, Phone 210 292-3287, Fax 210 292-3237, Email sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil
<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Tourniquets.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is August 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Tourniquets product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Tourniquets product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.

B.	Products & Performance Required.

The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Tourniquets, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $101,968.66.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.

At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .

C.	Instructions to Vendors.
Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil with (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.

This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  

Prior to the closing date of this announcement please contact  Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 with any further questions.  The Tri-Service Regional Business Office is located at 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.

D.	Evaluation Criteria.  

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  

Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.
NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:

Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:  
1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Tourniquet products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:
a. Tourniquets used for the purpose of blood drawing which are ½ to ¾ inches 
    wide by 12 to14 inches in length.
b. Tourniquets used for the purpose of blood drawing which are ¾ to 1 inches 
    wide by 16 to 18 inches in length. 
2.	Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
3.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the tourniquet product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
4.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
5.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. 
6.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
7.	Vendors must offer latex and latex free tourniquets.


Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for five (5) calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.

The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 
1.  Tourniquet is easy to apply and release.
    
2.  Tourniquet has a smooth finish.
       
3.  Tourniquet retains stretch and elasticity. 
      
Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  

After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 22 June 2009 3PM CDT

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open CompetitionFire Stop Survey Service for Joint CommissionPer the requirements set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Parts 6.302, 6.303, and 6.304 the following justification and approval is made regarding the procurement for Fire Stop Service Survey for the Boise VA Medical Center. This award is for JHC Firestop Inc, which is a Service Disabled, Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) sole source procurement and competitive procedures will not be used.  The format for this justification is from the FAR part 6.303-2 and presented in the format prescribed.1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a justification for other than full and open competition.Agency:  			U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs	Contracting Activity:		Contracting Officer (90C)					VA Medical Center Boise, Idaho					500 West Fort St. 					Boise, Idaho 837022.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  This justification and approval is for procuring the above stated service.  This survey is offered by few venders based on my market research and the only one to the best of my knowledge that is a SDVOSB.     3.	A description of the supplies or services required in order to meet the agencies needs (including the estimated value).  A VA2237, 531-09-3-5410-0023 and requirements documents were sent to contracting on 19 March, 2009.   Upon further research, I found that the nature of this service falls under a broad NAICS code 541350 Building Inspection Services. However the nature of this fire stop work is very specialized and under review for a separate NAICS code.  This survey will inspect and correct seven different buildings at the Boise VA Medical Center which will include all fire barriers between floors, installing fire stop materials and preparing a report identifying with photographs the locations of sealed penetrations that do not meet criteria. Independent Government Estimate for this survey, corrective actions and report is $75,000.00.   4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The statutory authority allowing use of other than full and open competition for this requirement is FAR Part 6.302-1(b) (1)(i) (services available from only one source will satisfy the agency requirements) and VAAR 873.104 (a) and (b). This service is being set aside as a sole source to JHC Fire Stop (SDVOSB) per Public Law (PL) 109-461 pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127.  5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. This service is set aside to a SDVOSB with extensive past performance experience with Veterans Affairs Hospitals to include our VISN20 region.   6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  My determination is based on using a known SDVOSB as allowed by statute and past performance with this contractor.7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  Pricing will be examined upon receiving the bid price and comparing this to the IGE and similar work performed within the VA VISN20 area.  8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  I looked at VetBiz and CCR to determine business that provides this service.  In addition I called other VA contracting officers who recently awarded this type of contract to determine availability of this service by a SDVOSB.9.	Any other facts support the use of other than full and open competition.  Nothing else beyond what is documented above.10.	A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. N/A.11.	A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  Competing this procurement and potentially using another vendor would not benefit the administrative effort by the Government due to the past performance for this specific service previously done for the VA and within the VISN20 region which also is a SDVOSB. 12.	I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that this procurement action is made in good faith with regard for the public interest.//SIGNED//John MacBrideContracting SpecialistApprove//SIGNED//John KoppVISN 20 East Branch Acquisition Manager

<DESC>DME MAC Re-competes: Jurisdictions A, B, and D
Questions for Industry

Background

In 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA), Public Law 108-173. This Act amended Title XVIII of the Social Security Act by establishing the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) contracting authority (section 911 of the MMA). The MMA required that all Medicare claims processing and related functions performed by the previous fiscal intermediaries and carriers under the Medicare fee-for-service program be competed and awarded to the new MACs through use of federal procurement procedures. 

In 2006, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded three Durable Medical Equipment (DME) MAC contracts to administer Medicare claims for DME benefits in jurisdictions A, B, and D (see CMS’ website at  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicareContractingReform/ for more detail regarding the DME MAC jurisdictions). Under the MMA, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must re-compete MAC contracts at least every five (5) years. Therefore, CMS intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the contracts for DME MAC jurisdictions A, B, and D by the end of calendar year 2009.   

Model Technical Proposal Instructions

The CMS is considering modifications to its Technical Proposal instructions for the DME MAC RFP. Rather than requiring offerors to submit full written, Technical Proposals or make traditional in-person oral presentations, CMS is considering requiring offerors to submit the majority of their Technical Proposals in a video/multimedia presentation (NOTE: The CMS may also use this approach in future MAC procurements, including those for Medicare Part A and B claims processing services). The proposed instructions for this video/multimedia presentation are listed below.

•	Videos/multimedia presentations shall be submitted on a single 8.54 GB (single-sided double-layer) +R DVD.
•	The DVD shall contain the video/multimedia presentation of the offeror’s Technical Proposal for those criteria identified in section L (For the purposes of this RFI, refer to the sample criteria on page 2).
•	The video/multimedia presentation submitted by offerors shall be fully compliant with the standards found in section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended in 1998. Specifically:

§ 1194.24 Video and multimedia products.

(c) All training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agency's mission, regardless of format, that contain speech or other audio information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be open or closed captioned.

(d) All training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agency's mission, regardless of format, that contain visual information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be audio described.

(e) Display or presentation of alternate text presentation or audio descriptions shall be user-selectable unless permanent.

•	The video/multimedia presentation of the Technical Proposal shall not exceed 15 minutes per sub-chapter.
•	The video/multimedia presentation shall be organized into chapters and sub-chapters and in the same format and order as the technical evaluation criteria. These chapters and sub-chapters must be accessible via a main DVD menu. An example (from past MAC procurements) of evaluation criteria that would be presented on the DVD and proposed organization could be:

Chapter 1.	Technical Understanding
Sub-Chapter 1.	Program Management
Sub-Chapter 2.	Claims Processing
Sub-Chapter 3.	Provider Customer Service Program
Sub-Chapter 4.	Appeals
Sub-Chapter 5.	Medical Review
Chapter 2.	Implementation
Sub-Chapter 1.	Implementation Approach
Sub-Chapter 2.	Implementation Risk Management Plan

•	At the end of each sub-chapter, the offeror shall restate all technical innovations proposed for that section of the technical proposal.
•	The offeror shall submit the following supplemental files on the DVD:
&#61485;	Slide presentations in MS PowerPoint 2003 format (e.g., charts, graphs, and flowcharts).
&#61485;	Transcripts of spoken dialogue.
No other supplemental files shall be included on the DVD. Any information submitted in supplemental files that was not discussed during the presentation may not be considered in evaluating an offeor’s Technical Proposal.
•	Only Key Personnel shall present the offeror’s Technical Proposal in the DVD presentation. Key Personnel shall present on those criteria that represent their area of oversight and/or expertise. For example, the Claims Processing Manager would be required to present on a claims processing factor/sub-factor.

In addition to this video/multi-media presentation, CMS intends to continue to request certain elements of the Technical Proposal in writing using Microsoft Word 2003 format. Examples (from past MAC procurements) of elements that would be requested in writing could include:
•	Past Performance
•	Staffing Plan,
•	Key Personnel,
•	Implementation Personnel, and
•	Corporate Experience.

Questions for Industry 

Based upon past procurement experience and/or industry best practices, please provide your comments on these model RFP instructions for CMS’ consideration, including comments on topics such as:

1.	How much time would you need to prepare your Technical Proposal in accordance with the instructions identified above?
2.	Is the time allotted (15 minutes per sub-chapter) a reasonable amount of time for a presentation? Would you prefer an overall limit to the presentation (e.g., two hours)?
3.	What are your overall questions/concerns with CMS’ proposed approach to use a video/multimedia presentation for offerors’ Technical Proposals? Would you prefer the use of traditional in-person oral presentations? 
4.	In addition to the model instructions provided above, are there additional instructions and/or parameters that CMS needs to address to ensure that offerors understand what they need to provide in their submission and to ensure that CMS gets the information it needs to make informed judgments regarding offerors’ proposed technical approaches?
5.	Is there another media source (other than DVD) that CMS should consider for the video/multimedia presentation?
6.	Do you recommend a different format/structure for the video/multimedia presentation (other than what is described in the model Technical Proposal instructions)? Are there additional elements of a technical proposal that CMS has historically requested in a written proposal that you feel could be presented in the video/multi-media presentation?
7.	What is an appropriate page limits for slides used in your presentation?

Please provide your response to this Request for Information (RFI) at the email address (MAC_PROCUREMENT@cms.hhs.gov) no later than close of business Tuesday, March 24, 2009.  Responses should be submitted as an email attachment in Microsoft Word 2003 format.  

For purposes of this RFI, the term “vendor” refers to those members of industry providing responses to this RFI.  The vendor should identify any proprietary information in their RFI responses.  Proprietary materials will neither be distributed to nor discussed with any other vendor.  

CMS will use the information submitted in response to this RFI at its discretion and will not provide comments to any vendor’s submission.  However, responses to the RFI submitted may be reflected in the final solicitation. CMS reserves the right to contact any vendor that responds to this RFI for the sole purpose of enhancing CMS’ understanding of your RFI submission. 

This notice is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this RFI and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with any RFI submissions.

<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>Defense Logistics Agency</p>
<p>Defense Supply Center Richmond</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROGRAM OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) is seeking information in an attempt to develop a strategic closed-loop recycled antifreeze program at various Federal and Military locations throughout the United States. Presently there are no closed-loop recycled antifreeze programs within the Department of Defense (DoD).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DSCR's intention is to increase &lsquo;greener' product use, reduce hazardous waste streams, and enhance compliance with environmental laws and regulations through implementation of this program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, DSCR's goal is to reduce new material purchase costs as well as reduce costs associated with handling, storage and disposal of spent product.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Scope of Project:</strong></p>
<p>This initiative is designed to provide a strategic, nation-wide closed-loop approach whereby the contractor supplies recycled antifreeze, manages the pickup of used antifreeze, recylces used antifreeze received, and disposes of excess used antifreeze in accordance with environmental rules and regulations. This initiative includes the following DSCR managed NSNs:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a noncompetitive purchase order to SafeNet, Inc. 1655 North Fort Myer Drive, Suite 1150 for upgrade and maintenance of SafeNet Security Management Encryptors.

This purchase will be made as an Other than Full and Open Competition as authorized by 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". The anticipated award date is  June 2009. This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

The justification for this sole source procurement is only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This procurement is a continuation of existing services in support of existing “SafeNet” hardware.  The vendor has to be SafeNet because the hardware already in the production network is from this vendor.  Therefore,  the network management server software would have to be from the same vendor.  If  ENM was unable to upgrade the SMC they would be unable to support the customer in their encryption requirements in a timely fashion as well as any future requirements.


Market Research was not conducted because  this is a continuation of existing services so no other vendors were considered

<RESPDATE>061509
<CONTACT>Marcus L. Moses, Contract Specialist, Phone 2024931341, Email marcus.moses@dot.gov
<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) intends to award a Broad Agency Announcement that will utilize other than full and open competition procedures and limit responses to only Class I Railroad carrier companies.  The purpose of this effort is to initiate a Risk Reduction Program (RRP) which is an FRA-led industry-wide initiative to reduce accidents and injuries, and build strong safety cultures, by developing innovative methods, processes, and technologies to identify and correct individual and systemic contributing factors using “upstream” predictive data. 

The Class I carriers include the following railroads:

BNSF Railway Company, Fort Worth, Texas
CSX Transportation, Jacksonville, Florida
Canadian National Railway, Montreal, Quebec
Canadian Pacific Railway, Calgary, Alberta
Kansas City Southern, Kansas City, Missouri
Norfolk Southern Railway, Norfolk, Virginia
Union Pacific Railroad, Omaha, Nebraska  

Limiting competition will help the RRP develop for various reasons.  Due to the RRP being in the very early stages, the FRA wants to conduct a limited competition to Class I Railroads that will focus on potential pilot programs already being developed by these carriers.  The Class I carriers are, in many instances, already working to develop proactive safety programs.  Selecting from their ranks will mean that the first Risk Reduction pilot projects will likely be more developmentally mature than might be the case if FRA were to select from an organization that was still trying to learn the basic concepts behind proactive risk reduction.  In addition, the Class I carriers are by their natures very large and complex operations, which may enable development of pilot programs that include larger geographic territories, more employees, or greater complexity.  Pilot projects that include both of the benefits described, i.e. greater developmental advancement as well as larger pilot sites, may speed the development of results that can be used to shape the regulation required by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008.  Lastly, the FRA believes that the Class I carriers, if allowed to participate in the RRP, will be well situated (in terms of staff, revenue, and experience) to provide advice and assistance to smaller entities that may subsequently join the program.

This requirement is being advertised as Other Than Full and Open Competition under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302. The purpose of this notice is to satisfy the requirements of FAR Subpart 5.2. THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT ONLY. Therefore, no solicitation document is available at this time.

<SOLNBR>WRAD-09-0520-NFFS7300-9-13122
<RESPDATE>061509
<CONTACT>Maria L Mendoza, Phone (206)526-6671, Email Maria.L.Mendoza@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Marine Research Limited. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will conduct work required to complete an assessment of South Pacific humpback whales.
<p>Background<br />Management of marine mammal populations falls within the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 and, for some species, under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. The agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction, and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery, and safeguard the quality of their habitat. In the northwestern U.S., the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) is partly responsible for overseeing and partially funding research on marine mammals, notably those populations listed as Strategic Stocks. AFSC scientists also collaborate with various international organizations on topics relating to marine mammals in other oceans, including the International Whaling Commission (IWC). In this latter capacity, they have been extensively involved in assessments of IWC humpback whales in the Southern Hemisphere and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Humpback stocks breeding in the South Pacific (in Oceania and off eastern Australia) are known to be complex (genetically and demographically sub-structured). Those in the Oceania region (including New Caledonia, Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Tonga) show an apparently variable pattern of recovery from exploitation. Some regions nearby show strong trends in abundance (eastern Australia, Noad et al. 2008; Western Australia, Bannister and Hedley 2001) while others show little apparent recovery (e.g. Fiji, New Zealand). Recent photo-ID catalogue comparisons show a low rate of migratory exchange between Oceania and eastern Australia (Garrigue et al. 2007b) and limited interchange within Oceania (Garrigue et al. 2007a). High maternal genetic diversity across Oceania is likely to have been maintained by population sub-structuring on breeding grounds (Olavarr&iacute;a et al. 2007). Extensive 20th century exploitation of these stocks on their seasonal Antarctic feeding grounds is therefore likely to have resulted in multiple regional population declines or "bottlenecks" on humpback breeding grounds across Oceania. However the extent to which animals from these breeding grounds mix on feeding grounds is still unknown, which poses a considerable challenge for the reconstruction of breeding population histories.</p>
<p>At a 2006 IWC workshop in Hobart, Australia, a number of stock structure scenarios were discussed for this region (IWC 2006). Assessments of the most complex scenarios are hindered by the difficulty of allocating Antarctic whaling catches to individual breeding populations. However, assessment of the breeding stocks of Oceania is a specific research priority of the IWC, and is required for the ongoing Comprehensive Assessment of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales.</p>
<p>Conducting an assessment of the status of humpback populations in the South Pacific region is complicated by the challenge of catch allocation; all humpbacks share feeding grounds in the Antarctic south of 40&deg;S and between 120&deg;E and 110&deg;W (IWC management Areas V and VI), where the most substantial 20th century catches were taken. The division between Areas V and VI is directly south of the Tongan breeding population, one of the most abundant populations in the region (Baker et al. 2006). Microsatellite genotyping has connected animals from Tonga with three feeding Areas (Steel et al. 2008), illustrating the difficulty of allocating feeding Area catches to individual breeding populations with accuracy. Previous population assessments of humpbacks wintering in the South Pacific have focused on the eastern Australian population (Johnston and Butterworth 2005) and on all South Pacific stocks (eastern Australia and Oceania) combined (Jackson et al. 2006). Jackson et al. (2008) recently reported preliminary progress on a two stock model for assessing the status of South Pacific humpbacks, considering eastern Australia and Oceania as two demographically separate stocks based on the evidence summarized above. <br />Objectives<br />The main objective of this contract is to complete a population assessment of South Pacific humpback whales.<br />Specifically the contractor and the contractor's collaborators will:<br />1. Gather data from a quality review of DNA profiles (genotypes) and individual identification fluke photographs from humpbacks biopsy sampled and photographed in the Oceania region over a specified period (to be determined in consultation with the COTR).<br />2. Evaluate available abundance estimates for Oceania for the purpose of inclusion in the population model.<br />3. Provide new estimates of abundance from capture-recapture analyses of individual identification photographs (Baker et al. 2006) and from DNA genotyping.<br />4. Explore alternative catch scenarios using the latest corrected IWC catch records and develop catch scenarios to support stock hypotheses agreed in Hobart. Although the currently preferred scenario for Oceania has four breeding stocks, it is not possible to allocate catches independently to each of these proposed stocks. Instead, the contractor will consider a &lsquo;two-stock' scenario in which eastern Australia and Oceania are considered demographically independent <br />5. Incorporate genetic data as a constraint on minimum historical abundance (N) using mtDNA data from Olavarr&iacute;a et al. (2007).<br />6. Design a population model incorporating the parameters described above and determine the range of population growth rates and pre-exploitation abundance that are compatible with the genetic estimate of minimum abundance, most likely catch series and best current abundance estimates.<br />7. Prepare a report to the IWC estimating the recovery levels of humpback whales across Oceania, and describing these estimates across the range of sub-structuring scenarios proposed for the region.<br />The contractor shall first obtain (from collaborators at Oregon State University) a review of DNA genotypes from biopsy samples collected in the South Pacific. This review will include matching of genotypes between years and regions, and a quality review of all genetic loci and samples. The Contractor shall at the same time arrange to complete photo-ID matching and a quality review of photographs collected in the South Pacific region. The photo-id and genetic data shall be used to generate estimates of current abundance for the region, and the contractor will then design a population model to incorporate these abundances within the framework of a model of population history for the region. Population Assessment of South Pacific Humpback Whales is the culmination of years of research by South Pacific Whale Research Consortium, of which Dr. Jennifer Jackson of Marine Research Limited is the member with primary responsibility for such assessment. The Consortium holds all the primary data necessary for a population assessment of Oceania, including multiple regional photo-identification catalogues and genotypic DNA data from biopsy samples collected across region. The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract, period of performance will be twelve months from date of award. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed attention to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513or email at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov.

<DESC>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed-price contract to Total Site Solutions.  Total Site Solution (TSS) is currently under contract with the SEC to provide adequate power for the SEC-Chicago data center room located on the 9th floor at 175 West Jackson. The existing contract includes all facilities construction and building improvements required to support the computer room upgrade for standardization.  The additional work covered by this notice includes installation of a 20kW UPS system with racks and ISX488995-023 hardware in the computer room.  To have continuity of services and to assure schedule integrity, it is essential that TSS install the additional work simultaneously with the original work which allows:  (1) both systems to be installed at the same time; (2) the SEC to save time and administrative cost by using the same building permit; (3) the SEC to utilize the same set of approved building plans to complete the project in its entirety; (4) the work is to be performed in a confined area which would restrict and possibly confuse work performed by multiple contractors.  The period of performance shall be through the completion of the project.  The SEC intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.  This is a Notice of Intent, not a solicitation.  No solicitation will be issued for this sole source requirement and no other information will be provided.

We invite you to the GSA Stimulus Forum to learn the latest information about GSA’s implementation of Recovery Plan projects and initiatives that will take place in our five-state region, which includes Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.

We will begin the Forum with an overview of GSA’s Recovery Plan and provide the location, scope and project descriptions on the 33 projects slated for action across this region.  Since the Recovery Plan is meant to stimulate the economy as quickly as possible, many of these projects will be carried out by current GSA contractors.  However, there will still be a number of prime and subcontracting opportunities available for new contractors.

We will also provide useful information on participating in GSA’s Schedule Program and teaming arrangements.  The Forum will conclude with a networking session with GSA contracting officers and project managers.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds measures necessary to convert Federal facilities into high-performance green buildings.  GSA will renovate and construct Federal buildings, courthouses and land ports of entry.  We are looking for cost effective, high quality and environmentally friendly commercial products and services.

There is no cost to attend the Forum, but we ask you to pre-register by sending an e-mail to R7smallbiz@gsa.gov with the following information.  The parking is FREE.

<a href="mailto:linda.ensminger@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Edgewood</a>
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMAITON (RFI)<BR><BR>Title: NEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL STANDOFF DETECTION (NGCSD) <BR><BR>RFI: The Joint Project Manager for Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPM NBCCA) is conducting a market survey regarding new concepts and technologies to enhance standoff Chemical Biological (CB) detection in support of the Next Generation Chemical Standoff Detection (NGCSD) program (formerly referred to as the Chemical Biological Distributed Early Warning Strategy (CBDEWS). The concept provides for an integrated system of systems to provide multi-layered, real-time, standoff detection and early warning capability for CB threats at fixed sites - including Forward Operating Bases (FOB), remote sites, and check points. <BR><BR>Key technology areas of interest include:<BR><BR>A. New or improved active and passive standoff CB detection technologies and techniques (e.g. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Enhanced Optical/Infrared (EO/IR), Hyperspectral Infrared Imaging, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), etc.)<BR><BR>B. Novel uses of new or improved point detection systems that can be employed in a standoff, projected, or mobile role.<BR><BR>C. Command, Control, Communications and Computer Technologies that integrate and fuse multiple types of sensor data, provide intelligent decision aids in real-time, and slew-to-cue of sensors.<BR><BR>D. Use of currently fielded battlefield sensors in new ways to provide information about CB events (e.g. radar, acoustic, seismic, and surveillance sensors, and unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles, etc.<BR><BR><BR>To this end, the JPM NBCCA is requesting whitepaper submissions to support potential technology integration. After review of industrys submissions, the Government may invite candidates to demonstrate their system (at their cost and on a non-interference basis) during the NGCSD demonstration events to be scheduled during the period from 6-31 July 2009 at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), UT. The Government demonstrations will provide a unique opportunity for participants to demonstrate their technologies and collect data during Government sponsored field demonstration events that would otherwise be difficult and costly to arrange. In exchange, the Government will require participants to provide data collected during the demonstration for use in evaluating the technology or system in a format to be defined in the invitation. <BR><BR>Tests will be conducted at Dugway Proving Ground, UT from approximately 1600-0400 each night. DPG will release approximately 8 events each night for a total of about 120 releases over the 4 week period. Simulants will be TEP, MES, PEG200, BG,and EH. <BR><BR>DPG will provide standard meteorological condition information, such as temperature, RH, wind direction, speed, inversion layer height, etc. DPG will also provide IR camera, scanning FTIR cameras along with point bio referee data.<BR><BR>Participants will be on site for the testing with various systems and sensors. JPM NBC CA will make the final determination on participant locations to ensure all participants have a fair and unobstructed view.<BR><BR><BR>This notice constitutes a request for information only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. There will be no opportunity for questions and answers associated with this RFI.<BR><BR>WHITE PAPER PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION: All responsible United States firms, corporations, organizations, including those within the U.S. Government, private industry, academic institutions, research institutions, non-profit organizations, etc., are encouraged to respond to this RFI by submitting a white paper. <BR><BR>The white paper should summarize the proposed technical concept together with its rationale and objectives, methodology, the expected results, potential operational impacts and its potential integration to the NGCSD.

Describe how the key interfaces could be used or modified to integrate the system with the NGCSD fusion system. Describe a rough order level of effort and timeline required for integration.<BR><BR>3) System Maturity. Identify the maturity of the system (e.g. breadboard, brassboard, prototype, and production), estimated Technology Readiness Level (TRL), and the basis for which these assessments have been made. Provide information on the test environment that the systems were demonstrated in to obtain the TRL assessment. Provide information (if applicable) summarizing previous component or system level testing performed independently or by US Government agencies or other test agencies. <BR><BR>4) Demonstration Plan. Describe the target agents and release event types that would showcase the system/technologies capabilities. Estimate the number of personnel expected to operate the system and equipment footprint required to conduct a demonstration of the system capabilities. <BR><BR>5) Cost and Availability. Provide a rough order estimate of the proposed system cost and the availability of the system for potential procurement by the Government.<BR><BR>The white paper shall be limited to five (5) pages (8.5 inches x 11 inches), of English text.

<DESC>Justification and Approvalfor Other than Full and Open CompetitionforDepartment of Veterans AffairsOffice of Information & Technology (005)Cost Xpert Software Maintenance Renewal1.	Contracting Agency  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)).  The contracting agency for this purchase is:Department of Veterans AffairsOI&T - Albany OIFO113 Holland Avenue(192-2A)Albany, NY  12208	Contracting Activity.  The contracting activity for this purchase is:Department of Veterans AffairsCenter for Acquisition Innovation - Austin1615 Woodward StreetAustin, Texas  787722.	Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)).This Limited Source Justification and Approval sets forth the facts and requests approval for the issuance of a Sole Source Requirement from Cost Xpert Group, Inc., 3131 Camino Del Rio North, San Diego, CA, 92108.   The term of this contract will be for one (1) year at a cost of $3,600.00.  3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs (including estimated value) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)).  The purpose of this contract for the Department of Veterans Affairs, in cooperation with Cost Xpert Group, Inc., is to provide software management support and maintenance to include upgrades, updates, bug-fixes, and support.4.	Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)) - Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.The statutory authority for this justification is FAR 6.302-1 - 6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. (a) Authority. (1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). (2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. 5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above (FAR6.303-2(a)(5)).(Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.)  The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to award a sole-source contract to work in collaboration with the Office of Information & Technology (005).  The contractor offers the following on a proprietary basis:"	E-Mail accessibility"	Software updates"	Software upgrades"	Software patches"	Software maintenance support6.	Description of Efforts To Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From As Many Potential Sources As Practicable, Including Public Notice Requirements (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6)).(A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.)  The Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) is a firm fixed price of $3,600.  After a search on NASA SEWP, GSA Advantage, and the Internet, no other providers were found from which to solicit quotes.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7)).  (A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.)  The maintenance services needed by the VA are available from only one responsible source, Cost Xpert Group, Inc.  Cost Xpert Group, Inc. has proprietary data rights to the Cost Xpert software, since they designed and developed the software.  Using any vendor other than Cost Xpert would result in a significant loss of momentum in the development and enhancement of the software, a fragmentation in the continuity of key design elements, unnecessary and costly meetings, needless time delays, repetition and duplication of effort, and increased cost to the Government.8.	Market Survey (FAR 6.303-2(a)8)).  (A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.)  Market research was conducted on NASA SEWP, GSA Advantage, and the Internet.  No other providers of Cost Xpert maintenance were found.9.	Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)).  (9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.(iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.)  None10.	List of Sources, If Any, That Expressed A Written Interest In The Acquisition (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10)).  (A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.) Cision11.	Actions, If Any, That Are Being Taken to Remove and Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisitions for The Supplies or Services Required (FAR 6.303-2(a)(11)).  (A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.)The Department of Veterans Affairs anticipates limited competition amongst vendors, if deemed appropriate.12.

<DESC>Synopsis: 
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 561410, is to notify contractors that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking competition of this requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procures.

Under the simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.  This synopsis is designated for full and open competition for a Labor hour purchase order.  Prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation.  Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

This combined synopsis solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ).  The FDA intends to award a purchase order for the expansion and validation of invitro assays for detection of events predictive of leukemogenic potential of retroviral vector from pre-clinical or clinical samples.  The Statement of Work is as follows:

Objective:  Define the optimal parameters and target cell for an in vitro assay method that is reproducible, sensitive, and quantifiable in detection of retroviral vector-mediated cell transformation.


BACKGROUND:

Identified Public Health Gap & Critical Path Need:  Children in a gene therapy clinical protocol for X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (X-SCID) have developed leukemia as a result of insertion and subsequent activation of known human oncogenes by the retroviral vector used to treat their disease.  This tragic outcome has led many investigators in the gene therapy field to develop novel retroviral vectors with the expectation that they may provide the therapeutic benefit that the gammaretroviral vector used in France provided to the children with X-SCID but with a reduced risk of tumorigenesis.  In an effort to develop and validate an animal model that can be used to assess the relative tumorigenic risks associated with new vectors, FDA and academic investigators will assess various vectors that are under development.  The animal model that we are using was initially developed by Dr. Christopher Baum (co-affiliated with the Hannover Medical School in Germany as well as Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center).  While the animal model that will be used in the study can reproducibly detect retroviral vector-mediated tumorigenic events, it is time-consuming (6-14 months before tumorigenic events are detected), expensive, and requires use of animals.  In an effort to develop a method that would be faster, higher throughput, less expensive, and not require animals, Dr. Baum has shown that ex vivo transduction of primary cultures of murine hematopoietic stem cells can be used to detect immortalization events when subject to prolonged in vitro culture, depending on the vector structure.  We propose that the in vitro assay would not substitute for an in vivo tumorigenicity assay, but may be suitable as an initial screen of new vector types, and if the new vector was negative or had a low rate in the in vitro assay, it would then be reasonable to proceed with the more rigorous and most relevant in vivo assay to look for tumorigenicity in the mouse model.  However, prior to instituting this type of approach, the in vitro method needs to be further studied and the assay needs to be optimized and developed in order to demonstrate its reproducibility, sensitivity, and ability to be sufficiently quantitative for comparison of different vector types that may transform primary cells by different mechanisms.  The goal would be to complement the ongoing study by performing the immortalization assay on the same sets of transduced cells that are going into the mice, and in this way, one could obtain side-by-side comparisons of the relative sensitivity of each assay, as well as obtain data to define the reproducibility and reliability of the in vitro method.  If the assay proves to be suitable, then future sponsors would have a relatively inexpensive and rapid (weeks vs. months-year) assay method to perform an initial screen of novel vector constructions for assessment of relative risk. The additional advantage of using the in vitro assay for initial screens is the reduction in the use of animals for tumorigenicity testing.  Availability of an in vitro method to assess the tumorigenic likelihood of new retroviral vectors in hematopoietic cells may ultimately translate into a reduced risk to clinical trial participants, along with economic savings to the sponsors developing these novel products, and a reduction in the number of animals used for safety testing.


Scope of Work:

The methodological approach:

Indentify the target cell type, in three (3) steps.

1) Identify the primary hematopoietic cell source that provides a reliable and sensitive measure of transformation due to vector-mediated insertional mutagenesis. Different hematopoietic cell lineages will be analyzed for their relative sensitivity to transformation after vector transduction in an established replating assay.  

2) Using different retroviral vectors varying in the types of regulatory elements included in backbone, the mechanism of transformation as a function of vector backbone will be determined. Analysis of frequency of transformation events in the optimized assay and mapping of genomic integration sites will be used to elucidate the mechanism associated with different regulatory elements. The results will be used to rationally design various types of integrating vectors that can circumvent the mechanisms indentified as primary drivers of transformation events. 

3) Clonal lines (murine or human) carrying specific oncogenes will be established and tested for reversion of transformation due to down-regulated expression of the oncogene using inducible promoters, thus making the transformation phenotype conditional. These cells will be examined for resistance to oncogene down-regulation as a result of insertional mutagenesis – perhaps leading to an unrestricted, highly reproducible cell line for the transformation assay.

<DESC>Humidity / Temperature stability chamber specs

Create four climate controlled chambers (humidity and temperature control for stability) with interior dimensions of at least 24x24x24 inches, with shelving for holding wood samples to condition to specific moisture content.  The chambers should all run off 208 V 1 phase 60 Hz power, with a deionized water inlet and drain connections for humidity creation and control.  

The units should be of rugged construction to withstand hot and cold conditions with both high and low humidity interior conditions as further specified below.  The interior must be stainless steel to resist corrosion and all doors, ports, and windows must be well sealed and insulated to maintain interior conditions and provide a long service life.

All units should use highly accurate temperature and humidity sensors and provide sufficient air flow along with a robust control system capable of holding temperature set point within 1 degree C and humidity set point to 3 % RH inside the chamber at all times after initial stabilization.  The control system on all units should make it simple to enter desired RH and temperature control set points and provide user feedback.  Two of the units should be RS232 enabled to allow remote control and monitoring of interior conditions with a computer.

The four units have different temperature and humidity requirements.
Two should be able to go down to -17 C and up over 120 C.  The other two can go from 4 C to 90 C.  All chambers should be able to go from 20 % RH to 93% RH (understanding a 4 degree C dew point limitation may make part of this range unavailable without a dryer).  Two of the chambers should contain a drying unit which allows RH below ambient conditions down to at least 10 % RH under all temperature conditions.  One dryer should be installed on one of the units which can go over 100 C for temperature, and this unit should have a small port and plug available on the top of the unit for access to the chamber while it is running.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

We intend to purchase a torque rheometer system.  The system will have the same or equivalent salient qualities as those associated with the rheometer system built by:

C.W. Brabender Instruments, Inc,
50 E. Wesley Street
S. Hackensack, NJ 07606

There are three essential components to the torque rheometer system to meet our needs:
1) Torque rheometer/drive unit with data acquisition system (Intelli-Torque Plasti-Corder®)
2) Batch mixer attachment (Prep-Mixer® Mixer/Measuring Head)
3) Extruder attachment

Part numbers are in parentheses. 

Torque rheometer/drive unit with data acquisition system (Intelli-Torque Plasti-Corder®)

The heart of the unit is the combination drive/torque rheometer (01-45-000). This unit drives and controls the extruder screw (when extruder is attached) or mixer blades (when batch mixer is attached) and measures the torque required to rotate the screw/mixer blades. Additionally, the unit measures and controls zone temperatures of the attachments and measures other processing parameters (e.g., melt pressure). This information is collected and analyzed by the computer data acquisition system which consists of:
1)	Dell Optiplex 745 computer system (01-41-000)
2)	Color inkjet printer (01-40-000)
3)	MixCorr software(626)
4)	Mobile computer car (08-49-000)
5)	Surge protection strip (01-33-030)

Batch mixer attachment (Prep-Mixer® Mixer/Measuring Head)
The batch mixer is an electrically heated mixing chamber (02-23-000) with a set of non-intermeshing, counter-rotating roller blades (02-22-026) to melt and blend polymers, disperse fillers and reinforcements, and blend various additives (e.g., lubricants, crosslinking agents, fungicides, coupling agents, etc). Measurement of parameters such as torque and temperature can be used to continuously monitor processes such as melting, dispersion, crosslinking, and lubrication of polymers and their blends/composites using standard methods (e.g., ASTM D3795). A loading chute (02-22-026) and cleaning kit (02-22-032) are also included.


 
Extruder attachment
The single screw extruder attachment is used to continuously process polymer/polymer composite materials, produce test specimens, examine extrudate quality, and can potentially be used to generate viscosity curves by capillary extrusion rheometry according to standard methods (e.g., ASTM D5422). The extruder attachment consists of:
1)	Electrically heated, air-cooled extruder barrel with thermocouples, overload coupling, and rupture plug (05-09-000)
2)	¾” metering screw with a 25:1 length-to-diameter ratio and 3:1 compression ratio (05-00-047)
3)	Combination temperature and pressure transducer with adapter (01-45-060)
4)	Feed hopper (05-00-299)
5)	Horizontal rod die assembly with heater and thermocouple (05-62-000)
6)	Interchangeable rod die nozzles:
a.	1/8” inner diameter (05-00-088)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, TIRNO-09-Q-SPA74, provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-31 are incorporated into this RFQ.  This procurement is a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran- Owned companies.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423430. The small business size standard is $100 million. 

See the attached Government Equipment List (GEL) for the requirement specifications.  All pricing shall be submitted on the attached GEL.  Pricing submitted in any other format will not be accepted.  See the attached Statement of Work (SOW) for a description of the required services.

The period of performance for all maintenance and services will be 12 months from the date of award.  Delivery of all hardware and software shall occur 30 days from the date of award.

The shipping instructions are as follows:

CLINs 0001-0009 should be shipped to:
Randy Knight, 304-264-7034, IRS, Martinsburg Computing Center, 250 Mural Road, Kearneysville, WV 25430

CLINs 0010-0015 should be shipped to:
Bill McMullin, 901-546-3474, Tennessee Computing Center, 5333 Getwell Road, Memphis, TN 38118

The IRS is seeking competitive RFQs for the following brand name requirement, “EMC Hardware, Software, Support Services and Maintenance."   The rationale supporting this brand name requirement is that EMC is the only brand that can satisfy the IRS’ Modernized e-File (MeF) project requirement.  MeF is a large modernization effort that provides electronic filing and payment options for businesses that include corporations, exempt organizations, partnerships and filers of excise tax returns.

The MeF project currently utilizes an EMC DMX2000 storage array in both production and Disaster Recovery (DR) sites.  In conjunction with custom Unix scripting and Business Continuance Volumes (BCVs), Symmetrix Remote Data Facility (SRDF) – Data Mobility (DM) has been implemented to perform periodic data replications in a sort of “batch” mode.  This strategy has worked well to meet or exceed the previous Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 24 hours and 36 hours respectively of this Critical project.  In anticipation of increased usage of the MeF application, however, the RPO and RTO have been adjusted for Release 6 to be 1 hour and 90 minutes respectively.  In order to meet or exceed these elevated requirements, a new strategy has been selected which will employ SRDF/A (Asynchronous) to perform federated, near real-time, database-consistent data replications of the MeF database and application filesystem.

Therefore, the IRS has a requirement for the software and hardware upgrade of the existing Tier 2 EMC storage arrays for MeF production and DR environments at the computing centers located in Martinsburg (Kearneysville), WV (ECC-MTB) and Memphis, TN (ECC-MEM).  This will involve SAN data storage equipment including hardware and software, installation, configuration and professional services for implementation, upgrade, migration and transfer of knowledge to support personnel.

This is an RFQ and brand name justification to procure EMC Hardware, Software, Support Services and Maintenance.  The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of other brand names but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent.  All manufacturers that can perform the equivalent function/services should submit their technical qualifications and literature to the following email address: Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov.  

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-31 are applicable to this procurement: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors – Commercial Items, and FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition. Offerors shall include a fully executed copy of FAR provisions at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with their offer. FAR Clauses 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Per 12.603(b) the SF 1449 is not used. FAR clause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans and 52.232-33, Payment of Electronic Funds Transfer – Central Contractor Registration. 

All responsible sources that can provide the above requirements and deliver all products shall submit written quotations no later than 10:00am EST on June 5, 2009. The government intends to award a firm fixed price order. The Vendor shall be selected based on the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  All quotes must include price(s); Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted. All questions must be submitted by email to Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov no later than 10:00am EST on June 5, 2009.

To be considered responsive and technically acceptable, vendors must submit proposals that are structured in accordance with the instructions set forth in this solicitation and fully address the entire requirement for each site.  You will be considered non-responsive and technically unacceptable if your quote does not fully address the entire requirement.  This will also render your pricing unacceptable.

<DESC><p>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NT910000912888DT.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.</p>
<p>(IV) This procurement is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 334290. The small business size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s):</p>
<p>A G.1050 Internet Protocol (IP) Network Impairment Emulator. It will be used to add ITU-T Recommendation G.1050 impairments to IP audio and video streams as part of on-going National and International testing efforts.</p>
<p><br />(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />The Video Quality Research Project at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (NTIA/ITS) needs to procure an Internet Protocol (IP) Network Impairment Emulator. This IP emulator will be used to add impairments to IP audio and video streams (e.g., dropped packets, jitter, packet reorder) as part of on-going National and International testing efforts. NTIA/ITS is an active member in the International Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG) and as such, tests the performance of video systems over IP (e.g., Multimedia, HDTV, IPTV). Therefore, the IP emulator must implement the recently approved ITU-T Recommendation G.1050 (entitled "Network model for evaluating multimedia transmission performance over Internet Protocol") that accurately models these impairments. The IP emulator must have a minimum of two 1-Gigabit Ethernet interfaces to be compatible with our existing laboratory equipment (e.g., switches, codecs, set-top boxes) so it can be inserted between the device that is streaming the video (e.g., codec) and the device that is receiving the video (e.g., set-top box). The IP emulator should be expandable to at least four 1-Gigabit interfaces. The IP emulator must be able to simultaneously impair network traffic in both directions. Hardware based emulators are preferable to software based emulators for two reasons:<br />1. Hardware based emulators are faster than software based emulators and can run at full or nearly full line rates (i.e., the emulator can keep up with all the packets even when sent at Gigabit speeds). The aggregate throughput of a IP emulator in packets per second is an important specification and this may depend upon packet size. For voice, the typical packet size is 64 bytes and thus to operate at 1.0 Gigabit/sec, the IP emulator must be able to process about (1,000,000,000)/(64*8) = 1.9 million packets per second. For video, the typical packet size is 1500 bytes and the packet rate is much less (about 83,000 packets per second). Our initial applications of the IP emulator involve a mix of audio and video that could require processing up to 100,000 packets per second.<br />2. Hardware based emulators can more accurately simulate time varying changes in network impairments such as those given in ITU-T Recommendation G.1050 (i.e., G.1050 impairments are time varying and can change every 1 ms, or 0.001 seconds).<br />Another important specification is the maximum delay that can be emulated and this is a function of both how many packets per second are being transmitted through the device and how much memory the device contains. For our applications, it is required that the IP emulator be able to simulate at least 5 seconds of delay for a throughput of 20,000 packets per second (1500 byte packets).<br />The number of bi-directional simulation links (called profiles, virtual interfaces, or clients by the various vendors) specifies how to impair traffic from/to one IP address to another and is another relevant specification. Currently our work requires only one bi-directional simulation link but having additional links would allow for greater flexibility and expandability in the future (please specify the maximum number of bi-directional simulation links that are available and their associated costs).<br />Two other expansion capabilities are desired for future use but these are not included in the present quote (please give the cost for these expansion capabilities as separate line items). One is the ability to selectively impair I, B, and P packets in an MPEG-2 transport stream and the other is the ability to capture to a file and accurately replay network streams with impairments. Finally, warranty and support (1 year required), and ease of use are considerations. The IP emulator should have an easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI) for setting up bi-directional simulation links and running tests.</p>

<p>ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT</p>
<p>ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT-Metals<br />(a) "Producer Price Index" (PPI), as used in this clause, means the originally released index, not seasonally adjusted, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor (Labor) at website: http://www.bls.gov/ppi/home.htm#data, for Series ID WPU1012, Group (10) Metals and metal products.<br />(b) Upward adjustments only occur once and must be requested by the contractor at least 30 calendar days prior to the end of the current contract period.</p>
<p>Downward adjustments may take place any number of times during the contract period in which they occur. In any option period, the contract price may be adjusted upward or downward a maximum of 10 percent.<br />(1) For the first option period, any price adjustment for the series ID shall be based upon the percentage change in the PPI released the month prior to award in negotiation (the base index) and the PPI released in the third month before completion of the initial (base) contract period stated at award (the updated index). This initial (base) contract period may be less than 12 months. The formula for determining the Adjusted Contract Price (ACP) applicable to orders placed/delivered during the first option period is-<br />Adjusted Contract Price = Updated Index<br />________________ x Award Price<br />Base Index<br />(2) For any subsequent option period, the price adjustment shall be the percentage change between the previously updated index (the new base index) and the PPI released 12 months later (the most recent updated index). This percentage shall be applied to the Current Contract Price (CCP). The formula for determining the ACP applicable to orders placed/delivered during the subsequent option period(s) is-<br />Adjusted Contract Price = Most Recent Updated Index<br />_________________________ x Award Price x CCP<br />New Base Index</p>
<p>(c) If the PPI is not available for the month of the base index or the updated index, the month with the most recently published PPI prior to the month determining the base index or updated index shall be used.<br />(d) If a product code is discontinued, the Government and the Contractor will mutually agree to substitute a similar series ID. If Labor designates an index with a new title and/or code number as continuous with the product code specified above, the new index shall be used.<br />(e) Unless the Contractor's written request for a price adjustment resulting from the application of the formulas in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this clause is received by the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days of the date of the Government's preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise the option is issued, the Contractor shall have waived its right to an upward price adjustment for that option period. Therefore, the Contracting Officer in its written notice shall exercise the option at the current contract price (CCP) or at a reduced price when appropriate using the formulas in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this clause.<br />(f) The following material shall be submitted with the request for a price increase/decrease:<br />(1) A copy of the PPI showing the percentage change upon which the adjustment is to be based;<br />(2) Documentation supporting the calculations of the appropriate formula noted above;<br />(3) Documentation supporting the reasonableness of the price adjustment.<br />(g) The Government reserves the right to exercise one of the following options:<br />(1) Accept the contractor's price adjustment as requested when all conditions of this provision are satisfied; <br />(2) Negotiate more favorable unit price(s) when the adjustment is not supported; or<br />(3) Not exercise the option.<br />(h) Price adjustments shall be effected by execution of a contract modification by the Government indicating the most recent updated index and percent of change and shall apply to delivery orders placed on or after the first day of the option period.<br />(i) No upward price adjustment will be made unless the percentage change in the PPI is at least 10 percent.</p>
<p>All responsible, responsive sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency.</p>

(b)	Cost proposal
(c)	Past performance on at least 3 similar projects


SECTION 14.	EVALUATION FACTORS

14.1	The OIG’s source evaluation will be based on best-value principles. Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose proposal provides the greatest overall value to the government, price and other factors considered. This best-value determination will be accomplished by comparing the value of the differences in the technical factors for competing offers, based on their strengths, weaknesses, and risks, with differences in their price to the Government. In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical capabilities than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. 

14.2	Evaluation of all offers will be made in accordance with the criteria outlined in this section. The proposals will be evaluated against the following four (4) factors:

Factor 1 Experience
Factor 2 Technical Approach 
Factor 3 Past Performance
Factor 4 Price

14.3	Factors 1 through 3 are referred to as the Technical Factors. Factor 4 is a Price Factor that will be evaluated separately and applied in the determination of best value. The rated technical evaluation criteria are more important than price. As relative technical advantages and disadvantages become less distinct, differences in price between proposals are of increased importance in determining the most advantageous proposal. Conversely, as differences in price become less distinct, differences in relative technical advantages and disadvantages between proposals are of increased importance to the determination.

14.4	 The technical evaluation will be attained through a determination and an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each proposal. Technical risks will be included in the final evaluation of each factor and will not be evaluated as a separate factor. In the assessment of technical risk, the Government evaluators will consider all available information.

(a)	Experience.  At least 5 years of recent experience demonstrating the ability to redesign, using the latest features in web development technologies, an existing web site in order to organizationally, graphically, and visually enhance user experience. 
(b)	Technical Proposal.  Technical proposal contains a plan of action and timeframes demonstrating the ability to design and implement a new web site that meets the requirements of this SOW as well as those identified during the project planning and initiation.  The contractor demonstrates the ability to anticipate any problems that could surface with the work and the ability to resolve them appropriately, using methodologies that exhibit technical and operational understanding of the requirements stated in this solicitation.
(c)	Past Performance.  List of references demonstrating superior web site design and development services.  At a minimum, the following information should be provided: contract/project name; description of the project; period of performance; web site URL if publicly accessible; screen prints of significant pages or features; customer point of contact with telephone number.

14.5	The contractor must provide a detailed description of the support options to be provided during and after the implementation of the proposed site. Support would include software support, updates, and any ongoing costs. The OIG expects to maintain and update content of the site using OIG staff.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSTS07-09-R-00138 which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).    This requirement will be an unrestricted acquisition.  The proposed contract will be for one year.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699.  Services anticipated range service to begin no later than August 1, 2009.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firing range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  The range facility must be indoors; located in close proximity to a major trauma facility and within an hour drive to Romulus, Michigan.

The proposed range must meet various standards to qualify. The range must be an indoor facility closed to the public or shall provide privacy from public view during the corresponding hours.

The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms training firing points by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions). The range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster. The range rules cannot disallow students from multiple and rapid-fire drills.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, (i.e. tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive). DHS employees are not authorized to sign a Hold Harmless Clause/Agreement. The range must possess a storage area dedicated to FAMS firearms instructors and agents. The indoor range must possess a ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards. The estimated days of range usage are 24 days per quarter; at least seven (7) hours per day.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                Commandant (G-A)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<CONTACT>Michelle K Esquivel, Contract Negotiator, Phone 8017778651, Email michelle.esquivel@us.af.mil
<DESC><p>In accordance with the partnering agreement between the Air Force and Lockheed Martin, Lockheed will provide the F-22 maintenance stands. OSHA has required the Air Force to comply with fall protection regulations by Oct 2009. The maintenance stands have only been built by Lockheed and its subcontractors. Lockheed cannot provide the F-22 maintenance stands in the timeframe required. Therefore, two small business contractors previously used by Lockheed to manufacturer stands were identified to have current access to Lockheed's proprietary data and to the classified aircraft. These two small businesses can provide the stands within the timeframe required allowing the Air Force to meet the OSHA schedule and safety requirements.
<p>For the reasons stated above, the government determined to post this on FedBizOpps as a limited sources solicitation. However if additional small business contractors submit a proposal the information will be accepted, considered, and listed in the contract file.</p>
<p>According to the solicitation two factors will be used to evaluate proposals. The first factor is price and the second is technical acceptability. These factors will be used in determining the best value to the government.</p>

An Offeror may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

Where can I obtain the FEMA fuel tank spec to ensure our FEMA specs are up to date?
 
Answer:  The generator shall be equipped with a UL142 double-walled sub-base and vented, integrated fuel tank of sufficient capacity as to hold a 12hr supply of fuel for the generator to which it is affixed.  This is different that the 24hr specification required in the continental US.  The tank must include two 4x10 .250 fork pockets spaced based on the generators center of gravity at not more than 77 inches apart.  Furthermore, the generator shall also be equipped with all lines and fittings necessary to properly connect the generator to the fuel tank, as well as hydraulic quick-disconnect couplers installed on both fuel supply and return lines to facilitate the use of external fuel caddies during maintenance operations.  A photo of a similar machine already on-hand is attached.
Q.  Are the generators both standbys or portable?
Answer: The word both in the question implies the request is for two generators; the request is for only a single machine.  The single generator being requested is a portable MQ Power brand 400kva generator with the specification outlined in the request.
Q.  Do they need transfer switches?
Answer: No
Q.  How much amperage feed into the building?
Answer: The amperage requirements are the amperage capabilities of the requested brand and model generator.  This question presumes the machine is being purchased for a specific building; it is not.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>Modification #001</p>
<p>Responses to questions submitted on 5/26/09.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is there a rail site near the plant so shipments can be delivered by rail?</p>
<p>Yes, there is a&nbsp;Union Pacific rail line within 100 yards of the plant.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;there is storage at the Nogales plant for less than 15,000 gallons.&nbsp; The plant will take deliveries in the range of 6,500 to 12,000 gallons at a time.&nbsp; Any rail car storage issue will be&nbsp;between vendor and Union Pacific.&nbsp; Vendor would still be required to unload and deliver product via truck.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Are you currently purchasing carbon?</p>
<p>IBWC&nbsp;is not purchasing glycerin at this time.&nbsp; It is being purchased by the construction manager as part of the Nogales plant start agreement.&nbsp; Once the facility is under IBWC's&nbsp;control, the agency&nbsp;will be required to provide the glycerin with&nbsp;agency&nbsp;funds.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Is this a new requirement?</p>
<p>Yes, this is&nbsp;a new requirement for the new Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant to be completed on or about 6/23/09.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modification #002</p>
<p>Responses to questions submitted on 5/27/09.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reference to question #2 above, please advise from whom the plant manager is purchasing material, price per gl paid and FOB terms.</p>
<p>Since this is currently not&nbsp;our contract to purchase product, we are unable to provide information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Do you use any activated carbon in your wastewater treatment process? I was reading through the bid document and only saw glycerin and corn syrup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;No we do not use activated carbon. We had looked at it as a possible source but the expense was too great. Also we are limited by the equipment we have to use&nbsp;glycerin or corn syrup. Any other carbon source would require us to invest quite substantially in&nbsp;infrastructure to support it (this rules out methanol, ethanol etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Modification #003</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Would you be able to provide specifications on glycerin?</p>
<p>The Materials Safety Data Sheet is attached.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Does the crude glycerin need to be packaged in a tote or does it need to be in drums?</p>
<p>The glycerin needs to be delivered by tanker, 5,000 gallons at a time.</p>

<p>ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT-Metals<br />(a) "Producer Price Index" (PPI), as used in this clause, means the originally released index, not seasonally adjusted, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor (Labor) at website: http://www.bls.gov/ppi/home.htm#data, for Series ID WPU1012, Group (10) Metals and metal products.<br />(b) Upward adjustments only occur once and must be requested by the contractor at least 30 calendar days prior to the end of the current contract period.</p>
<p>Downward adjustments may take place any number of times during the contract period in which they occur. In any option period, the contract price may be adjusted upward or downward a maximum of 10 percent.<br />(1) For the first option period, any price adjustment for the series ID shall be based upon the percentage change in the PPI released the month prior to award in negotiation (the base index) and the PPI released in the third month before completion of the initial (base) contract period stated at award (the updated index). This initial (base) contract period may be less than 12 months. The formula for determining the Adjusted Contract Price (ACP) applicable to orders placed/delivered during the first option period is-<br />Adjusted Contract Price = Updated Index<br />________________ x Award Price<br />Base Index<br />(2) For any subsequent option period, the price adjustment shall be the percentage change between the previously updated index (the new base index) and the PPI released 12 months later (the most recent updated index). This percentage shall be applied to the Current Contract Price (CCP). The formula for determining the ACP applicable to orders placed/delivered during the subsequent option period(s) is-<br />Adjusted Contract Price = Most Recent Updated Index<br />_________________________ x Award Price x CCP<br />New Base Index</p>
<p>(c) If the PPI is not available for the month of the base index or the updated index, the month with the most recently published PPI prior to the month determining the base index or updated index shall be used.<br />(d) If a product code is discontinued, the Government and the Contractor will mutually agree to substitute a similar series ID. If Labor designates an index with a new title and/or code number as continuous with the product code specified above, the new index shall be used.<br />(e) Unless the Contractor's written request for a price adjustment resulting from the application of the formulas in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this clause is received by the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days of the date of the Government's preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise the option is issued, the Contractor shall have waived its right to an upward price adjustment for that option period. Therefore, the Contracting Officer in its written notice shall exercise the option at the current contract price (CCP) or at a reduced price when appropriate using the formulas in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this clause.<br />(f) The following material shall be submitted with the request for a price increase/decrease:<br />(1) A copy of the PPI showing the percentage change upon which the adjustment is to be based;<br />(2) Documentation supporting the calculations of the appropriate formula noted above;<br />(3) Documentation supporting the reasonableness of the price adjustment.<br />(g) The Government reserves the right to exercise one of the following options:<br />(1) Accept the contractor's price adjustment as requested when all conditions of this provision are satisfied; <br />(2) Negotiate more favorable unit price(s) when the adjustment is not supported; or<br />(3) Not exercise the option.<br />(h) Price adjustments shall be effected by execution of a contract modification by the Government indicating the most recent updated index and percent of change and shall apply to delivery orders placed on or after the first day of the option period.<br />(i) No upward price adjustment will be made unless the percentage change in the PPI is at least 10 percent.</p>
<p>All responsible, responsive sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency.</p>

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>Air Education and Training Command Specialized Contracting Squadron Strategic Sourcing Flight (AETC CONS/LGCS), Randolph AFB, TX is conducting an acquisition for Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) services at 12 AETC Bases and Fort Sam Houston (FSH). This pre-solicitation synopsis is being issued for non-personal services. Note: The description contained within this synopsis is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all inclusive. AETC intends to combine refuse and recycling services incorporating a Resource Management (RM) approach and consolidate 12 AETC bases plus Ft Sam Houston (FSH) through strategic sourcing. The RM approach is a dual vectored approach aimed at analyzing waste streams currently generated by installations. One avenue seeks out methods and innovation to grossly increase diversion. A second analysis determines the most cost effective commodities to process at the specified installation based on existing Government Furnished Equipment/Property (GFE/GFP) and commodity market strengths. Both streams are baselined to determine actual diversion metrics. Diversion of solid waste is focused upon obtaining the new diversion goals while maximizing the amount of revenue generating commodities being diverted to the recycling operations. Innovative methods are recommended and implemented throughout the process to increase solid waste separation and disposal, as well as innovative use of refuse/recycling container placement and scheduling/routing to minimize non-value added tasks in the process as well as increasing the installation's participation in the program. Successful offerors will be responsible for all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, supervision and other items and services necessary to perform refuse and recycling services through a RM approach. The RM approach can be utilized within both the refuse and recycling functions separately. The contractor shall perform to the standards in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) to include all applicable local, state and federal regulations. We anticipate a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) to up to five (5) awardees will result from the solicitation. We foresee the basic MATOC to be for a one (1) year base period and will include 7 one-year option periods. Each base will receive a separate task order and shall be for a one (1) year base period and will include 4 one-year option periods. We intend to issue task orders for Goodfellow, Sheppard and Keesler upon award of the MATOCs. We anticipate three (3) additional task order competitions over the next three years to phase in the additional 10 bases. There will be a 30-day mobilization period for Goodfellow, Sheppard and Keesler AFB's scheduled to begin in Nov 09. A 30-day mobilization period will be utilized prior to implementing each additional task order. We anticipate posting the Request for Proposal on or about 26 Jun 09 and proposals are anticipated to be due 30 days later on or about 26 July 09.

This requirement will be conducted utilizing the Small Business 8(a) competitive procedures and will be evaluated using a Performance Price Trade-off approach per Informational Guidance (IG) 5315.101-1.

<DESC><p>DME MAC Re-competes: Jurisdictions A, B, and D Questions for Industry Background In 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA), Public Law 108-173. This Act amended Title XVIII of the Social Security Act by establishing the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) contracting authority (section 911 of the MMA). The MMA required that all Medicare claims processing and related functions performed by the previous fiscal intermediaries and carriers under the Medicare fee-for-service program be competed and awarded to the new MACs through use of federal procurement procedures. In 2006, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded three Durable Medical Equipment (DME) MAC contracts to administer Medicare claims for DME benefits in jurisdictions A, B, and D (see CMS&rsquo; website at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicareContractingReform/ for more detail regarding the DME MAC jurisdictions). Under the MMA, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must re-compete MAC contracts at least every five (5) years. Therefore, CMS intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the contracts for DME MAC jurisdictions A, B, and D by the end of calendar year 2009. Model Technical Proposal Instructions The CMS is considering modifications to its Technical Proposal instructions for the DME MAC RFP. Rather than requiring offerors to submit full written, Technical Proposals or make traditional in-person oral presentations, CMS is considering requiring offerors to submit the majority of their Technical Proposals in a video/multimedia presentation (NOTE: The CMS may also use this approach in future MAC procurements, including those for Medicare Part A and B claims processing services). The proposed instructions for this video/multimedia presentation are listed below. &bull; Videos/multimedia presentations shall be submitted on a single 8.54 GB (single-sided double-layer) +R DVD. &bull; The DVD shall contain the video/multimedia presentation of the offeror&rsquo;s Technical Proposal for those criteria identified in section L (For the purposes of this RFI, refer to the sample criteria on page 2). &bull; The video/multimedia presentation submitted by offerors shall be fully compliant with the standards found in section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended in 1998. Specifically: &sect; 1194.24 Video and multimedia products. (c) All training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agency's mission, regardless of format, that contain speech or other audio information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be open or closed captioned. (d) All training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agency's mission, regardless of format, that contain visual information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be audio described. (e) Display or presentation of alternate text presentation or audio descriptions shall be user-selectable unless permanent. &bull; The video/multimedia presentation of the Technical Proposal shall not exceed 15 minutes per sub-chapter. &bull; The video/multimedia presentation shall be organized into chapters and sub-chapters and in the same format and order as the technical evaluation criteria. These chapters and sub-chapters must be accessible via a main DVD menu. An example (from past MAC procurements) of evaluation criteria that would be presented on the DVD and proposed organization could be: Chapter 1. Technical Understanding Sub-Chapter 1. Program Management Sub-Chapter 2. Claims Processing Sub-Chapter 3. Provider Customer Service Program Sub-Chapter 4. Appeals Sub-Chapter 5. Medical Review Chapter 2. Implementation Sub-Chapter 1. Implementation Approach Sub-Chapter 2. Implementation Risk Management Plan &bull; At the end of each sub-chapter, the offeror shall restate all technical innovations proposed for that section of the technical proposal. &bull; The offeror shall submit the following supplemental files on the DVD: &#61485; Slide presentations in MS PowerPoint 2003 format (e.g., charts, graphs, and flowcharts). &#61485; Transcripts of spoken dialogue. No other supplemental files shall be included on the DVD. Any information submitted in supplemental files that was not discussed during the presentation may not be considered in evaluating an offeor&rsquo;s Technical Proposal. &bull; Only Key Personnel shall present the offeror&rsquo;s Technical Proposal in the DVD presentation. Key Personnel shall present on those criteria that represent their area of oversight and/or expertise. For example, the Claims Processing Manager would be required to present on a claims processing factor/sub-factor. In addition to this video/multi-media presentation, CMS intends to continue to request certain elements of the Technical Proposal in writing using Microsoft Word 2003 format. Examples (from past MAC procurements) of elements that would be requested in writing could include: &bull; Past Performance &bull; Staffing Plan, &bull; Key Personnel, &bull; Implementation Personnel, and &bull; Corporate Experience. Questions for Industry Based upon past procurement experience and/or industry best practices, please provide your comments on these model RFP instructions for CMS&rsquo; consideration, including comments on topics such as: 1. How much time would you need to prepare your Technical Proposal in accordance with the instructions identified above? 2. Is the time allotted (15 minutes per sub-chapter) a reasonable amount of time for a presentation? Would you prefer an overall limit to the presentation (e.g., two hours)? 3. What are your overall questions/concerns with CMS&rsquo; proposed approach to use a video/multimedia presentation for offerors&rsquo; Technical Proposals? Would you prefer the use of traditional in-person oral presentations? 4. In addition to the model instructions provided above, are there additional instructions and/or parameters that CMS needs to address to ensure that offerors understand what they need to provide in their submission and to ensure that CMS gets the information it needs to make informed judgments regarding offerors&rsquo; proposed technical approaches? 5. Is there another media source (other than DVD) that CMS should consider for the video/multimedia presentation? 6. Do you recommend a different format/structure for the video/multimedia presentation (other than what is described in the model Technical Proposal instructions)? Are there additional elements of a technical proposal that CMS has historically requested in a written proposal that you feel could be presented in the video/multi-media presentation? 7. What is an appropriate page limits for slides used in your presentation? Please provide your response to this Request for Information (RFI) at the email address (MAC_PROCUREMENT@cms.hhs.gov) no later than close of business Tuesday, March 24, 2009. Responses should be submitted as an email attachment in Microsoft Word 2003 format. For purposes of this RFI, the term &ldquo;vendor&rdquo; refers to those members of industry providing responses to this RFI. The vendor should identify any proprietary information in their RFI responses. Proprietary materials will neither be distributed to nor discussed with any other vendor. CMS will use the information submitted in response to this RFI at its discretion and will not provide comments to any vendor&rsquo;s submission. However, responses to the RFI submitted may be reflected in the final solicitation. CMS reserves the right to contact any vendor that responds to this RFI for the sole purpose of enhancing CMS&rsquo; understanding of your RFI submission. This notice is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this RFI and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with any RFI submissions.</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment 01:&nbsp; The purpose of this amendment is to revise cost sharing information, as highlighted in yellow in the BAA document.&nbsp; See the conform BAA document attached with highlighted changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Original Synopsis below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative fundamental research proposals in the area of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and arrays enabled by emerging and maturing nano/micro technologies. The contemplated program on Nanoelectromechanical /Microelectromechanical Science &amp; Technology Fundamentals (N/MEMS S&amp;T Fundamentals) is seeking research by means of highly interactive, multi-performer (university/nonprofit/industry/other) focus centers dedicated to advancing a number of core technologies considered essential to the continuing advancement of NEMS and MEMS technology and its transition into applications important to the Department of Defense (DoD). Proposed research to be conducted by university and industrial research partners, with possible additional participation by Government laboratories (to the extent such Government organizations can prove their eligibility), should be focused on cross-cutting fundamental issues having pervasive impact to the technical community and capable of enabling revolutionary advances in micro/nano technology science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. <br />DARPA intends to fund innovative research efforts for periods of up to three years in the form of scientific focus centers involving multiple and highly interactive university, nonprofit, industry, and Government laboratory teams. Awards will be made only to teams led by an academic institution or a non-profit organization. A significant level of cost-sharing by industry partners will be required. DARPA intends to fund these centers at funding ratios (DARPA : Industry) of 1:1 in each year of the program. In-kind cost sharing may be included in the proposed efforts, but only actual cash funding commitments will count toward required matching. In addition to required cost-sharing by industry organizations, cost-sharing contributions by academic institutions will be permitted and matched by DARPA at the same 1:1 ratio, but such university contributions will be limited to no more than 25% of the total cost-sharing amount for any funded center. University cost-sharing in the form of faculty salaries, however, is explicitly excluded.<br />All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this RA, should be directed to DARPA-RA-09-42@darpa.mil.</p>
<p>Full RA document attached.</p>

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Network Appliance support for existing SAN equipment at BIMC and KCC.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST Enterprise Systems owns and has in use Network Appliance SAN equipment.  As part of CA/CSTs migration from CLASS to eCLASS, CST purchased and installed 4 Storage Area Networks (SANs) from Network Appliances (NetApp).  The support for the hardware expired on 11/4/2008.  The SAN equipment, however, is still in use and is an essential part to CA/CST Enterprise Systems operations.  By extending the support for the equipment, CA can ensure that Network Appliance will provide premium 7x24 hour onsite support. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with the Network Appliance SAN equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use. According to Network Appliance, the only provider of Network Appliance SupportEdge Premium 7x24 4 hour onsite support is Network Appliance.  The services are currently not offered by any other provider.
CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Network Appliance SAN.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<p><br />Sources Sought Notice Information</p>
<p>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The NIAID provides immunological and virological support for nonhuman primate studies conducted at NIAID's Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit contract sites (SVEUs) and by AIDS vaccine researchers through three Nonhuman Primate Immunology and Virology Laboratories for AIDS Vaccine Research and Development, previously called the NHP "Core Laboratories." The objective of the Core Laboratories has been to insure standardization and comparability of the assays conducted for preclinical NHP studies and to provide a common basis for assessment of the immunogenicity and efficacy of candidate HIV and SIV vaccines.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives <br />The purpose of the proposed contract will be to support the development, conduct, and improvement of assays designed to evaluate and characterize the cellular immune responses of nonhuman primates that have been immunized with candidate HIV or SIV vaccines or infected with SIV, SHIV, or HIV in studies conducted at the NIAID Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit (SVEU) contract sites or by NIH-supported investigators.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />The contractor shall use state-of-the-art technologies, including ELISPOT, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), flow cytometry, and tetramer assays to accomplish the contract objectives, and shall incorporate new and improved technologies into contract activities when appropriate.

The space must be available for occupancy by June 1, 2009.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:<br />- Access to 2 parking spaces for Government vehicles <br />- Hours of Operation: Daily (Monday - Friday) with after-hour contact(s) available for emergency access<br />- Private (non-shared) space, e.g., access allowed only to Government and vendor<br />- Loading dock facility<br />- Not located in a flood plain<br />- Continuous Temperature control (maximum of 72&deg; F; minimum of 68&deg; F)<br />- Continuous Humidity control (maximum of 50%; minimum of 30%)<br />Any offered property must be located within the following delineated area: <br />North: 35&deg;28'51.07"N<br />South: 35&deg;27'46.86"N<br />East: 82&deg;34'21.18"W<br />West: 82&deg;35'10.13"W</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed-price contract to Norseman Defense Technologies (herein known as Norseman).  Norseman is currently under contract with the SEC to provide adequate power for the SEC-Chicago data center room located on the 9th floor at 175 West Jackson. The existing contract includes all facilities construction and building improvements required to support the computer room upgrade for standardization.  The additional work covered by this notice includes installation of a 20kW UPS system with racks and ISX488995-023 hardware in the computer room.  To have continuity of services and to assure schedule integrity, it is essential that Norseman install the additional work simultaneously with the original work which allows:  (1) both systems to be installed at the same time; (2) the SEC to save time and administrative cost by using the same building permit; (3) the SEC to utilize the same set of approved building plans to complete the project in its entirety; (4) the work is to be performed in a confined area which would restrict and possibly confuse work performed by multiple contractors.  The period of performance shall be through the completion of the project.  The SEC intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.  This is a Notice of Intent, not a solicitation.  No solicitation will be issued for this sole source requirement and no other information will be provided.

<SUBJECT>Software and/or Vendors to Host a Digital Library Specific to Human Resources Based Content Requirements
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFI-09-OP-CES-WLRC
<RESPDATE>061609
<CONTACT>Deborah R Wilson, Contract Specialist, Phone (410) 594-2016, Fax (410) 965-9560, Email deborah.r.wilson@ssa.gov - 
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS/ REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) to identify potential sources of supply

Reference Number: SSARFI-09-OP/CES/WLRC

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting MARKET RESEARCH to identify existing COTS software products and/or vendors capable of designing, maintaining, hosting and supporting a digital library specific to Human Resources based content requirements.  

Background

SSA currently provides its employees with a variety of work/life support materials including books, CDs, tapes, DVDs, etc.  These resources are provided to employees through an existing nationwide distribution network. A limited amount of material is provided to employees via an online website accessible through the SSA Intranet only.
The Agency also operates a traditional library of materials using both a “take-out” and a mail based distribution network to send materials to employees. These distribution models incur expenses to SSA, and at times results in delays in the delivery of materials. Also, due to the nature of the existing media, resources become outdated in a short amount of time and newer/ updated materials need to be procured and entered into the distribution network.  Additionally, employees in remote locations may lack suitable access to these materials, and most SSA employees do not have time during working hours to utilize Intranet resources.

The primary subject matter of the material currently distributed involves work/life topics including, but not limited to, the following:

•	Career Development
•	Elder Care
•	Child Care
•	Healthy Living (e.g., Nutrition, Fitness, Disease Prevention, Health, Management, Substance Abuse and Addiction)
•	Stress Management
•	Self-Help
•	Financial Planning
•	Management Support

Technical Requirements

SSA management has identified a need to enable all employees timely, convenient, and secure access to suitable work/life support materials. To address this need, SSA is seeking to identify existing virtual library type COTS software packages that will allow employees to access digital material using the Internet.

SSA’s existing market research indicates that library software products in the commercial marketplace are currently available through the internet platform known as Web 2.0.  
SSA is interested in suitable Web 2.0 based products that will allow for the publishing of print and electronic media and communication documents, books, research studies, and downloadable audio and video in multiple formats (e.g., MP3, RTF, PDF, etc..) and allow for such downloads to a wide range of current digital devices (e.g. MP3, iPod, iPhones, blackberries, personal computers, eReaders, etc..).  SSA seeks to identify such products that can be remotely hosted tracked and monitored for usage outside of SSA's enterprise network to enable employees nationally 24/7 access the information at home, work or other remote locations.

Ideally, the environment should be built and managed entirely by one vendor who is familiar with content management and can keep the content updated and dynamic.  Specific performance elements and technical characteristics that SSA has identified include:

•	Robust platform: migrate-able 2-D to 3-D environment as content becomes available in 3D
•	Architecture – exclusive access only to SSA employees; built and managed outside of the SSA network; tracking and monitoring capability
•	Fully-interactive, self-guided experience from any perspective, viewpoint or path; built to scale capable of live, archived and video 
•	Easy navigation, hyperlinks to reference the web, drag-and-drop and much more 
•	Library content resources – web 2.0 with platform and system ability to move into 3.0 environment as content is translated into 3-D
•	Ability to add/submit content in video, music, audio, links, etc.
•	Ready, easy access to content with "google-like" and indexing/mashing features

If purchased, such a remotely hosted products/ software as a service must be subject to SSA Office of Systems approval and enabling, and must meet applicable Federal and Agency standards for use by Agency employees with disabilities (i.e., Section 508, SSA Accessibility Standards). 

Administrative Requirements 

In addition to providing the software product as described above, SSA is interested in determining interested parties capabilities to provide associated administrative services related to the operation and maintenance of the system and the provisioning of content.  Hosted content should be available to users in part or full for identified topics, and retrievable via multiple options such as indexes, internal search engine, etc. Specifically, the provider will be responsible for editing, writing, proofing, researching, indexing, clear copywriting, fact-checking, sub-titling, and mapping all or some of the content hosted by the solution.  
Administrative services will include: 

•	archiving and inventory management services; 
•	digital-on-demand publishing; 
•	mail list and directory preparation; 
•	tracking and reporting user access;
•	website design and maintenance; and 
•	document security. 


In addition to the information requested above, vendor responses to this notice should:

• Be specific as to the product(s) proposed.
• Include a description of how the vendor’s product is commonly sold in the commercial marketplace (e.g., initial price approaches, user license based, transaction based recurring pricing, price policies for solution maintenance, hourly or engagement based services pricing). 
• Include information on pricing, such as commercial catalogs or price lists.
• Indicate whether their services/products are available on General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedules (GSA FSS’) or any other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC), and if applicable provide the relevant contract numbers.
• Provide examples of relevant corporate past performance information that demonstrates the vendor’s previous success in delivering solutions of similar size, scope, and complexity in the government or commercial marketplace.

Any firm that feels they have the capability of providing a product(s) that meets the requirements listed above must respond, in writing, via e-mail to the Contract Specialist by the response due date posted.  The Government will not consider vendor submissions of simple marketing materials or brochures, incomplete responses that do not conform to the elements of this request for information, or references to vendor websites.

This is not a request for proposal.  THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT ISSUING A FORMAL SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  The Government will not acknowledge requests for copies of a solicitation at this time.

The Government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in reply to this notice.  The Agency will use information submitted in response to this notice as market research efforts and for procurement planning purposes.  The Government reserves the right to contact, or not contact, any party responding to this notice in order to obtain further information for market research purposes.

Contractors must submit all responses in an electronic format (compatible with MS Office 2003) via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Deborah R. Wilson by the due date specified.  The Government will not consider faxed information.  The file size limitation for e-mail attachments is 5 megabytes. Electronic responses must be received by 5:00PM ET June 16, 2009.

<RESPDATE>071409
<CONTACT>Janice L. Uthe, Phone (202) 414-8974, Email janice.uthe@fhfa.gov
<DESC><p>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) was established by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (the Act), Title XIII of Public Law 102-550. The primary function of OFHEO is to ensure the capital adequacy and the financial safety and soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises), the dominant participants in the secondary mortgage market. OFHEO currently uses both a minimum capital measure and a risk-based capital measure to assess the capital adequacy of the Enterprises. On July 26, 2008, Congress passed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which merged OFHEO and the Federal Housing Finance Board to create a new Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).
<p>FHFA is considering developing a new risk based capital requirement that is consistent with best practice economic capital modeling in the financial services industry. In general, economic capital refers to any risk-based measure of capital necessary to protect against unexpected losses over a given period of time and at a given confidence level. Typically, economic capital models have market, credit and operational risk components that are estimated, forecasted, or simulated either separately or jointly. FHFA is seeking to acquire a flexible off-the-shelf Economic Capital Modeling software package with which to implement the risk based capital requirement for the Enterprises. Under this solicitation, FHFA is seeking a software package to implement the market and credit risk components only of economic capital, the software installation and implementation, model set up and user training, and software support modifications/updates, licensing, and maintenance.</p>
<p>FHFA anticipates soliciting and awarding one or more hybrid firm fixed-price and time-and-materials/labor hour contract(s). The Request for Proposal (RFP) is unrestricted. NAICS Code 511210 is applicable, and the small business size standard is $25 million. It is anticipated that Solicitation No. FHFA-09-R-0002 will be released in January, 2009, via posting on this website. No paper copies of the solicitation will be available. All offerors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">http://www.ccr.gov</a>.</p>
<p><br />All questions and correspondence shall be addressed to Janice Uthe at janice.uthe@fhfa.gov.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this &ldquo;sources sought&rdquo; is to identify hotels willing to provide meeting space, lodging, and meals in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area, in light of new guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs. Two of the new requirements prescribe limits for meals and refreshments served at breaks.</p>
<p>Regarding meals, the new guideline states that the cost of any meal provided, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 150 percent of the locality M&amp;IE per meal. For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $64.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $12.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $18.00 ($12.00 X 150%) per person. If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $64.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $18.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $27.00 ($18.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>The new guideline defines refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins. Under the new guidelines the cost of these items, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality (M&amp;IE) for both morning and afternoon breaks. For the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area, the M&amp;IE rate is $64.00 per person. Therefore, the cost of the refreshments cannot exceed $14.72 ($64.00 X 23%) per person per day.</p>
<p>Any hotel source interested and capable of providing lodging at the Federal per diem rates and meeting the new guideline requirements should submit a statement of capabilities, to include sleeping and meeting capacity, floor charts, and food and beverage menus, to the point of contact identified. The food and beverage menus should support the pricing mentioned above, including hotel service costs: breakfast, $12.00 per person; lunch, $18.00 per person; and refreshments for both morning and afternoon breaks, $14.72 per person. Interested hotels should respond by 3:00 p.m., Monday June 15, 2009.</p>

Exploratory Research Questions & Answers

Question 1:
Is the full proposal deadline June 5th or 9th? The original solicitation states June 5th, but your response to our white paper states June 9th.  Is 12:00 PM at noon or midnight?  Is Eastern time EST? 

Answer 1 :  
The proposal is due June 9th.  12:00 PM is 12:00 post meridiem or “after noon”.  Eastern is Eastern U.S. time, whether Daylight or Standard Time.

Question 2:
We have questions as to what the focus should be and what to optimize to, such as particles and energy ranges.

Answer 2: 
The topic areas in the solicitation describe what DNDO is asking for.  It is incumbent upon the proposers to describe what their concept is capable of as well as what it is best suited for, both in the context of the sub-topic areas described.

Question 3: 
In your response to our white paper, you recommend that we estimate the effective surface area efficiency. What is your exact definition of effective surface area efficiency?

Answer 3:
Ratio of particles detected to particles incident on total surface area of the sensitive portion of the detector.  The sensitive portion may or may not include active and inactive areas, such as for some types of pixilated devices.  The active fraction of a pixilated type device would be reflected in this efficiency.

Question 4:
Do you have a preferred detection unit size? This may not matter for the first proto-type, but for optimizing an eventual production unit, and our project strategy.

Answer 4: 
The topic areas in the solicitation describe what DNDO is asking for.  It is incumbent upon the proposers to describe what their concept is capable of as well as what it is best suited for, both in the context of the sub-topic areas described.

Question 5:
Generally, many of our questions arise because we don’t know in which context the final neutron detector we are designing is supposed to be used. Any information you can give us about the intended application would help us. E.g., do you want a portable, small unit, a single large-area unit, or a modular detection system?

Answer 5:
The topic areas in the solicitation describe what DNDO is asking for.  It is incumbent upon the proposers to describe what their concept is capable of as well as what it is best suited for, both in the context of the sub-topic areas described. 

Question 6:
Should a full proposal address only one Topic Area?

Answer 6:
This choice is entirely up to the proposers.  It is reasonable to expect that some concepts might apply to multiple topic areas or sub-topic areas, and the Full Proposal can be used to explain the entire application space.  However, each proposal should only be submitted for one topic area / sub-topic area.

Question 7:
We are considering a full proposal which involves a data management system. Does this system have the potential to satisfy the transformational research requirement of this solicitation?

Answer 7:
The topic areas in the solicitation describe what DNDO is asking for.  It is incumbent upon the proposers to describe what their concept is capable of as well as what it is best suited for, both in the context of the sub-topic areas described.

Question 8:

We have a proposal to that will contain classified material.  We are hoping to cull out and segregate the classified information in an addendum section, and send the main proposal via normal channels (DNDO submissions site).  Would this plan of action be acceptable?
 
Furthermore, we expect the addendum section to be restricted data.  However, I need to verify the classification with our Original Classification Authority.  Could you provide instructions guidance for sending the restricted data classified information?

Answer 8:
The instructions for classified is in the solicitation.  

Most classified documents have sections which are classified and sections which are not classified so please segment as appropriate.

<DESC>BID OPENING HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO JUNE 9, 2009 @ 11:00 P.M.1)	Understanding that the lowest bid will be likely accepted/approved, I noticed that the Statement of Work requests overhead patient lifts. Theres no statement made to permanently mounted patient ceiling lifts.  Is it accepted to sell a less expensive wall mount if bracing is installed per #15 of the Contractor/Vendor Responsibilities? No all ceiling lifts will be permanently mounted and hard wired.2)	#6 -of the Statement of Work indicates at installation of associated equipment will not exceed 24 hours. Could you please explain? The equipment must be installed in a very timely manner. Although we are asking for a 24 hour turn around the V.A. is flexible on the installation times, if a schedule can be worked out and the time required to install the units is defined.3)	#13- indicates that along with the electric shop, the electric load test will be monitored/conducted by the FC or a 3rd party. Can you tell me what FC stands for and if a 3rd party is used, who will incur that cost? The load test will be conducted by the contracted vendor, with the supervision of the V.A. The contracted vendor will provide a licensed  electrician. 4)	#15- Could you explain the term full room covering? I was given to understand that we had to stay inside the current tracks. In a 10 X 12 room do you want complete coverage of the room or coverage inside the curtain tracks only which could be 8 x 12? The lifts should prove coverage specified in the contract, if the system being provide by the contracted vendor exceeds the coverage, it will be excepted if costs do not exceed budget.In # 3 of Government Property and Services item c states Electrical needs are required prior to install.  Will the VA be providing the power outlets for the company awarded the bid? The VA will not provide and power outlets. If an existing outlet is available the contractor may use it if the VA agrees.In #4 General Information item b states the hours the awarded company is to workis this correct, we only work on Fri, Sat, Mon, Tues. from 8 to 1800?  Also out-patient from 1700-700 hours any day of the week? The contractor will need to be able to work night and weekends. The VA would like to work Monday thru Friday 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. but we will need to accommodate our veterans and this may require different hours.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - Task Order awarded for the Efficient Small Scale Propulsion (ESSP) Core Engine Demonstrator Design and Risk Reduction which obligates Recovery Act funding. The objective of the task order is to develop designs and perform risk reduction assessments for small versatile core engine concept that can be adapted to perform a wide range of military missions. The contract was solicited and awarded competitively using competitive procedures which resulted in award of 15 contracts. This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price contract type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded per FAR 16.301-2.</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-2
<AWDNBR>CDEN02381
<DESC>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition



1.	Requiring Activity: 	PIH-Real Estate Assessment Center
Contracting Activity: OCPO, Western (Denver) Field Contracting Operations
Requisition Number: 
Contract Number:	C-DEN-02381

2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: 

The Office of Public and Indian Housing Real Estate Assessment Center (PIH-REAC) hereby requests an emergency bridge contract for the continued and uninterrupted operation of the Technical Assistance Center (TAC, a multi-channel inquiry center providing user support for over 190,000 users of HUD Secure Systems subsystems) for the purposes of: 

•	providing continued program support while the recompete initiative for the new contract (C-DEN-02332) is in the final stages of completion, and,

•	providing adequate time for an appropriate transition period of all TAC services and business processes, from the incumbent contractor to the new contractor after award.

In order to provide continuity of this Departmental-wide program support, PIH-REAC’s needs for a multi-channel inquiry center operator capable of providing continued services without interruption is of a unusual and compelling nature.  PIH-REAC requires this action to offset the impact of the delay of a new 8(a) competitive contract award to provide these services for the Department.  The anticipated cost of this service is $1,391,131 for a period not to exceed seven (7) months total (see below).

The current expires 05/28/2009.  The proposed emergency bridge contract is required to allow sufficient time to award the new 8(a) competitive procurement and to allow for a transition period to implement the SOW under the new contract.  A Technical Evaluation Panel is currently evaluating proposals submitted for R-DEN-02332.  

3. Description of supplies or services required to meet PIH-REAC’s needs: 

The TAC services include operating a multi-channel (phone, email, fax, etc.,) inquiry center from 7:00 AM to 8:30 PM EST Monday through Friday, excluding Government holidays.  TAC personnel provide assistance across multiple HUD program areas by providing direct user support to 190,000 HUD internal and external stakeholders requiring access to HUD Secure Systems to complete statutorily-required electronic filings, answering general program status and technical questions from property inspectors, HUD Field Offices, housing authorities, management agents, residents, sponsors, other HUD and government officials and the general public.  TAC personnel also answer questions about PIH-REAC business processes; facilitate the resolution of any problems users may experience with using PIH-REAC systems; support communications with program participants in selected business areas; and support PIH-IT system releases throughout the year. 

The structure of the proposed emergency bridge contract is for a base period of three (3) month periods, an option of three (3) months the option period will only be exercised if needed due to exigent circumstances – and a one (1) month transition period.  

The total period of performance of this emergency bridge contract will not exceed seven (7) months.  The total estimated dollar value of this emergency contract if all options are exercised is between $1,200,000.00 and $1,500,000.00.


4.	Identification of the statutory authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: 

41 USC 253 (c) (2) (FAR 6.302-2) - Unusual and Compelling Urgency.

5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. 

CCSi has proven its capability to satisfactorily operate the TAC over the past three years and four months.  While there are other 8(a) vendors that are believed to be capable of operating TAC, only the current incumbent is capable of performing all the required services starting on day one of the proposed emergency bridge contract term and is likewise the only vendor capable of performing the requisite transition activities to the new SOW.  Virtually all other potential vendors would require start-up activities and transition time to perform all of the services required under this contract. Given the urgent and compelling need for the TAC services, an award to other than the incumbent at this time would result in a disruption of services creating an unacceptable lapse in services for the Department with the potential to put both the Department and HUD stakeholders at substantial technical, legal and fiscal risk.


6. 	A description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable, including whether a FEDBIZOPPS notice was or will be published as required by FAR 5.2, and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 

There are no plans to solicit alternative sources for this action.  The requirement for notice to potential sources, for example through publication FedBizOps pursuant to FAR Subpart § 5.2, is specifically exempted for contract actions subject to the conditions of unusual and compelling urgency in which the Government would be seriously injured by the delays that such notice requires.  The exemption is specifically provided in FAR §5.202(a)(2). 

However, the current 8(a) competitive solicitation resulted in several proposals from 8(a) firms.  These proposals are currently being evaluated by a Technical Evaluation Panel.

It is this office's desire to maximize the use of competition.  Accordingly, the procurement strategy for the follow on competition (R-DEN-02332) has generated adequate  response to a competitive 8(a), best-value procurement, utilizing price and technical factors.  As the closing date of the solicitation was the required 30 days after issuance of the solicitation, we believe sufficient time was provided to insure that we have achieved the maximum competition among eligible 8(a) firms while simultaneously achieving the mandated 8(a) program goals. 


7. 	The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 

The prior procurement strategy and the current pending contracting action provided for 8(a) competition.  Extensive market research was conducted for both actions with separate independent government cost estimates developed: the anticipated cost to the Government of this emergency bridge contract action is consistent with those price ranges, adjusted for the short term nature of the contract vehicle and transition period.  The government will use a combination of cost and price analysis techniques; comparison of previously proposed prices and previous government contract prices for the same items to determine proposed cost to be fair and reasonable.

8. 	A description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted: 

Market Research was conducted for the current solicitation that is currently under evaluation by using a Source Sought announcement for a competitive 8(a) procurement and since the closing date of this solicitation sufficient competition has been received. No further market research was conducted because of the nature of the short term bridge contract. 

9. 	Any other facts supporting the use of other full and open competition: 

Performance in-house by government employees is not a feasible alternative due to the unavailability of the special technical skills required to perform these tasks and the lack of time in which to train them.  

There is not adequate time to transition a new or different contractor to absorb the institutional knowledge of PIH-REAC TAC necessary to continue seamless operations to meet the goals of PIH-REAC and the Department.

(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. 

A complete statement of work, detailing the type and level of services to be delivered during the short term emergency bridge contract term and transition period has been developed (see attached 720 package).

(ii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. 

The PIH-REAC Technical Assistance Center performs integral activities daily to directly support the Department’s Mission to ‘increase homeownership, support community development and increase access to affordable housing free from discrimination. To fulfill this mission, HUD will embrace high standards of ethics, management and accountability and forge new partnerships--particularly with faith-based and community organizations--that leverage resources and improve HUD's ability to be effective on the community level.’  

TAC operations, as currently performed by CCSi, directly impact the achievement of major goals detailed in the Department’s FY2006—2011 Strategic Framework.  TAC support of HUD Secure System stakeholders is essential to the accomplishment of four of the six Strategic Goals.  

Without the ongoing TAC support to the more than 190,000 external and internal Secure Systems users and stakeholders, the Department cannot meet these goals.  Moreover, the business processes that require Secure Systems access are integral to the Department’s activities regarding the disbursement of funds, insuring that properties in which it has an interest meet exigent health and safety standards and serve general oversight and accountability functions.  

10.	 A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. 

See item #6 above.

11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the services or supplies are required. 

TAC services are normally procured on an 8(a) competitive basis and HUD will continue to procure these services competitively.  The current solicitation for these services received vigorous competition and the anticipated date of the new award is August 1, 2009.
