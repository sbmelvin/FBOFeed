<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation,Federal Highway Administration(FHWA)will be seeking applications from State Departments of Transportation or public safety agencies as leaders of a team. The team would consist of a transportation service provider that operates a Traffic Management Center(TMC), a Traffic Management Center systems integrator, and a public safety Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) integrator. The team will integrate ITS technologies and CAD systems from multiple vendors across organizational boundaries. ITS standards and development procedures will be incorporated in a Field Operational Test      (FOT). The goal of this prospective Cooperative Agreement is to enable improved emergency response through the integration of public safety CAD systems and Advanced Traffic Management systems (ATMS) that are an integral part of most TMCs.

The FOT will integrate traffic management information systems and public safety dispatch information systems to enhance emergency response. This test will focus on the standards and technologies needed to facilitate the exchange of information between public safety CAD systems and TMC information systems. The FOT will be structured around the capability to manage multi-agency emergency incidents with significant multi-modal transportation challenges, ranging from automobile crashes to disaster response. Further, the FOT will enable benefits of enhancing field operations related to locating and responding to the incident, on-scene activities, and documenting the incident to be realized.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) has a requirement for twenty-three (23) ACU-1000 Modular Interconnect Systems to support telecommunications interoperability among agencies that have differing radio systems operating in different radio frequency bands.  The ACU-1000 is a communications switch that allows wireless communication systems to be combined at the audio base-band by using the received audio from one system as the source audio for one or more transmitters of differing technologies.  The ACU-1000 modular interface/interconnect system can be configured to meet almost any interface application involving telephones and radios. The system is suitable for HF, Land Mobile Radio, Military, and SATCOM systems and offers essentially unlimited applications for interoperability.  This procurement will be negotiated on a sole source basis with JPS Communications, Inc., Raleigh, NC.  JPS Communications, Inc. is the sole designer, developer, and producer of the ACU-1000 Modular Interconnect System.  As such, they alone possess the requisite corporate knowledge and technical expertise necessary to satisfy the Marine Corps requirement.  This equipment is unique in that it is the only interconnect system that has the capability of allowing twelve or more previously incompatible communication systems to be directly connected providing real time interoperability.

<DESC>It is the intent of this solicitation to contract for all labor, material and equipment to Repair Bullard Hall (Bldg. 233) Project RC 12-02 at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA.  Work includes but is not limited to: repair and partial replacement of the electrical system with relocation of the inner transformers to an outside pad mount, total repair of the mechanical system, bringing the building to code in fire and life safety, re-roofing the building, minor construction of new office space, and renovation of existing office and classrooms. Background information:  Bullard Hall was constructed around 1952, and contains approximately 24,000 SF on two levels.  The building has large open spaces toward the core with offices, labs, and smaller classrooms on the perimeter.  The current electrical system is a mix of many different power ratings and was designed to mimic shipboard conditions on older ships.  The mission of the school has changed negating the need for the dated system.  The ventilation of the building is currently met by natural ventilation from the windows and minor forced air in the core labs.  Currently 5,000 SF of the building is air conditioned with a plan to add a chilled water type system to provide for flexibility in air conditioning.  Steam unit heaters currently provide for heating.  Many larger spaces have been subdivided to add needed office space.  This in turn has left areas without proper ventilation and heating.  The plan is to meet the heating need with a central station pre-heat and perimeter zone baseboard type system.  The building will require minor demolition of existing walls and the addition of new walls on both levels and six new office spaces on the second floor.  The building will be occupied for the duration of the contract. Proposer will be provided one occupied floor at a time.  Utility outages (electrical, HVAC etc.) will be kept to a minimum limiting the disruption to the customer, i.e., during weekends or school breaks.  This is a firm-fixed-price contract.  The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This procurement is an 8(a) certified contractor competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 233320, and the related small business size standard is $28.5 million.

<DESC>This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). This BAA is also listed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm  (Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations). 

I. INTRODUCTION.  The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR) is soliciting proposals for research and development (R&D) concepts in sensor integration and communication technologies. Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology. 

II. BACKGROUND.  NAVAIR is working with sponsor agencies to advance the science and technology of sensor integration and testbed technologies. Future weapon systems will increasingly rely on the merging of sophisticated datasets collected from a myriad of collection sources. The promise of combining sensor data into a single integrated picture of the battlespace depends on key advances in sensor data networking and integration architecture. Developmental and operational testbed activities focused on these systems architectures systems must be adaptable to accommodate the most recent technological advances in both sensors and weapons systems. The overall program objectives are: (A) to explore new concepts in both sensor integration and testbed design and applications architectures, (B) invest in key technologies and create adaptations to better suit the needs of the war-fighting community, (C) certify the sustainability and safety of candidate systems, and (D) promote those systems through the procurement process. The size, weight, and cost of the sensor system or sensor network are of particular concern.  Historically, the preponderance of awards have been in the area of one-to-ten million dollars; however, this does not preclude awards of a lower or higher dollar value.

III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST.   Proposals are being solicited in three areas:

A.	New Operational Concepts for integration of sensors with aircraft and weapons, both unmanned and manned. New approaches and applications for integrated sensors. New testbed architectures for supporting advanced weapon system concepts. Concepts should address possible ways to deploy and operate systems from Naval Aircraft or from sea-based platforms. Examples of the type of concepts that could be proposed are:  

1.	Sensor integration concepts such as reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition (RSTA) cloud concepts with multiple, smart, or computational sensors operating collaboratively to create seamless view of the battle space.
2.	Real-time sensor data networking concepts involving high-speed nodes and an instantaneous view of critical battle space elements.
3.	Concepts involving rapidly deployable sensor networks.
4.	Concepts involving innovative solutions to urban warfare missions, particularly those supporting rapid reconnaissance and coordinated precision fires.
5.	Concepts involving new approaches to conducting integrated testing of future weapons systems utilizing advanced sensor inputs.
6.	Large area concepts where low-power, deeply deployed sensors communicate over large areas or relay data to an airborne or shipboard control station.
7.	Virtual test range concepts employing sensors integrated with simulated activities to provide realistic environmental data.
8.	Sensor networking or testbed concepts that have dual use applications including counter terrorism, homeland security, force protection, and humanitarian and disaster relief.

B. Technologies that advance the state-of-the-art in performance and suitability of theatre-wide or tactical sensor networks.

1.	Multi-mode integrated electronics technologies that combine distributed sensor components to form a combined data output.
2.	Advanced communications and networking component technologies that offer significant improvement beyond the state-of-the-art.
3.	Advanced weapons technologies with sophisticated on-board processing for complex or alternative forms of sensor data input.
4.	Innovative tools, encryption devices, and networking algorithms for instantaneous remote sensor integration.
5.	Condition-based sensor cueing and remote sensor management technologies. 
6.	Ultra-wide-band or other geolocation sensor network technologies. 
7.	Advanced sensor technology offering improved data collection and conditioning, larger field of regard or instantaneous signal bandwidth.
8.	Small, ruggedized packaging concepts for processing, routers, data servers, and other components for fiber optic, optical and wireless RF communication and relay nodes.

C.	 Systems Integration and Demonstration Testing will apply newly developed or transitioning technology from R&D agencies to determine various aspects of utility, supportability and potential for integration into USN/USMC systems.

1.	Testbed demonstration activities utilizing state-of-the-art sensors in collaborative mode.
2.	Networking and data link system demonstrations for transmittal of imagery and multiplexed sensor data.  New approaches for high-bandwidth, multiplexed, digital, LPI/LPD links as well as approaches for network management.
3.	Fires and targeting demonstrations utilizing sensor networks or relays from a sensor network to transient platform such as UAV, a weapon, or group of loitering munitions.
4.	 Applications that address issues of autonomous or semi-autonomous, advanced weapons seeker requirements.
5.	Test activities for high energy weapons or weapons requiring increased target dwell time and utilizing networked command, control and diagnostic sensing.
6.	RSTA demonstrations to provide complete instantaneous awareness of a battlespace and communication of information to battlespace components.
7.	Mobile sensors and sensor grid demonstrations that provide real-time sensing and communication of a tactical perimeter.
8.	Urban warfare applications utilizing unique deployment, C4I and sensor control schemes.
9.	Dual use test and demonstration activities addressing needs for homeland defense, counter terrorism, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

IV. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE.  NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions).  Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other_trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research, or by contacting Sue R. Wainwright at (301) 757-9746 or by e-mail at wainwrightSR@navair.navy.mil.  Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.

NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

V. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. No request for proposal (RFP), solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Submit proposals in two (2) STEPS. 

A.	STEP I - Proposal Abstracts:   Submit Proposal Abstract, not to exceed fifteen pages, any time during the above stated open period. The Proposal Abstracts will be evaluated at a minimum quarterly.

<CONTACT>Cheryl Miles, 301-619-7148
<DESC>NA Research Program in Technologies for Metabolic Monitoring (TMM), FY02 Announcement SUMMARY: The US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) in support of the TMM Program (which also included the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, NASA and HIH/NIDDK) is soliciting new, novel and unconventional approaches to the field of metab olic monitoring and diabetes measurement and control.  This solicitation is open to agencies of local, state and federal governments; educational institutions; non-profit organizations and private industry, both foreign and domestic.  It is anticipated tha t approximately $3 million will be awarded for “seed funding” of new, novel and innovative ideas associated with metabolic monitoring.  No single award will exceed $250k, nor extend beyond a period of 12 months performance.  Proposals are due by 4:00 PM Ea stern Time, 2 July 2002 to be eligible for consideration. The goals of this research program are to identify and assess technologies that can improve our ability to collect and interpret metabolic data in fixed environments as well as untethered situations using remote systems and telemetry, and to use that data to extend our understanding of human metabolism in healthy, diseased, and stressed states.  The end goal is to improve our understanding of human metabolism, and our ability to monitor it, so that we can predict and respond to the effects of external and i nternal stimuli in order to enhance the sustainability and survivability of soldiers on the battlefield as well as improve the health and quality of life of other at-risk populations, civilian as well as military. Background: Blood Glucose measurement is currently the gold standard of diabetes monitoring, and can also serve as an indicator of a non-diabetic individual’s nutritional status and health status, including military personnel in the field.  While glucose m easurement is certainly of great continuing importance and interest, recent research and discussions seem to indicate that opportunities exist in measurement and analysis of other analytes. In general, progress in the field of metabolic monitoring, and specifically glucose monitoring, has been relatively slow, as glucose has proven difficult to measure, correlate and ultimately use as a predictor of metabolic status.   Blood glucose has tradi tionally been felt to be the ‘real time’ measure of diabetes or nutritional status, but there are continuing uncertainties about the location and interpretation of measurements from alternate sites. An alternate metabolic measure that preceded and predicte d, or could be complementary to, glycemic fluctuations, might be desirable. For example, such a metabolic measure could provide an additional signal for incorporation in the metabolic sensor algorithm and provide a more accurate monitor of metabolic state.   This information has potential utility for monitoring the diabetic state but also in better monitoring and potentially predicting the nutritional and health status of military and other personnel in critical care situations in the field (i.e. firefighter s, air traffic controllers, pilots, etc.). Research Proposal Topics: The TMM program is seeking proposals related to metabolic monitoring but unconstrained by conventional and classic approaches.  These efforts should be new and novel in their approach to metabolic monitoring, while at the same tim e maintaining a high level of scientific credibility and relevance to real-world applications in healthy and diseased individuals.  While the fields of glucose monitoring specifically, and diabetes in general, are certainly of interest, there is no require ment that proposals directly or indirectly address these areas. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: ·	Instrumentation and sensors, ·	Data analysis, ·	Modeling and simulation. Application Materials and Procedures: The proposal will consist of two sections, a technical proposal and an administrativ e portion containing specific forms and processing information.  These sections must be in accordance with relevant portions (primarily proposal preparation section) of BAA 02-1 (available at http://www-usamraa.army.mil.  Once you access the web site, sele ct “Products” in the blue bar located on the left hand side.  Click on the “Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) List” link.  The USAMRMC BAA 02-1, Appendices are located at the “USAMRMC BAA 02-1” link.  The FY02 Supplement is located at the “USAMRMC BAA Announ cements” link.) The technical SOW is not to exceed 5 pages and is to include the following sections: ·	Brief summary of concept (not to exceed ½ page in length), ·	Background and discussion of relevant work in the field, ·	Discussion of concept, ·	Timeline of objectives. The administrative portion must include the following appendices from BAA 02-1: ·	Cover Page (Appendix 3), ·	Detailed Cost Estimate (Appendix 6), ·	Certificate of Environmental Compliance (Appendix 8), ·	Safety Program Plan (Appendix 11), ·	Representation for Assistance Agreements (Appendix 12). If applicable, the following must also be included: ·	Research involving human subjects and anatomical substances (Appendix 9), ·	Research involving animals (Appendix 10). Anticipated Awards: Awards are anticipated to take the form of grants to each selected organization. It is anticipated that awards will be announced on or about 15 August 2002.  Proposal evaluation and selection: The TMM Programmatic Review Team will perform the reviews, with input from an external, scientific peer review committee. •Assessment criteria (in terms of priority) 1.	Application to general goals (especially innovation), 2.	Scientific validity, 3.	Cost realism, 4.	Teaming with government agencies, (Not required but encouraged and looked upon favorably) •Matching Funds: While not a specific, rated criteria or requirement, matching resources by researchers will be looked upon favorably. PROPOSAL RECEIPT DEADLINE AND PROCEDURES: Unlike other proposals submitted under BAA 02-1, which can be submitted throughout the year, the complete FY02 TMM proposal packages are due no later than 2 July 2002 at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time.  Clearly mark all p ackages as “FY02 TMM Research Program.”  The complete submission should include: the original proposal, 10 copies of the proposal, an electronic copy of the proposal (in a format readable by IBM-compatible versions of Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat) on a formatted disk or CD.  Proposals should be sent by mail, courier, or hand delivered to the following address: FY02 TMM Research Program, U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity ATTN: MCMR-AAA/Cheryl R.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>AFMETCAL Det 1 has a requirement for 7 each Capacitance Standards Sets in accordance with Directorate of Metrology Purchase Description 2M02-1-14, Revision 2, dated 14 May 2002. This is brand name or equal to the Andeen-Hagerling AH 1100 Capacitance Standard Frame and AH 11A capacitance standards. This capacitance standards set will provide calibration support to the Andeen-Hagerling AH 2700A multi-frequency capacitance bridge. The capacitance frame will be standard width, bench-top or rack mountable.  This frame can hold up to four fused silica capacitance standards.  The frame provides the electrical power to operate a precision temperature controlled oven for increased stability.  The frame will contain three capacitance standards and a three-terminal BNC pass through connection.  The following are salient characteristics: The frame will contain three fused silica capacitance standards that have a capacitance value of  0.99950pf, 9.9995pF and 99.99950pF. The capacitance frame will contain one three terminal BNC connector pass through. This pass through is used to bring the Andeen-Hagerling capacitance bridge terminals on the back of the instrument to the front of the frame. The capacitance frame will be capable of holding four fused silica capacitance standards. This frame will use three positions for capacitance standards with values shown in paragraph 4.1 of the purchase description and the remaining position for a front terminal pass through as described in paragraph 4.2 of the purchase description. The frame will provide power to a precision controlled oven. The frame will provide metering circuits that monitor the internal power voltages and temperatures.  Connections to the three capacitance standards will be made independently from pairs of BNC connectors on the front of the frame. The capacitance values will have a NIST or NPL traceable accuracy of 2 +1/C ppm @ 1kHz ("C" is the capacitance value in pF).

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), on behalf of its National Petroleum Technology Office (NPTO), seeks applications for cost-shared long-term (7-10 years), high-risk research and  development ( R & D), including fundamental research and optimization of important, state-of-the art oil/gas technologies, for future applications on  domestic areas  including  on state and federal lands and waters.  These longer-term, high-risk research activities emphasize new concepts and /or approaches that may lead to significant revolutionary (i.e., not evolutionary)  advancements in the state-of-the-art oil/gas technology  by reducing risks, costs, and environmental impacts associated with finding and producing U. S. petroleum resources.  The projects in this program may be designed to yield specific solutions to exploration and production problems including issues of public lands, and  allowing real returns from these lands and waters while preserving the Nation?s asset. The goal is to develop world class technologies that will provide the domestic industry a leadership role in discovery and the development of undiscovered or previously unattainable resources. This new initiative will focus longer-term fundamental R&D in the following three broad areas: 1) Oil and Gas Recovery Technology, 2) Advanced Drilling, Completion, Stimulation, and Operations (ADCS), or 3) Advanced Diagnostic and Imaging Systems (ADIS) and Reservoir Characterization.

China to conduct research studies on occupational cancer risks.
The Occupational Epidemiology Branch conducts research studies on occupational causes of cancer.  An important component of these studies is the exposure assessment. An innovative approach to exposure assessment has been developed recently by investigators with the Occupational Epidemiology Branch that uses work history questionnaires supplemented with information from job modules.  The Occupational Epidemiology Branch is currently collaborating with the Shanghai Cancer Institute on the Shanghai Women?s Health Study being conducted in Shanghai that uses detailed questionnaires to explore occupational cancer risks under an NCI contract.  This procurement is related to this study to investigate the level of misclassification arising from use of these questionnaires as compared to more traditional approaches of assessing exposure.  The objective of this contract is to obtain the services necessary to administer questionnaires and collect air and biological samples for 240 subjects at 12 different factories in Shanghai. It is important that the evaluation be done in the area of Shanghai so as to allow proper interpretation of the epidemiologic analysis in that study.  The Shanghai Municipal Center is the only agency in Shanghai that has historic measurement data on employers in this region of China. The Shanghai Municipal Center has substantial experience in collecting airborne measurement data, and they are the only group that has insight into the peculiarities of the data.  Based on the above facts The Shanghai Municipal Center is the only source known to NCI investigators that can provide the above services.  The period of performance shall be for 1 year from date of award with an additional 1year option if exercised by the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, including all techniques and demonstrated expertise, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet this requirement.  Capability Statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on June 14, 2002. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendors  responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted

<DESC>In approximately 15 to 19 days of this Synopsis issuance, REDSO/ESA will post full Request for Proposals (RFP) solicitation for the implementation of a Regional Agricultural Trade Expansion Support (RATES) project.  The primary objective of the RATES program is be to increase the value/volume of agricultural trade within the East and Southern Africa region and between the region and the rest of the world by 35% in the next five years i.e. 2002 - 2007.  

Whereas past REDSO/ESA efforts in this area have dwelled more on the broad trade facilitation issues related, development literature and experience in the region and elsewhere suggests that it is difficult to achieve such an objective without concentrating at least some support on particular commodities.  Vertical involvement in designated industries or commodity chains also makes it possible to tackle barriers to trade of a broader nature, both because of the experiential learning that takes place and because of the private sector involvement that vertical activities tend to attract.  

However, even within the agricultural sector alone there are structural concerns that are not specific to a single commodity or commodity cluster but which either reduce the efficiency or transparency of trading itself or reduce competitiveness in a global marketplace. Agriculture-specific cross-cutting concerns include such topics as grades and standards, sanitary and phyto-sanitary regulations, agricultural marketing institutions, and intellectual property rights (e.g. plant variety protection, genetically-modified organisms). Such broad issues, not specific to any commodity chain or technical topic, are essential and complementary to vertical supply chain development. 

In order to respond to both kinds of trade constraints, vertical as well as broad, REDSO/ESA has decided to adopt a hub-and-satellite approach for the RATES program. The satellites will aim at enhancing trade efficiency and competitiveness along selected commodity supply chains. In some special cases, satellites may be set up to handle thematic issues.  The Hub will be a specialized service center intended to handle the broad cross-cutting issues in support of the interventions to be undertaken by the satellites.  The driving force behind the skill composition and actions of the Hub will therefore be the satellite activities and common issues that cut across them.  In addressing these issues, the Hub will address broad agricultural trade facilitation activities in close collaboration with regional inter-governmental organization such as COMESA, IGAD, EAC, IBAR, and private sector organizations.  

The requirements falls into North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 5416 (Management, Scientific and Technical Consulting Services), its Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) cross-reference is code 8742 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting).  Full-and-open competition (no set-asides or other limitations on competition) procedure will be followed to select winning U.S. contractor.      

The level of funding for this project is anticipated to be in $10-20 million range over the five year period. Bidders will be encouraged to sub-contract or form consortiums. Involvement of local African firms (through subcontracting with prime U.S.-based contractor) will be strongly advantageous to Project objectives. The winning bidder will  work mainly in the East and Southern Africa but will have to collaborate with relevant institutions based elsewhere.

Full description of the requirements will appear in the RFP Solicitation.

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to extend the Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) contracts with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) (NAS2-98002) and System Resources Corporation (SRC)/Titan (NAS2-98005) pursuant to FAR Part 6.302(a)(2)(iii).  The AATT NRA contracts are five year, fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts in a multiple award task order environment where all task orders are competed.  Current contract completion dates are November 12, 2002.  Extension of these contracts will be for one year, from November 13, 2002 through November 12, 2003.  No follow-on contracts will be issued.   The AATT Project is responsible for defining, exploring, and developing advanced air traffic system concepts to a level suitable for pre-production prototype assessment by the FAA which, if successful, will result in full-scale deployment.  The work under the AATT NRA contracts supports the AATT Project which is organized into six topical areas of research:  Air Transportation Management Concept Definition and Integration; Benefits and Safety Assessment; Human Factors and Operations; Terminal/Surface Systems and Operations; En Route Systems and Operations; and Aircraft Systems and Operations. The AATT NRA contracts consist of Task Orders for Air Traffic Management (ATM) research and related activities with emphasis on activities for concept development and evaluation.  The activities may involve benefit/cost analyses, safety analysis and human factors assessments to identify and justify concepts, technologies and methodologies worthy of further ATM research.  The activities may also include research leading to the conceptual design of automation tools to assist the air traffic controller, airline operations specialist, or pilot.  Development of experimental systems may be required for concept evaluation.  This development may involve the creation of software to demonstrate algorithms being studied.  To support specific ATM operational concepts, the activities may examine specific issues in human factors, benefits and safety assessments that focus on human performance, system performance and safety models.   SAIC and SRC/Titan are the only companies that have been on the AATT NRA contracts for the full five years because they have provided the expertise required of these contracts.  As such, SAIC and SRC/Titan have developed a unique knowledge base and possess the expertise to successfully continue the research.  This is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis is not considered a request for proposals.  There is no solicitation document available.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 local time on June 13, 2002.  Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:   http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>This is an amendment 0001 - it answers questions submitted in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Virginia Contracting Activity on behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency, request for proposals in support of the attached Statement of Work for a technological upgrade of the existing turnstiles at Building 6000, 200 MacDill Blvd., Bolling AFB, Washington, DC.  The existing turnstiles use a turnbuckle resistance arm and only provide narrow lanes (24 inches clearance) for the majority of DIA employees and visitors.  Optical turnstiles are a current technology upgrade and meet all current ADA, life safety, and fire safety requirements.  They also reduce the need for constant vigilance of uniformed officers at access and egress points.  Turnstiles provide a necessary Force Protection Service by controlling the flow of personnel, ensuring that properly ?badged? personnel are allowed in and out, and provide additional force protection measures in the event of an emergency.  The current turnstiles do not provide adequate force protection measures.  The proposed upgrade of DIAC turnstiles is necessary to bring this equipment to the current state-of-the-art technology.  Each of the 8 lanes will meet fire safety, life safety, and ADA requirements.  A Firm Fixed-Price award will be issued to the offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government (Best Value), on the basis of technical approach, expertise/experience and cost. Technical approach and expertise/experience are significantly more important than cost.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular, FAC 01-06.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Offerors should submit their responses IAW the directions in the attached RFP document.  The Request for Quotation has the Statement of Work can be accessed at this site under MDA908-02-Q-0141. 

Bid should be submitted via email at:  jill.kline@dia.mil;   Subject line MUST read: MDA908-02-Q-0141 or Faxed to 202-231-2831. Offerors are responsible for confirming that submissions were received by the contracting office before bid closing.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD announces its intent to contract for a Noise Reduction System for the C-9B (DC-9-32F) Aircraft.  This effort will require a Federal Aviation Administration Supplemental Type Certificate for Navy C-9B Aircraft that meets or exceeds the Stage III Noise Levels as specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations, Chapter 1, Part36.5(a)3, appendix C.  This is a non-developmental effort; the Government is seeking a Noise Reduction System with proven performance in the commercial fleet.  In addition, the modification must meet the following requirements:

1.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Takeoff Weight of 110,000 pounds must be maintained.
2.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Landing Weight of 102,000 pounds with 40 degree Approach Flaps must be maintained.
3.	The rated engine thrust of a Stage II Configured Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines, as currently used on the C-9B Aircraft, must not be adversely affected.
4.	Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption of the currently installed Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines must not be adversely affected.
5.	Reliability and maintainability of Navy C-9B Aircraft and JT8D-9A Engines, as currently configured, must not be adversely affected.
6.	Any increase in Aircraft Empty Weight must not exceed 350 pounds.
7.	The system must be supportable by 2-level maintenance concept, O to D.
8.	The system should require no new or critical logistics support resource requirements.
9.	Must not require any additional transportability requirements.
10.     System should have no adverse impact on aircraft range, as currently configured.

The Government will require pre and post-Hushkit engine and aircraft performance data regarding, but not limited to, such factors as; Thrust, Fuel Flow (TSFC, Total Fuel Burn) and Acceleration (Spool-Up) Time.  The Goverment also desires an on-site review of all technical data presented by the Contractor to the FAA, as the basis for granting of the Stage III Hushkit STC.

The Government intends to award either one or two firm fixed price contracts for two of the major tasks required to complete this modification: 1. Acquisition of the STC Data and airframe parts required; and, 2.  Installation/integration of the airframe parts and JT8D-9A Engines, following modification o fthose engines to a Stage III configuration.  All work is to be accomplished in accordance with the FAA STC, the Navy Approved Aircraft Maintenance Manual, and the Pratt & Whitney Approved Maintenance Manual for the JT8D-9A Engine.  Prospective offerors may submit proposals for one, or both, of these tasks.  The offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government will be awarded a contract for that task.  If one offeror provides the best value for performing both tasks, one contract will be awarded to that offeror.    

This procurement will be conducted using the principles outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The Navy intends to release the Request for Proposals, including any subsequent amendments, only over the Internet.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Simplified procedures as described in FAR 12.3 will be used for acquisition of these commercial items.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

Solicitation Number N00421-02-T-0067 is being released using simplified acquisition procedures as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.3, and is therefore issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  The incorporated document and provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement Change Notice 20001213.  

The Government intends to award a contract on a "brand name mandatory" basis for Microsoft Corporation software under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Contract type will be firm-fixed price.  Microsoft Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the software currently in use in the existing systems.  The use of another manufacturer's software would not guarantee the conversion of existing files to an accurate or usable format because no other manufacturer makes a software application that is 100% interoperable and compatible with the Microsoft applications currently in use.  Due to the proprietary nature of Microsoft technical information, as described in FAR 27.401, "Restricted computer software," and DFARS 227.7202-1(c)(1), Microsoft is the sole manufacturer with the exclusive technical capabilities to fulfill the Government's minimum requirements.  The contract line item numbers (CLIN) and descriptions for this brand name mandatory procurement are: ** CLIN 0001 Windows XP Professional, Upgrade MVL  (P/N: E85-00345)(Qty of 100); CLIN 0002 Windows XP Professional Disk Kit, CD Keyless (P/N: E85-00315)(Qty of 1); CLIN 0003 Office XP Professional (P/N: 269-04652)(Qty of 100); CLIN 0004 Project 2002 MVL-D W32 (P/N: 076-01151)(Qty of 100); CLIN 0005 Project 2002 Disk Kit, CD Keyless (P/N: 076-01683)(Qty of 1); CLIN 0006 Exchange Server CAL 2000 MVL-D (P/N: 381-01445)(Qty of 300); CLIN 0007 Exchange Server 2000, MVL-WINNT (P/N: 312-01320)(Qty of 1); CLIN 0008 Exchange Server CAL 2000, Disk Kit (P/N: 312-01801)(Qty of 1); CLIN 0009 Windows CAL 2000 MVL-D (P/N: C78-00113)(Qty of 300); CLIN 0010 Office XP Professional, Disk Kit, CD Keyless (P/N: 269-04926)(Qty of 1); CLIN 0011 Windows Server 2000 MVL-D (P/N: C11-00222)(Qty of 1); and CLIN 0012 Windows Server 2000 Disk Kit with Boot Disks CD (P/N: C11-00049)(Qty of 1).**  A copy of the representations and certifications may be found on the NAVAIR Homepage at www.navair.navy.mil/ business/ecommerce/index.cfm.

<DESC>Furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, tools, materials, operations and all associated work required to perform Firm-Fixed Price Structural Repairs to Pier 4, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, WA in accordance with contract specifications, which include, but are not limited to: 
Epoxy injection of cracks, repair of spalls and delaminations, underwater concrete repair, structurally upgrading the load capacity on the approach section, polyurethane injection of construction joints between Bents 24 to 37, repair of an expansion joint, and replacement of the catwalks and ladders of Pier 4.  The repairs also include performing bond capacity tests on the repair and upgrade materials and other incidental related work.
The primary goal of this project is to extend the useful life of the pier.  This is achieved by filling existing cracks, repairing deteriorated concrete, and replacing corroded reinforcing steel.  Piling and cylinders will also be repaired with specialty underwater materials and methods.
The estimated duration of the project is 20 months.  It is anticipated that the Contractor will be required to work around ongoing operations occurring both on the deck and alongside the pier, requiring a substantial coordination effort between the Contractor and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) during the project. The Contractor will be required to remove all equipment and materials that may interfere with PSNS operations upon a 48-hour notice.
The contract is broken into four phases to control the project quantities and schedule.   Phase A is all work to the 1933 approach section, including repairs, upgrades, and replacements above mean higher high water (MHHW).  Phase B is the 1914 pier section above MHHW, and Phase C is the 1923 pier section above MHHW.  Underwater (below MHHW) work is lumped into Phase D.  Phase D is an overlapping phase to occur sometime during the project.  This phase must remain flexible to comply with the work restrictions imposed by the Hydraulic Projects Approval (HPA) permit.

The NAICS Code is 234990 with a size standard of $17 Million. This solicitation is open to all business concerns. The estimated price range for this project is between $5 million and $10 million dollars.  This acquisition will be competed under Source Selection procurement procedures in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3. The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government price and technical factors considered.

<DESC>The United States General Services Administration (GSA) invites industry, government, and academia to participate in an eAuthentication Technical Information Exchange Day concerning the Federal Government?s eAuthentication initiative.  As one of the 24- E-Government initiatives, an eAuthentication Gateway is a key component in the government?s program to improve efficiency and effectiveness through the use of improved technology.  The goals of the E-Government initiatives are to eliminate redundant systems and significantly improve the government?s quality of service for citizens and businesses. 

The future operational eAuthentication Gateway is envisioned as a service that will be provided to and through the FirstGov.gov portal.  It will provide authentication services to the other E-Government initiatives, allowing citizens, government entities, and their employees, businesses, and other institutions to conduct authenticated interactions.  It will also leverage and interoperate with existing credential management infrastructures, including components and services.  

The government is currently engaged in a prototype development effort that will focus on demonstrating feasibility, exploring technical agency and application interface issues, identifying various information policy issues, and developing a set of requirements to be used as part of a full and open competitive solicitation, planned for September 2002.

The eAuthentication Technical Information Exchange Day is on Friday, June 7, 2002, from 12:00 noon until 4:00 p.m. at Mitretek Systems Inc, 3150 Fairview Park Drive South Falls Church, VA  22040-4519.  Industry/government/academia are encouraged to participate in this exchange. 

Please RSVP by Wednesday, June 5, 2002, by sending an e-mail notice to eauthentication@mitretek.org containing name and citizenship.  Registration with Mitretek security and Picture ID are required upon arrival.  We welcome written technical comments and questions in advance and following the meeting.  Comments and questions can be forwarded to Stephen.timchak@gsa.gov and tice.deyoung@gsa.gov.

Directions to Mitretek can be found at:  http://www.mitretek.org.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Combat Support Systems, System Program Office at Eglin AFB, FL, seeks sources and information on methods and products to rapidly expand parking ramp space capable of supporting C-5, C-17, C-141, C-130 or F-15 aircraft at contingency/expeditionary airfields located anywhere in the world.  Methods for expanding aircraft parking areas may include the innovative use of chemicals, materials, and compounds for soil stabilization and/or the use of state-of-the-art, high-strength, lightweight matting.  There is an ever-increasing need to park transport aircraft to facilitate on- and off-loading of cargo and personnel.  Often, the forward operating locations have very limited, usable aircraft parking areas, due to age deterioration, their original construction/purpose, or due to damage caused during the contingency.  It is essential for the Air Force to have the capability to very rapidly repair/expand/create contingency airfield parking on any surface/soil type.  Potential suppliers should note that that the Government is looking for a system solution, rather than a simple replacement for AM-2 matting; however, if matting is included in the solution, the Government is looking for performance improvements such as lighter weight (not to exceed 3 pounds per square foot, if possible), no more than two-person lift required, not to exceed the thickness of the AM-2 mat, and low cost.  The Government wants to involve industry in the very early stages of this acquisition.  To initiate an exchange of information the Government requests that interested parties submit any or both of the following: (1) a paper, with conceptual sketches if applicable, that identifies potential/existing solutions or (2) product brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications/capabilities.  As part of your response, please include information on delivery/lead-time, warranty terms and conditions, and whether your product is commercially available.  Responses will be evaluated and a list of potential suppliers will be established containing those firms determined capable of fulfilling the Government?s requirements.  At a later date, the Government may acquire, one or more units for initial testing and a subsequent purchase of an unspecified number from one or more of these vendors.  This sources sought/request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any follow-on acquisitions. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this RFI.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  For further information concerning technical aspects contact Mr. Jon Simone, Program Engineer, or Lt. Jennifer Gould, Program Manager, AAC/WMO, 314 W. Choctawhatchee Ave, Suite 104, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5717, or by telephone at (850) 882-4684, extensions 317 and 321, respectively, e-mail addresses are: jon.simone@eglin.af.mil or jennifer.gould@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to upgrade or replace the containment booth currently used by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) to inspect incoming mail for bio-chemical contaminants.  This is an RFI only, and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services or product.  The Government will not pay for information received in response to this RFI, or for any costs incurred related to the submission of pricing information. There is no solicitation available at this time. 

BACKGROUND:  The DOC is currently using a temporary structure in which incoming mail is inspected for biological contaminants.  This is done in the basement of its headquarters building in Washington, DC,  where approximately 3,000 letters and/or small packages are inspected daily.  This temporary structure was constructed on an emergency basis after the Washington DC area experienced a biological attack in October 2001. The existing structure is approximately 8ft X 8 ft, and is located in a restricted access work area.  The total area available is approximately 10 ft X 32 Ft.   

The facility was intended to protect mailroom employees and building occupants by screening mail by physical examination to detect and contain possible release of any hazardous particulate contaminants.  The containment structure is serviced by a HEPA filter that also provides a  means for conducting routine bio-hazard testing. Samples of each mail delivery are then forwarded for laboratory analysis.  Mail is held for 48-72 hours until the results of these tests are provided to DOC.  While these  procedures provide safeguards, mail delivery is delayed and has become more costly.   

Requirement : The Department of Commerce is seeking a solution to provide long-term protection to employees and occupants from hazardous contaminants that could be dispersed through incoming mail.  Any solution must meet all regulations and guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, along with standard industrial hygiene ventilation commercial practices and standards for the control of airborne particles.  In addition, any recommended solution should recognize and be compatible with US Postal Service mail treatment and processing guidelines. The DOC is also interested in ways to detect and/or destroy hazardous biological spores or contaminants that may be present in trays of letter mail, small boxes or incoming mail.

NOTE: Mail handling Services at DOC are provided by a JWOD contractor who employs persons who may be disabled. The proposed solutions will need to address accessability and operability issues. 

The information submitted may include, but is not limited to, the frequency of the analysis, the method of obtaining samples for testing, methods of testing for harmful contaminants, methods of destroying chemical or biological contaminant4s, precautions to be taken when handling the mail, type (s) of protective equipment to be worn, and other such information.   Reducing mail delivery delays and bio-hazard protection costs are also goals of the Department of Commerce. 

A general solution, including a rough order of magnitude (ROM)  pricing is requested.  The pricing data should include warranties, maintenance, filters or other operating expenses, and testing, if part of the proposed solution, so that a total cost of use and ownership can be estimated.  Information on the submitting party?s relevant experience in the area of detection and containment of hazardous contaminants should be included in the RFI response. Include references with points of contact, if applicable.  Specific information should be limited to 10 pages.  Attachments including Annual Reports and brochures are welcome, but please limit enclosures to three items.  Reference material such as CDC policy may be included and will not count against the page limitations.   Please indicate if your productsor services are available on GSA schedule. Responses should be submitted by June 13, 2002.  Hard copies of material should be mailed to U.S. Department of Commerce, Commerce Acquisition Solutions, Room 6422, Attn: F. Krempa,  1401 Constitution Avenue NW,  Washington DC 20230.  Information may be forwarded electronically to fkrempa@doc.gov.    For additional information, contact the following DOC representative: Frank Krempa, Contracting Officer, by email at fkrempa@doc.gov

<SUBJECT>70 -- eAuthentication, E-Gov, FirstGov, Information Technology, Telecommunications
<DESC>The United States General Services Administration (GSA) invites industry, government, and academia to participate in an eAuthentication Technical Information Exchange Day concerning the Federal Government?s eAuthentication initiative.  As one of the 24- E-Government initiatives, an eAuthentication Gateway is a key component in the government?s program to improve efficiency and effectiveness through the use of improved technology.  The goals of the E-Government initiatives are to eliminate redundant systems and significantly improve the government?s quality of service for citizens and businesses. 

The future operational eAuthentication Gateway is envisioned as a service that will be provided to and through the FirstGov.gov portal.  It will provide authentication services to the other E-Government initiatives, allowing citizens, government entities, and their employees, businesses, and other institutions to conduct authenticated interactions.  It will also leverage and interoperate with existing credential management infrastructures, including components and services.  

The government is currently engaged in a prototype development effort that will focus on demonstrating feasibility, exploring technical agency and application interface issues, identifying various information policy issues, and developing a set of requirements to be used as part of a full and open competitive solicitation, planned for September 2002.

The eAuthentication Technical Information Exchange Day is on Friday, June 7, 2002, from 12:00 noon until 4:00 p.m. at Mitretek Systems Inc, 3150 Fairview Park Drive South Falls Church, VA  22040-4519.  Industry/government/academia are encouraged to participate in this exchange. 

Please RSVP by Wednesday, June 5, 2002, by sending an e-mail notice to eauthentication@mitretek.org containing name and citizenship.  Registration with Mitretek security and Picture ID are required upon arrival.  We welcome written technical comments and questions in advance and following the meeting.  Comments and questions can be forwarded to Stephen.timchak@gsa.gov and tice.deyoung@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Notice of intent to award a sole source requirment
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract to: Creative Consultants of Albuquerque, NM. This is not a Request for Quotation. The requirements are and have been delegated by the small business office at Kirtland AFB to award to the sole source standards provided in FAR 6.302. The justification for this award is that the computers that are being purchased for the White Sands Missile Range have very specific requirements. The computers currently use ISA card slots which are no longer in production. There is no possibility of switching from ISA slots due to the custom made equipment they are fitted for. After extensive research Creative Consultants is the only company able to fulfill the requirements. They are able to provide the capability of upgrading the old cards to newer custom-built cards at the convenience of the government. For specific questions please contact Nathaniel Craig, SrA @ (505) 846-4502 Email me at Nathaniel.Craig@Kirtland.af.mil. If you cannot reach me please contact my CO, Todd Annes, TSgt, at (505) 846-4673.

<SUBJECT>99 -- FPI''s Sales Ceilings for FY 2003
<DESC>The Board of Directors for Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) recently authorized FY 2003 production levels for seven products:  Systems Furniture, Office Seating, Office Case Goods, Work Clothing, Protective Clothing, Sweatshirts/Sweatpants and T-Shirts.

The FY 2003 sales ceiling for each of the seven products is based on their FY 2002 production ceilings previously set by FPI's Board of Directors.  Specifically, the Board took the FY 2002 sales ceilings, and adjusted each for inflation.  The inflation adjustment for FY 2003 is 3%.  This adjustment is consistent with FPI's guidelines and with previous Board actions.  The FY 2002 and FY 2003 sales ceilings for each product line are:

Systems Furniture:  FY 2002 - $137.9 million; FY 2003 - $142.1 million;

Office Seating:  FY 2002 - $113.3 million; FY 2003 - $116.7 million;

Office Case Goods:  FY 2002 - $72.1 million; FY 2003 - $74.3 million;

Work Clothing:  FY 2002 - $44.6 million; FY 2003 - $45.9 million;

Protective Clothing:  FY 2002 - $60.0 million; FY 2003 - $61.8 million;

Sweatshirts/Sweatpants:  FY 2002 - $15.1 million; FY 2003 - $15.6 million; and

T-Shirts:  FY 2002 - $14.7 million; FY 2003 - $15.1 million.

FPI believes these FY 2003 sales ceilings will allow the corporation to meet its inmate employment mandate by adjusting its sales to keep pace with rising costs, while not increasing its impact on private industry.

As discussed in FPI's industry involvement guidelines, any interested party has a right to raise a question at any time with FPI's Board of Directors.  All comments should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation and Corporate Support Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.
