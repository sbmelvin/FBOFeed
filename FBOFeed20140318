<DESC>To establish organizations within NATO for the future provisioning and support of equipment capabilities across the Alliance, the NATO Support Agency (NSPA) and the NATO Communications and Information Agency (the NCI Agency) have been reshaping internal processes, streamlining ways of working, and restructuring organizational elements. The agencies are seeking industry support in terms of a study that will clarify boundaries, roles, and responsibilities between the two agencies and provide an implementation roadmap. NSPA and the NCI Agency are procuring a tender for contract for a study into the CIS logistics support and governance arrangement between the agencies.
<p>A summary of the requirements is attached.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government will nominate to the bidders list only those firms that 1) have been approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) hold a current facility security clearance at the level of SECRET. In addition, for performance of the contract, contractor personnel will be required to hold a SECRET security clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NCI Agency the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the RFQ is RFQ-CO-13754-STDY and all correspondence concerning the RFQ should reference this number.</p>
<p>It is planned to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 21 March 2014<br /><br />- RFQ planned to be issued: 26 March 2014</p>
<p>- Informal bidders' conference tentatively scheduled for: 10 April 2014</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for: 17 April 2014</p>
<p>- Contract Award anticipated: 23 May 2014</p>

<DESC>Midget Faded Rattlesnake Modeling
The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Colorado State Office, Lakewood, Colorado has a requirement for Developing Predicitive Models for the Presence and Absence of Midget Faded Rattlesnakes (Crotalus organus concolor) Across their Range in Colorado.
General Work Description
Field work for this project, which was designed as a two-year study, was initiated in northwest Colorado in the summer of 2012 and is scheduled to conclude in 2014 (data was not collected during the 2013 field season).  Data collected during these two field seasons will allow to fine tune the models to be a very effective tool for predicting the probability of occurrence of midget faded rattlesnakes across their range in Colorado.  Staff will acquire GIS spatial layers of pertinent environmental variables (topography, climate, vegetation, etc.) across the midget faded rattlesnakes potential range in Colorado.  They will then develop models of hibernacula presence for Colorado using the Wyoming occurrence data and any available Colorado occurrences (including data collected from the 2012 field season) to predict the probability of occurrence in Colorado.  They will then validate those models with new data collected in Colorado.  Once all of the validation data has been collected, the final validated models will be submitted  to the BLM and training provided in their use for predicting the probability of occurrence of midget faded rattlesnake dens on a very fine scale across their range in Colorado.  
The requirement above will be satisfied through a sole source 8(a) purchase.
For questions please contact Felicia Salazar at fsalazar@blm.gov.

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil. E-mailed proposals cannot exceed 15MB.</p>

<DESC>Eligible Applicants <P> Public Law 102-588, passed in 1992, authorized NASA to initiate NASA EPSCoR to strengthen the research capability of jurisdictions that have not in the past participated equably in competitive aerospace research activities. The goal of NASA EPSCoR is to provide seed funding that will enable jurisdictions to develop an academic research enterprise directed toward long-term, self-sustaining, nationally-competitive capabilities in aerospace and aerospace-related research. This capability will, in turn, contribute to the jurisdiction's economic viability and expand the nation's base for aerospace research and development. <P> Based on the availability of funding, NASA will continue to help jurisdictions achieve these goals through NASA EPSCoR. Funded jurisdictions will be selected through a merit-based, peer-review competition. <P> The following are the specific objectives of NASA EPSCoR: <P> Contribute to and promote the development of research capability in NASA   EPSCoR jurisdictions in areas of strategic importance to the NASA mission; <P> Improve the capabilities of the NASA EPSCoR jurisdictions to gain support from sources outside the NASA EPSCoR program; <P> Develop partnerships among NASA research assets, academic institutions, and industry; <P> Contribute to the overall research infrastructure, science and technology capabilities, higher education, and economic development of the jurisdiction; and <P> Work in close coordination with the Space Grant consortium in the jurisdiction to improve the environment for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. <P> While proposals can be accepted only from institutions for which the NASA EPSCoR Directors are currently serving, all institutions of higher education within the jurisdiction should be given the opportunity and be made aware of the FY 2014 NASA EPSCoR CAN. <P> The National Science Foundation (NSF) determines overall jurisdiction eligibility for NASA EPSCoR. Details regarding general eligibility are available at: <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/epscor/eligible.jsp">http://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/p rograms/epscor/eligible.jsp </A>     . <P> The following jurisdictions are eligible to submit one proposal to this NASA EPSCoR solicitation: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. <P> South Carolina may submit up to two proposals, provided at least one of the proposals represents a project from the U.S. Virgin Islands (which currently falls under South Carolinas jurisdiction). <P> Agency Name 	   NASA Headquarters <P> Description <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Education, in cooperation with NASAs Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD), Human Exploration & Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), Science Mission Directorates (SMD), the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), and NASAs ten centers, solicits proposals for the NASA Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Each funded NASA EPSCoR proposal is expected to establish research activities that will make significant contributions to NASAs strategic research and technology development priorities and contribute to the overall research infrastructure, science and technology capabilities, higher education, and economic development of the jurisdiction. The program parameters are: <P> NASA EPSCoR Jurisdictions responding to this Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) may submit one proposal per paragraph 1.3 below (EPSCoR Eligibility and Proposal Acceptance). <P> The maximum funding request per proposal is $750,000. This amount is to be expended over a three-year period. <P> All NASA EPSCoR monies must be cost-shared at a level of at least 50% with non-federal monies. In-kind cost-sharing is allowable. <P> This CAN is available in electronic form through the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) and through Grants.gov. <P> To access the CAN through NSPIRES, go to <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com">http://nspires.nasaprs.com </A>     and click on Solicitations. <P> To access the CAN through Grants.gov, go to <A HREF="http://www.grants.gov/search/agency.do">http://www.grants.gov/search/agency.do </A>    and select the link for NASA.

<CONTACT>Joseph Riccomini
<DESC>Notice of Intent  to Award Sole Source: The Department of the Interior, United States Geological Survey intends to award a sole source purchase order (under the provisions of FAR 13.106-1{b)), to the Los Angeles Regional Imagery Consortium (LAR-IAC) of Los Angeles County, CA for imagery to be acquired by LAR-IAC as described below.

The USGS National Geospatial Program (NGP) has a cyclical need for high resolution orthoimagery in various locations nationwide to support of The National Map, natural resource management needs, coordinated emergency and disaster response needs, as well as additional needs of various other federal, state and local agencies. Since the existing imagery for the Los Angeles, CA area has become dated, more recent replacement imagery (which is suitable and commonly  shared) has been identified as a need for the USGS as well as other federal, state, and local stakeholders.

The Los Angeles Regional Imagery Consortium (LAR-IAC)is the designated coordinating body for the collection, sharing and dissemination  of orthoimagery to state, county and city government for Los Angeles County.   LAR-IAC has previously completed  multiple successful orthoimagery collections  on a 2 to 3 year collection interval, and USGS has been a partner  with LAR-IAC in many of those previous  projects.  In this regard, the USGS has benefited from both the multiagency  data sharing infrastructures developed, as well as associated cost savings resulting from the cost sharing approach.

For the current cycle, the estimated/potential $100,000 planned USGS purchase order amounts to a contribution of approximately 1/3rd of the estimated  final cost of delivering this year's updated collection product. The remaining 2/3rds cost of the data collection activity are to be absorbed by LAR-IAC and/or its partners.  The LAR-IAC partnership process involves a multiagency agreement  on standards, specifications, and data sharing that ensures common data and standards use by all levels of government doing business in the Los Angeles County  area. This eliminates discrepancies and errors that typically  occur when multiple data sources are used by multiple agencies and translates to considerable cost savings. Due to the joint/shared funding of this project by the parties involved, a sole source award to LAR-IAC for the completed  data acquired by their project  is considered to be in the best interests of the government, as it yields a significant cost savings to the USGS (estimated  67% savings) over the cost of a similar effort funded entirely  by the agency.  A sole source award is planned under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; accordingly a competitive solicitation will not be published  or released under this requirement. No solicitation is planned to be issued, and this may be the only noticed  published  by the agency regarding this proposed acquisition. Questions or comments  regarding this proposed  award may be directed to the buyer via email at jriccomini@usgs.gov.

Whalen Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) 500 Foothill Blvd., Salt lake City, Utah 84148. This project will include both new construction and renovation.  The new construction of approximately 2,600 sq. ft. will be located adjacent to an existing building structure to support the identified "Polytrauma Amputation Network Site" and associated Prosthetics Lab administrative support.  Interior renovation of vacated rehabilitation space (approx. 3,700 sq. ft.) will support the needed Prosthetics Lab due to its adjacency to established Prosthetic Storage and Rehabilitation Clinical space.  Between the new and renovation space the total square footage in project is 6,300 sq. ft.  These new functions will permit interlacing with existing rehab and clinic programs.  The project is in an area of the campus surrounded by all of the support utilities necessary for the structure's operation.  The construction will be designed in accordance with the sustainability, energy, security and seismic requirements applied to the VA Medical Center construction.  Design must incorporate emergency power to support ongoing utility operation due to function of this space.  A/E is responsible for investigating all existing conditions including performing geotechnical surveys and locating and analyzing utilities including determining adequacy of utility capacity.  This includes identifying options for new utility (required by the design) pathway routing on site and within the building.  If utility capacity is determined insufficient for new construction, A/E is responsible for incorporating all utility upgrades in design

The design must, as a minimum, be in accordance with all applicable codes indicated in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Space Criteria, Space Equipment Planning System (SEPS), Design Manuals and VA PUBLICATIONS (Master Construction Specifications, Construction Standards, etc.).

Design is to follow all information outlined in VA Technical Information Library located at http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/dGuide.asp  unless otherwise approved in writing by VA.  Please note: The VA is its own Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) and is, therefore, not necessarily required to comply with the requirements of other AHJs with which the A/E firm may have worked.   Work includes, but is not limited to, Architectural, Mechanical and Electrical design services for the Gait and Prosthetics Lab Addition including but not limited to: (1) field investigation of existing site and building conditions and utility (including capacities) needs of existing building systems; (2) field verification of available record information (as-built drawings, etc.) for accuracy and omissions; (3) interview and work with VAMC staff to determine the best arrangement of the Gait and Prosthetics Lab addition and associated systems to improve functionality, accommodate modern equipment and improve overall workflow.

The project design shall meet the Guiding Principles for Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings (Guiding Principles) and all energy/water/environmental requirements established by Environmental Protection Act (EPACT) 2005, Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) 2007, Executive Orders (Eos) 13514 and 13423, and VA Directive 0055.  This design (including major mechanical equipment) will require energy modeling (annual building or zone simulation based on local weather data), and analysis during planning and all phases of design to achieve the energy budgets required in the above laws.  The typical design analysis will include a Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) on three different alternatives.  

A/E is to apply for Storm Water Permit through Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) and maintain all Storm Water paperwork as required by permit as well as perform checks of construction for compliance with permit through duration of construction as part of construction period services.

The new building shall meet the latest federal requirements for energy efficiency.  VA-owned facilities are required to meet, at a minimum, the energy standard prescribed in American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2010. Further, these facilities are required to achieve an energy consumption level of at least 30 percent below ASHRAE Standard, if that level is attainable without a resulting increase in life-cycle cost; or, if 30 percent below the ASHRAE Standard is unattainable, the maximum level that can be attained without a resulting increase in life-cycle cost. The buildings shall be designed so that the fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the buildings is reduced.

The physical security standards also apply to the space being renovated in an existing building. When establishing a design and associated cost estimation budget for this mission critical project, the key point is that physical security is fully integrated into the program, rather than an added requirement.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 660-CSI-105- Gait Lab Addition to B.08 projected at the George E. Whalen Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) located at 500 Foothill Blvd., Salt lake City, Utah 84148. This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business Set-aside. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL 

The George E. Whalen Veterans Affair Medical Center (VAMC) 500 Foothills Blvd., Salt lake City, Utah 84148 is seeking a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business to provide all materials, labor, tools, supervision, systems, etc. necessary for VA Project 660-CSI-105 in constructing clinical spaces (a Gait Lab Complex Addition to B.08) for gait analysis for young prosthesis evaluation associated with veteran's walking and running.  The project area will include all of the communication networking associated with the operation and monitoring of 15 to 20 cameras.  Project work will also entail all necessary utility work associated with the operation of the gait lab, specialized flooring and vibration isolation in accordance with adjoining Medical Center rehabilitation facilities. The Gait Lab is required to support a new osseo-integration prosthesis activity incorporated into the Rehabilitation Program at the Medical Center.  Due to the expanded rehabilitation workload experienced by the support requirements for the OIF/OEF Veteran population, the prosthesis support programs been required to expand in size and technology.  The lab is necessary to conduct analysis, evaluations and patient treatment associated with the implementation and application of the prosthesis devices for the Veterans being served.  Without such a lab, patients receiving the benefits of this prosthesis activity would be required to travel great distances for these evaluations apart from their physical therapy treatment team and physicians.  This project will require construction expertise for general construction, mechanical and electrical work, necessary removal of existing construction and certain other items in the installation of building components and service equipment involving various skilled trades (e.g., Laborers, Cement Finishers, Project Superintendents, Additional Construction Administrative Services, etc.).   Performance Period is 270-calendar days from issuance of a Notice to Proceed.

   
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL WILL BE POSTED ON OR ABOUT 21 APRIL 2014. 

The POC for this project will be Robert Moreno.  He can be contacted at (307)-433-3728 or by email at Robert.Moreno3@va.gov

We estimate that for some regions in the user country, the distances between EW elements (ES, EA, and EWOC) will be more than 30 Km which makes it difficult to secure connectivity with each other, a fixed-site radio towers configuration must be proposed to provide extended range communications for a single company. <br> 4.3.2.2.	Each HCLOS radio tower consists of two radios, two amplifiers, one Omni antenna, one directional antenna and a relay unit. The user country will provide the towers and power for the radio equipment, Figure 1 depicts an example tower configuration. The configuration shall require 4 radios, i.e. 2 per tower. <br>   <br> Figure 1.  HCLOS Communications Network <br>  <br> 4.3.3.	Existing IP-Based Network Infrastructure <br> 4.3.3.1.	The EWOC shall have an IP interface to be directly connected to the existing IP network or through a router. <br> 4.3.3.2.	The LAN at the CO EWOC and the LAN at the fixed site can be connected through a router. Traffic from/to both LANs can be routed between each other. <br> 4.3.3.3.	The user country owns a wide coverage TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) communications network. It is preferable that all EW sub-systems be TETRA-enabled to supplement other communications when operating within coverage areas. This arrangement may require interference cancellation mechanism. <br>  <br> US Army Communications- Electronics Command, CECOM Acquisition Center - DAAB07, ATTN: AMSEL-AC, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005

<DESC>Synopsis: <br>  <br> This is a Sources Sought Notice ONLY. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not receive a response. The Joint Project Manager, Protection (JPM P) is issuing this sources sought announcement as part of a market survey to establish a baseline of knowledge within industry relative to the technical maturity and availability of Chemical and Biological (CB) protective respirators for use in all variants of the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) that will provide combined protection for CB and gravity induced loss of consciousness (GLOC) when integrated with the anti-G system. The JPM P wishes to identify potential sources that may possess the product required to meet the requirements of the Joint Service Aircrew Mask for Joint Strike Fighter (JSAM-JSF). <br>  <br> Background: The JSAM-JSF is defined as a system for individual pilots above the neck percutaneous, ocular, and respiratory protection against CB warfare agents. When integrated with aircraft-mounted breathing equipment, the system will provide combined (simultaneous as required) hypoxia, CB, and anti-G protection. The JSAM-JSF will be a lightweight, protective respirator system that integrates with the F-35 Life Support System and the Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) systems and below the neck CB protective ensemble.  The JSAM-JSF shall incorporate state of the art technology to protect aviation forces from anticipated threats during flight, ground transit and preflight/post-flight aircraft related activities. <br>  <br> The JSAM-JSF system requirements include in part: <br>  <br> [1] The system shall prevent chemical agent permeation (liquid, aerosol and vapor) for a period of 16 hours. <br> [2] The blown (positive air pressure) system shall provide a Quantitative Fit Factor (QFF) of 100,000 for the F-35 population against biological agents. <br>  <br> [3] The system shall include filtration which provides CB protection when integrated with all elements of the JSAM-JSF system and the aircraft-mounted and pilot-mounted systems.  This covers standard flight, ground walkout/transit and ground emergency egress scenarios. <br>  <br> [4] The JSAM-JSF shall provide an effective mask seal up to 60 mm Hg pressure breathing at G loads up to +9Gz for 15 seconds with a +6Gz per second onset rate when integrated with a pressure breathing for G (PBG) system. <br> [5] The decompression-derived pressure spike in the mask cavity shall not exceed 45mm Hg gauge {41mm Hg gauge} during a decompression in the absence of a chest counter pressure vest.   <br>  <br> [6] The system must be able to survive an ejection with windblast up to 600 KEAS and not injure the pilot. <br>  <br> [7] The critical viewing area (optical surface) shall have no distortion which would impact safety of flight or prevent normal and emergency operations. <br>  <br> [8] The system shall require no aircraft modifications and shall integrate with existing pilot flight equipment, helmet mounted displays, pilot seating and aircraft oxygen connections. <br>  <br> [9] The system shall prevent mist/frost buildup on system optical surfaces during normal and emergency operations such that pilots can accomplish their operational duties.  This shall be accomplished without the use of any topical anti-fog compounds by the user.  <br>  <br> [10] The system shall permit the wearer to perform a one-handed valsalva (equalization of inner ear pressure via pinching of the nose) maneuver without breaking the CB seal.  This shall be accomplished while the pilot is wearing JSF flight gloves and CB protective gloves. <br>  <br> [11] The system when integrated with existing head-mounted personal/life support equipment shall no degrade hearing protection compared to the non-CB configuration. <br>  <br>  <br> Vendors that can provide an existing product or a modified product that meets or exceeds the above requirements are invited to submit the following information in a capability statement: 1) product summary, 2) complete description of technical characteristics, capabilities and product maturity, and 3) photographs, diagrams, drawings and descriptions of proposed technologies. Vendors shall also indicate if commercially developed/non-developmental items or components may be used or proposed. Vendors are requested to submit their Capability Statement to the point of contact noted below. <br>  <br> This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government for follow-on-acquisition. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice, or otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement or payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this Notice and Government use of such information.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time. All qualified interested sources may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the capability of offerors in performing this type of work. The capability statements will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, if a certain socio-economic set-aside strategy is warranted. The Government DOES NOT intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services. The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541511 is $25.5 million.  <br>  <br> The Mission and Installation Contracting Command-Fort Hood (MICC-FH) has a requirement for Extensible, Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence Instrumentation System (ExCIS) Fire Support Application (FSA) hardware and software maintenance and development/upgrade. In performing required services, the Contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, and supervision. <br>  <br> The ExCIS FSA provides the Fires Test Directorate (FTD) with the instrumentation system that performs the required functions for planning, executing, and analyzing test events using digital fire support Mission Command (MC) systems.  The FTD of the Operational Test Command (OTC), at Fort Sill, OK, serves as the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) lead for management and deployment of ExCIS for developmental and operational testing, training, and experimentation uses. Continued enhancements to ExCIS FSA are required in order to meet the dynamic training needs. <br>  <br> The ExCIS hardware and software maintenance and development is required for the design, engineering development, integration with current and future Army simulations and other test evaluation technologies via Advanced Test and Evaluation (T&E) Enterprise Architecture (ATEA). Specific functionality supported includes tactical systems and network integration and emulation, tactical network data collection, data management (reduction, analysis, visualization), distributed simulation and behavioral modeling, and domain expertise in field artillery / fire support systems and operation to include Army tactical planning tools.  This effort primarily consists of the continuing development and upgrade of the ExCIS Fire Support Application (FSA) capabilities for test planning, test driver, simulation-stimulation, data collection, and data reduction of current and future U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) field artillery (FA) and fire support (FS) systems using the legacy Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems (FATDS) and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) devices and operational facilities (OPFACs) from forward observer to corps FA sections (to include fire support elements/fires and effects cells (FSEs/FECs) and fire direction centers (FDCs) at corps, division, brigade, battalion, battery, and platoon levels, and Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), cannon, mortar, Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Firefinder radar systems, and meteorological measuring system (MMS)). Key additional tasks will include sustainment and evolution of ExCIS FSA as a key part of the ATEA, support to other Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) test efforts, support to the Army's Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) training federations, and support to, when requested, other Army, Defense Department and international alliance activities. <br>  <br> The capability statement (not to exceed 10 pages) shall demonstrate the company's capability describing previous recent and relevant procurements performed of similar size and complexity to provide development and deployment of large-scale, real-time, distributed software and hardware engineering experience involving multi-functional, integrated systems-of-systems solutions.  Experience must include the development of the above mentioned capabilities as well as the deployment (user training, reach back support, event support) and implementation of the above mentioned capabilities in field environments. Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name, address, business size and type (8(a), HubZone, Small Business, etc), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number. Also, interested sources are requested to provide in their capability statement a description of their capability and expertise to perform the services outlined in this announcement, specifically demonstrating competency in all areas below: <br>  <br> a) Army mission command and network-centric tactical systems integration and emulation experience, with a particular emphasis on DoD fire support capabilities  (weapons, advanced munitions, command and control systems, target acquisition) and the networks, tactics, techniques, and procedures.  Specifically address capabilities to accurately transmit, receive, and correctly act on messages using the required DoD Interface Standards for communications protocols (MIL-STD-188-220C and MIL-STD-2045-47001C) to include the required message formats in FATDS Package 11, AFATDS Variable Message Format (VMF), and Joint VMF (JVMF) Revision 3/5/6017/6017a/6017b/6017c over multiple tactical communications systems to simulate-stimulate the legacy and AFATDS OPFACs. <br>  <br> b) Collect network and over the air data from military communications systems employing a variety of tactical message exchange protocols and formats with particular emphasis on AFATDS system-to-system native message formats (also called request objects (RO); Note: specifications for these AFATDS to AFATDS exchanges are treated as proprietary information by the AFATDS government program office and their prime contractor and are shared with OTC and its ExCIS support team via a strict sharing agreement that limits access to US-only simulation and data collection test support applications.  Performers under this contract will be required to acknowledge and fully implement that data sharing and protection agreement).  Data collection capability to unobtrusively monitor, collect, and archive data being transmitted between multiple live and/or simulated OPFACs over multiple communications nets using all the communications protocols described above. <br>  <br> c) Real-time simulation and emulation capabilities, with particular focus on stimulating tactical fire support systems. Test driver capability to inject predetermined inputs/messages and mission files between the test driver system and the specified legacy and AFATDS OPFACs based on both automated and manual time-ordered events list (TOEL) inputs.  The contractor shall also provide development and integration support in the area of current and future operational environments. <br>  <br> d) Test planning tools and processes. The capability to fully and completely define the test or event lay down for all live and simulated OPFACs, the net structure and protocols for all communications nets, the simulation-stimulation lay down for each node, and the data collection structure for the event. <br>  <br> e) Data Reduction, analysis and visualization capabilities. Data reduction capability to correctly and accurately translate and expand all collected data and transmissions from archived files by aggregating, sorting, comparing, and/or grouping the data into predetermined summaries, frequencies, tables, and reports based on any elements of the individual transmissions, to include elements of the transmission protocol using non-proprietary software to produce a single relational database containing all of the elements of the individual transmissions. <br>  <br> Should you be interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Mr. Mark Ramey/Ms. Belinda Woods at the email addresses listed below. Packages are to be submitted no later than April 2, 2014, 2:00 PM Central Standard Time. Also, MICC-FH welcomes any comments from interested sources. <br>  <br> All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Mr. Mark Ramey, Contract Specialist, and Ms. Belinda Woods, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at mark.a.ramey10.civ@mail.mil and belinda.woods.civ@mail.mil.  <br>

<SUBJECT>Other Health Insurance (OHI) Discovery
<SOLNBR>HT0003-14-RFI-0030
<RESPDATE>032714
<CONTACT>Nicolas Sanchez, Email nicolas.sanchez@dha.mil
<DESC>**no questions will be accepted for this RFI**
<p>1.0	Purpose of this RFI<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is to identify potential sources of services for Other Health Insurance (OHI) discovery in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) Military Healthcare System.  Responses to this RFI will be used to assess the capability of business interests in various socioeconomic categories to perform this work.</p>
<p>2.0	Background</p>
<p>The DoD records commercial other health insurance (OHI) in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).  When complete, this information identifies treatment for which TRICARE is a secondary payer to any applicable third party insurance.  It also allows military treatment facilities (MTFs) operated by the Uniformed Services bill to and collect from commercial insurance companies for medical treatment provided to non-active duty service member beneficiaries.  Studies indicate that a significantpercentage of records in DEERS lack complete or accurate OHI.  DoD is currently conducting small-scale pilot programs in MTF benefit recovery that include OHI discovery as part of the process.  The Defense Health Agency intends to award a contract focused primarily on proactive OHI discovery to support the existing billing and collection processes for healthcare services provided by the MTFs and purchased from TRICARE providers.  The intended concept is to provide the performer with a data file sourced from DEERS and containing identities and OHI information for some number of TRICARE beneficiaries.  The performer will search for updated OHI information, verify it with a commercial health insurer or employer, and return a data file containing updated OHI information.  The expected terms of the contract will include a fixed-price payment for each record containing new or updated OHI information that has been verified with the insurer and can be loaded back into DEERS within a set number of days.</p>
<p><br />3.0	Required Capabilities <br />Respondents shall provide company information.  At a minimum, this should include business name, business address, name of company representative, contact information, and business qualification for socio-economic categories (e.g., Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Business, Women-owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, etc.)</p>
<p>Respondents shall identify expected teaming arrangements with other business interests and the percentage of work to be performed by each.  For team members, identify business name, business address, and business qualification for socio-economic categories (e.g., Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Business, Women-owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, etc.)</p>
<p>Respondents shall describe their overall ability to perform discovery of new OHI information to include but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>a)	Ability to identify and validate billable health insurance for Uniformed Services beneficiaries that have no health insurance information on file as well as identify and validate other health insurance information that may have policy information missing and provide said information to update the OHI repository in the DEERS database.</p>
<p>b)	Ability to establish and maintain a productive cost-effective Insurance ID system; incorporate industry standard performance metrics; monitor and validate the accuracy, and timeliness of DEERS OHI information; and establish a reporting mechanism that measures return on investment that is in line with negotiated performance metrics.</p>
<p>c)	Ability to query commercial health insurance carriers to include Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna, Mailhandlers, United, and other OHI providers as well as pharmaceutical insurance providers.  Identify current access to or the anticipated time to enter into Data Sharing Agreements with commercial health insurance carriers. Describe any business-owned OHI search engine(s)</p>
<p>d)	Ability to store, safeguard, and safely transmit all personal identifying information and protected health insurance data.</p>
<p>4.0 	How to Respond <br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  The formal closing date for this RFI and for the submission of responses is March 27, 2014. All responses should be submitted electronically using PDF, HTML, MS Word or PowerPoint formats with subject "Identification and Validation of Other Health Insurance" to the following Email addresses:  nicolas.sanchez@dha.mil <br />*Total e-mail file limit size is restricted to 5MB. Files exceeding this threshold shall be submitted over multiple messages, and be identified as "Message #x of #x".</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ). NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.<br /><br />
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services with a small business size standard of $14 million.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a Market Survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below:</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Health literacy has become a well-established area of study. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has a health literacy working group that coordinates NLM's work with similar working groups administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) also has an active health literacy interest group among its membership.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed, a one-stop (Internet-based) location, will create an arena where researchers can obtain many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve the methodological quality of health literacy research. The Health Literacy Tool Shed represents a service that provides outreach to health literacy professionals. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to find many of the available constructs and quantitative tools used to measure health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research. Although the project's beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the project is designed to create a needed educational resource.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will organize constructs, measures, and instruments that are currently scattered across an array of health literacy research. There is no current resource where practitioners and researchers can consult what health literacy measurement measures, constructs, and instruments are best suited to a planned project. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information on health literacy assessment instruments, this foundational gap inhibits the field's development as a coherent body of knowledge and practice. The end of methodological fragmentation in the health literacy field (and the availability of a website to find the best instruments for specific projects) also will assist NLM's future health literacy research and help make NLM a leader in health literacy research and practice.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be unique educational resource. While this type of resource often is touted by health literacy researchers and practitioners, currently it does not exist nor is a similar resource under construction or consideration elsewhere.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance shall be a 12-month base period with (1) additional 12-month option period. The proposed contract type will be firm fixed price.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective</p>
<p>This Health Literacy Tool Shed educational and outreach project creates a unique resource center to support health literacy researchers and enhance the quality of national and international health literacy research. While the project's beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the current project creates an educational resource that provides outreach to a research community as well as a topic of interest to the NLM.</p>
<p>The project will create a one-stop website, where researchers can assess many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve health literacy research. The proposed Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will provide a vital outreach service for the health literacy research community. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to identify and assess many of the available constructs and quantitative measures used to assess health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research in one, accessible location.</p>
<p>Although dozens of health literacy measurement tools have been introduced and the literature has proliferated, a core problem in health literacy outreach and intervention efforts is the uneven quality of methods used by health literacy assessment teams and a confusing array of constructs, measures, and instruments. Some examples of the current methodological confusion and fragmentation in health literacy research is found in Appendix A, which suggests there are at least 15 separate measures based on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy. Appendix A also notes there are nine different measures based in the Test of Functional Health Literacy (TOFHLA) as well as many other constructs and measures of aspects of health literacy.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread availability of health literacy measurement tools, criticisms from independent reviewers reflect that health literacy research methodological flaws may stem from a lack of infrastructure to support health literacy researchers and practitioners. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information about health literacy assessment constructs, measures, and instruments, the gap impedes the health literacy field's development into a more coherent body of knowledge and practice. <br /><br />The Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will create for the first time: 1) access to health literacy assessment tools; 2) a health literacy tool selection process for investigators; 3) an overview of researcher adherence to various health literacy instruments; and, 4) background information about a construct/measure's validity or empirical validation.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be a virtual indexing system for health literacy methods with specific information on the following:</p>
<p>&#9679; Administration instructions (how long it takes to administer, number of questions, languages, method of administration, etc.)</p>
<p>&#9679; Constructs measured (i.e. numeracy, word pronunciation, problem solving, general health maintenance, etc.)</p>
<p>&#9679; Links to the instruments (or information on how to obtain the instrument when the Contractor has not secured permission to post the instrument) and to validation articles</p>
<p>&#9679; Expert commentary on strengths and limitations and on how to select instruments in various research and practice contexts.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed also could identify some gaps in the current array of health literacy instruments and provide a venue for users to discuss the development of further health literacy research assessment tools. In addition, the Health Literacy Tool Shed provides an excellent complement to NLM's Consumer Health Informatics Research Resource (chirr.nlm.nih.gov), which provides general information about common constructs used in consumer health informatics assessment, including health literacy.</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria</p>
<p>1) The Contractor must possess extensive academic knowledge and expertise in the field of health literacy research and extensive experience in health literacy practice in both health care delivery and public health.<br />2) The Contractor must display a track record of national and international leadership in evaluating health literacy research.<br />3) The Contractor's subject matter experts (health literacy researchers and practitioners) must possess a Ph.D. or M.D. degree and publish regularly in a refereed academic journal.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services needed to complete this project. All work performed under this procurement shall be monitored by the NLM Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>General Contractor Tasks</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide an education resource that encompasses many of the existing research measures, constructs, and instruments listed in Appendix A. The Contractor shall create a website that provides interactive guidance to enhance the use of health literacy research constructs, measures, and instruments.

<p>Background</p>
<p>NOAA Fisheries Service is dedicated to protecting and preserving our nation's living marine <br />resources and their habitat through scientific research, management and enforcement.<br />The primary mission of the Howard Laboratory is to conduct research in ecology, leading to a better understanding of both coastal and estuarine organisms and the effects of human activities on nearshore marine populations.</p>
<p>The organic chemistry laboratory research focuses on a wide range of research topics related to the health and well-being of marine resource species, and the extent to which environmental conditions such as chemical contaminants affect the sustainability and utilization. Studies are conducted on the analyses of trace levels of organic contaminants in water, sediment, and tissues of fishes and invertebrates with an emphasis on developing novel, rapid and cost-effective detection techniques. The chemistry data sets are used to determine the temporal and spatial trends, and how the contaminants accumulate and are distributed in nearshore and estuarine systems and through food web transfer. The contaminants and other biochemicals such as fatty acid methyl esters are also tested as intrinsic natural tags to understand the habitat use, migration patterns, and feeding ecology of managed and recreational species such as: bluefish, striped bass, bluefin tuna and lobster.<br /> <br />Gas Chromatograph Specifications  <br />Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (GC-Triple Quad MS/MS) System with Negative Chemical Ionization (NCI) and Positive Chemical Ionization (PCI) <br />1.

<DESC><p><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are seeking sources capable of performing the requirements necessary to maintain the observatory. The northern tropical atmospheric research station at Ragged Point, Barbados (RPB) is located on the eastern edge of the island with direct exposure to the Atlantic Ocean. It is located in the parish of Saint Phillip, about 1 km (0.6 mile) NNE of the village of Sealy Hall with geographical coordinates, latitude of 13.1650 N, longitude 59.432 W, and mean altitude above sea level (masl) of 15 meters (~49.5 ft). It experiences generally easterly winds disrupted routinely by the passage of cyclones and anticyclones.  The Ragged Point, Barbados station is an important site by providing an opportunity to observe and monitor both regional and global influences, because of the unique characteristics of a relatively remote coastal location.  It also provides an important link of northern hemispheric Atlantic Ocean stations to those of NOAA's Pacific Ocean stations for comparison in international assessments of stratospheric ozone depletion, climate forcing, and air quality. To maintain the observatory facility and instrumentation year round; site must be staffed at least 5 days a week to verify instrumentation, security, calibrations, and maintenance.  The mission is to acquire, evaluate and make available accurate, long-term records of atmospheric gases in a manner that allows the causes of the change to be understood.</p>
<p>The Advanced Global Atmospheric Gas Experiment (AGAGE, formerly called ALE and GAGE) has operated continuously at this location since 1978.  There are two in-situ instruments, dedicated trailer/laboratory, concrete slab, phone and internet connections there. The gas chromatograph-multi-detector (GC-MD) instrument started measuring atmospheric chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11), CFC-12, methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in 1978, CFC-113 in 1985, and methane (CH4) and chloroform (CHCl3) in 1996. A state of the art Medusa gas chromatograph-mass selective detector (GC-MS) instrument, with capability of measuring more than 40 trace gases, was installed in May 2005.  After 17 years of operation, a rusted trailer/laboratory was removed in July 2013, and a new laboratory was installed shortly afterward. The location is  Ragged Point, Barbados Station<br />Sealy Hall, Saint Phillip Parrish, Barbados.</p>
<p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:<br />The instrument suite is highly specialized and requires a skilled technician to operate.  The government does not provide training on the instrumentation. Vehicle access to Ragged Point, Barbados is gated and the University of Bristol issues the key. Vehicle access is required by the contractor to meet the NOAA mission at Ragged Point, Babardos. NOAA cannot grant access for the completion of the work and the contractor is responsible for securing access separately. Access will be verified during the evaluation of the proposals. The government does not provide any equipment or laboratory. That is the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>WORK TO BE PERFORMED<br />Maintain the observatory facility and instrumentation year round; site must be staffed 5 days a week to verify instrumentation, security, calibrations, and maintenance.</p>
<p>Facility maintenance includes, but not limited to, general upkeep and rust mitigation for the AGAGE trailer and tower.</p>
<p>Instrument operations include:</p>
<p>1.GC-MD instrument<br />&bull;AGAGE uses gas chromatography (GC) with electron-capture detection (ECD), flame-ionization detection detection (FID), and mercuric oxide reduction detection (MRD) to measure five biogenic/anthropogenic gases.  This instrument requires periodic maintenance (changing of carrier and calibration gases at least once a month), visual observation, checklists, and evaluation of data.  <br />2.GC-MS instrument <br />&bull;AGAGE uses gas chromatography (GC) with a mass selective detection, also called a mass spectrometric detector.   This instrument requires periodic maintenance (changing of carrier and calibration gases at least once a month), visual observation, checklists, and evaluation of data.  See Table 1 for gases currently measured.<br />3.Physical laboratory upkeep.  Air conditioning filter changes, phone and internet line maintenance and testing.<br />4.Logistical support/supplies for other episodic sampling campaigns conducted by NOAA as well as non-NOAA entities (partners).</p>
<p>The Government is especially interested in responses from SBA certified small business concerns that are capable of performing the work described within this notice.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all supervision, material, and labor necessary to maintain the observatory. The anticipated period of performance is a one-year base period with four-one year option periods.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990, Professional, Scientific and Technical Services and the small-business size standard is $14.0.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a fixed-price service contract.</p>
<p>This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. Nor does this request for information constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that any procurement action that may be issued for the Government's requirements related to this work.</p>
<p>No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of the contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Please submit information to include:</p>
<p>1) Your firm's DUNS number &amp; CAGE code;<br />2) Your firm's SBA certified small business concern status. Specifically identify if your firm is HUBZone-certified, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or SBA 8(a) program certified;<br />3) A brief description of your firm's recent past experience (within past 3 years) performing complex similar work as described above;<br />4) Identify from the list of major work components above those that your firm would likely subcontract out. Any subsequent contract will contain the mandatory FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, which limits subcontracting costs to 50% of the price of the contract.</p>
<p>Information must be received by the Contract Specialist, Mr. Mark Caban, at mark.caban@noaa.gov by close-of-business on Friday, April 4, 2014.  Do not call regarding this sources sought notice.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is conducting market research/sources sought to identify responsible sources and obtain information to purchase renewable power at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Miramar located in San Diego, California.  

The Marine Corps desires to purchase energy generated from renewable power generation system(s) developed, constructed and owned by a private entity or entities.  The intent of the Marine Corps is to enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).

The requirement is for approximately 13,900 MWh of bundled renewable energy on an annual basis.
  The renewable energy must be delivered continuously 24 hours a day for the term of the contract.  Due to future mircrogrid implementation, the point of connection to MCAS must be a direct connection - separate from the external distribution and transmission systems of the commercial utility.   The anticipated capacity of the generation source is 1.7MW.   
  
The provider of this PPA will be responsible for all interconnection requirements as per San Diego Gas & Electric (SDGE) Rule 21 for a direct connection to MCASs electrical grid. The Marine Corps requirement is to purchase the renewable attributes associated with this energy, thus purchase this energy as bundled renewable energy.
  The Net Present Value (NPV) of this PPA must be equal to or less than the cost of current brown power over the term of the contract.

NAVFAC SW is seeking sources to provide the Marine Corps a renewable energy PPA pursuant to 10 USC 2922a for a period between 15 to 20 years. 

Responses to this market research/sources sought shall include potential site and locations for direct connection, type of renewable power generation system(s), total land area requirements, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of the Marine Corps.

THIS MARKET RESEARCH/SOURCES SOUGHT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.
  This market research is being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential contractors prior to determining the issuance of an award.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from the potential sources as a result of this market research/sources sought.  It is requested that interested parties submit to the Contracting Officer a capabilities statement package.

<p>1.0 Overview:<br />The Department of State (the Department) requests that interested businesses provide specific evidence that they are capable of meeting or exceeding the Department's minimum objectives identified below. The Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA), Office of Consular Systems and Technology Services (CST), is issuing this Full and Open Sources Sought/Request for Information (SS-RFI) for planning purposes only in support of the Department's market research.

<p>1.1 Background: <br />DoS, in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), developed and implemented U.S. card-format travel cards: the Passport Card and Border Crossing Card. The Passport Card is an accepted alternative to the traditional book-style passport at U.S. land ports of entry and certain sea ports-of-entry (POEs) since June 1, 2009. The Passport Card is functional in the DHS ReadyLane system, an integrated, automated border-crossing identification system including programs such as NEXUS, Secure Electronic Network for Travelers' Rapid Inspection (SENTRI), and Free and Secure Trade Program (FAST).</p>
<p>The Department also issues a Border Crossing Card (BCC) to qualified citizens of and residents in Mexico. The BCC allows them to enter defined border zones in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas for business and pleasure. The BCC is effectively a visitor visa that, when presented together with a valid Mexican passport, allows the holder to travel for business or pleasure to anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>The Department personalizes the Passport Card and Border Crossing Card with the Datacard&reg; MX6000<sup>TM</sup> Card Issuance System Printers.</p>
<p>1.2 Scope:</p>
<p>The Department is seeking detailed information on a vendor to provide training, preventive and remedial (routine and priority) maintenance, and technical support services of the Datacard&reg; MX6000<sup>TM</sup> Card Issuance System Printers and related equipment involved in the printing of Passport Card and Border Crossing Cards.</p>
<p>The Department is seeking detailed information on the vendor's ability to provide new Datacard&reg; MX6000<sup>TM</sup> Card Issuance System and related equipment involved in the printing of Passport Card and Border Crossing Cards to include replacement parts, printer maintenance kits, in-line inspection systems, and in-line mailing systems as well as warranties.</p>

<p>The DoD Teleport System provides tactical users access to the Defense Information Switched Network (DISN) services in a seamless, interoperable, and economical manner anywhere in the world between latitudes 65 degrees North and South. The DoD Teleport System has been fielded in a series of generations with Generation One and Two being completed in 2010 which requires constant technical refresh/technical insertion to keep up with evolving technology. Teleport Generation 3, currently being fielded, provides for three satellite gateway enhancements funded by Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Objective Memorandum (POM) 2010 Issue Paper 3414-01. The issue paper advocated for support of critical satellite gateway enhancements which would enable the synchronized fielding of satellite terminals with their respective space segments. The critical gateway enhancements identified in the issue paper were:</p>
<p>&bull; Advanced Extremely High Frequency Extended Data Rate (AEHF XDR) terminals; <br />&bull; Wideband Global System enhanced X- and Ka-multiband (WGS X/Ka) terminals; <br />&bull; Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) <br />Systems Interoperability</p>

<DESC>1. Contract Information: The US Government is the nation's single largest energy consumer. Due to the magnitude of funds spent on energy in support of Government operations and the steady inflation of such costs, the Government is re-evaluating its operations and reducing its energy consumption. Executive Order 13423 of January 24, 2007, states the head of each agency shall improve energy efficiency by 3% annually or 30% in total by the end of fiscal year 2015, relative to each agency's fiscal year 2003 energy use baseline. The primary purpose of the proposed acquisition is to acquire the design, implementation, and operation of a Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC) energy management project for the US Army Garrison, Fort Campbell KY. <br>  <br> 2. Background: 10 USC 2913 Energy Savings Contracts and Activities, is the overarching bill for shared energy savings contracting for the DOD. The Secretary of Defense through Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 91-2 dated March 19, 1991, directed the Secretary of the Army to coordinate with the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force and with the heads of Defense Agencies to develop an integrated strategy for all Components within the service territory of each utility to coordinate activity and maximize savings. DEPPM 94-1, issued December 20, 1993, established the guidelines for participation in Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management (EC/DSM) programs offered by or to be negotiated with public utilities.  42 USC 8256 provides information relating to utility incentive programs. Four key elements of this section are highlighted below. <br>  <br>   - Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities. <br>  <br>   - Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from any such utility, to increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage electricity demand. <br>  <br>   - Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized by such agency. <br>  <br>   - If an agency satisfies the criteria that generally apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other incentives. <br>  <br> 3. Description of the Requirement: A UESC is a contracting vehicle that allows agencies to accomplish energy savings projects for their facilities without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations to pay for the improvements. Under a UESC contract, the selected UESC utility provider (Utility) will provide their own funding, provide financed funding, or a combination of their own and financed funding, for an energy conservation project that will be repaid from utility bill savings. The Utility will conduct a comprehensive energy audit to identify improvements that will result in energy savings. With coordination and approval of the Government, the Utility will design and construct an energy savings project and provide assurance that the improvements will result in savings sufficient to pay for the project over a maximum 10-year repayment period. The Utility will also develop a savings assurance plan and arrange project financing. The project energy savings will be measured over the course of the financing period.  <br>  <br> 4.

The NVGAG is a premier senior adaptive rehabilitation program, the only national multi-event sports and recreational senior's competition program designed to improve the quality of life for all older Veterans, including those with a wide range of abilities and disabilities. The National Veterans Golden Age Games needs an effective mechanism comprised of an external website and internal database that will allow Veterans to register via internet for its annual multi-event sports competition.   Registration numbers range from 800 - 1000 (athletes, coaches, and caregivers) each year.

Currently the registration forms are completed by the Veteran and /or VAMC coach/ staff and sent to the Host Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) to be scanned and the data for each Veteran entered by staff and/or volunteers.   The process has become burdensome for the Host VAMC site requiring over 3,500 hours of VA Staff and volunteers to process the applications an average of 30 - 60 minutes per application.  Approximate cost for current registration process is over $67,000.00 in staff hours.

Because online registration is part of a comprehensive plan for meeting the paperwork reduction act requirements, high availability, ease of access for Veterans, and high efficiency, it is imperative that the vendor have past experience with a senior multi-sports event with age divisions and classifications, to enable them to hit the ground running.  The vendor should have broad understanding of existing modules to provide,automating daily taks, live results, competition management, accommodations, travel reports and other requirements necessary for successful implementation of the event and a reduction of staff time at the  the Local medical facility. As a result, past performance and expertise in management of the National Senior Games was a major consideration for this market research.

The report shall also identify any problems that arose and a description of how the problems were resolved.  If problems have not been completely resolved, the Contractor shall provide an explanation including their plan and timeframe for resolving the issue.  It is expected that the Contractor will keep in communication with VA accordingly so that issues that arise are transparent to both parties to prevent escalation of outstanding issues.

<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Becton Dickinson (BD), for a purchase order that will provide for the delivery of a Bruker MALDI Biotyper instrument.  The estimated value of this order is $270,102.00.

The Government has an urgent use for an instrument capable of molecular identification, taxonomical classification or de-replication of microorganisms on existing research and development efforts currently being performed at NAMRU-6.  The instrument being procured must be able to not only perform these essential functions but also must integrate the existing technology platforms (BD Phoenix and BD EpiCenter Data Management System) currently in use at NAMRU-6.
   Current platform technologies in use were procured recently and still highly relevant in ongoing research efforts.  The Government recognizes that the Bruker MALDI Biotyper instrument is capable of performing the necessary functions required by NAMRU-6 and is specifically designed to operate with platforms outlined herein.  The Government knows of no other instruments that can fully integrate to current platforms given current proprietary restrictions.  The Government knows of no other legal distributors of this product other than BD.      

All capability statements received by 10:00AM Eastern Time on April 2, 2014, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  Information received will be considered solely for purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements shall be submitted by email ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to wayne.medina@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Library of Congress on behalf of the Office of Information Technology&nbsp;intends to issue a Contract to Feenyx Proprietary Limited on a Sole Source basis&nbsp;in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source to provide technical support and maintenance services for the Mavis Software Application.<br /><br />Background
<p>The Packard Campus for Audio Visual Conservation (PCAVC), also known as National Audio-Visual Conservation Center (NAVCC) is a state-of-the-art facility where the Library of Congress acquires, preserves and provides access to the world's largest and most comprehensive collection of films, television programs, radio broadcasts, and sound recordings.</p>
<p>The Packard Campus has globally recognized capabilities and capacities for the preservation reformatting of all audiovisual media formats (including obsolete formats dating back 100 years) and their long-term safekeeping in a petabyte-level digital storage archive. In addition to preserving the collections of the Library, the Packard Campus is also designed to provide preservation services for other archives and libraries in both the public and private sector.</p>
<p>This statement of work supports the Packard Campus operations.</p>
<p>The Library's mission is to make its resources available and useful to the Congress and the American people and to sustain and preserve a universal collection of knowledge and creativity for future generations. The Office of the Librarian is tasked to set policy and to direct and support programs and activities to accomplish the Library's mission.</p>
<p><br />Objectives</p>
<p>ITS needs to procure technical support services for the MAVIS software application from Feenyx Proprietary Limited</p>
<p>This software product is the archival collection management software used in the MBRS Division, with additional users in the American Folk Life Center. The software product was first implemented in 1997 and will continue to support activities throughout the division at the Packard Campus in Culpepper.</p>
<p>Given the bankruptcy of Wizard Information Services, the original vendors of this application, Feenyx Proprietary Limited is now the sole known service provider for this software application. The support services are needed to facilitate the development of custom NAVCC software that integrates with the MAVIS application. The development of this software is a critical operational element for the NAVCC mission. MBRS and ITS staff require ongoing direct consultation with MAVIS technical support staff in order to remedy critical application problems.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>General Requirements</p>
<p>Provide technical support and maintenance services for the MAVIS software application.</p>

<DESC>SUMMARY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Commerce, seeks information from the public on NIST's potential transition of time services from a NIST-only service to private sector operation of an ensemble of time servers that will provide NIST-traceable time information in a number of different formats over the public Internet.
<p>ADDRESSES: Comments will be accepted by e-mail only. Comments must be sent to thomas.obrian@nist.gov with the subject line "Internet Time Service Comments." Comments submitted after the due date may not be considered. <br />All comments will be made publicly available on http://tf.nist.gov as submitted. Accordingly, proprietary or confidential information should not be included in any comments, as they will be posted without change.</p>
<p>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas O'Brian; 303-497-4570; thomas.obrian@nist.gov</p>
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:<br />Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 261(b), the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of the Navy, is responsible for maintaining and interpreting Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) as official time for the United States. UTC is the time scale maintained through the General Conference on Weights and Measures. The Secretary of Commerce has delegated authority for maintaining and interpreting UTC to the Director of the NIST. The NIST version of UTC is designated as UTC(NIST).<br /><br />To facilitate broad access to UTC(NIST), the Time and Frequency Division of the NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory currently operates an ensemble of time servers, which are located at a number of sites in the continental U.S. (A list of the current locations is on the Internet Time Service page at http://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi.) The servers are connected to the public Internet and respond to requests for time in three formats: Network Time Protocol (NTP), the DAYTIME format and the TIME format. <br /><br />The generally accepted voluntary standards, containing detailed descriptions, for these three time formats is set forth in a series of Request for Comment (RFC) documents from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). These RFCs can be accessed through the IETF website: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-index.html :<br />NTP format: RFC 1305 http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1305.txt<br />DAYTIME format: RFC 867 http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc867.txt <br />TIME format: RFC 868 http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc868.txt <br /><br />Higher level summaries of these time formats are available at the NIST Internet Time Service website: http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/its.cfm<br />The servers are synchronized to UTC as maintained by an ensemble of atomic clocks at the NIST Boulder Laboratories. This time is generally referred to as UTC(NIST) to distinguish it from UTC, a paper time scale computed periodically by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (the BIPM). The UTC(NIST) time scale is steered towards UTC using occasional adjustments in frequency, and the difference is typically on the order of a few nanoseconds.<br />The ensemble also includes three time servers that are synchronized to UTC(NIST) and that support only the authenticated version of NTP using the symmetric-key method and the Message Digest 5 (MD5) hash algorithm. The authenticated service is limited to users who register with NIST and receive a unique key that is linked to their network address. The key is used to authenticate the time packets from NIST by means of the MD5 hash method as described in the RFC documents referenced above.</p>
<p>The servers also support anonymous read-only connections that use the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which allow users to download example software, "read me" files and similar documents. The FTP service also allows users to download a list of leap seconds, including future leap seconds that have been announced but have not yet occurred.<br /><br />The ensemble of servers receives approximately 6.5 billion time requests per day, or about 75,000 requests per second. Approximately 85% of these requests are for time in the NTP format, and the balance are about equally divided between the DAYTIME and TIME formats. The number of simultaneous FTP connections is not closely monitored, but, based on occasional random sampling, there are approximately 1000 simultaneous FTP connections at any time.<br /><br />NIST is considering transitioning the provision of its time services from a NIST-only service to private sector operation of an ensemble of time servers that will provide NIST-traceable time information to improve provision of these services, and hereby requests information on how best to realize this transition so as to assure the continued integrity, availability, and accuracy of the time messages. NIST views the transition as a means of broadening the availability of the NIST time-scale data and fostering the creation of new time services and layered products that could make use of that data. At the same time, NIST seeks to ensure that the time messages provided by the servers are as accurate as possible, consistent with the technical limitations of the public Internet. This requirement is especially important for current (and prospective) financial and commercial users of the service, many of whom are legally required to ensure that the time stamps that they use in their data centers are traceable to the national standard time as maintained at NIST. NIST will work with private sector operator(s) to ensure that these legal traceability requirements are satisfied.<br /><br />The goals of the time service are:<br /><br />a. Respond to requests for time in a number of network-standard formats. The accuracy of the time at the server should be significantly better than 0.01 millisecond (0.00001 s), to support both current applications and enable near-term future enhancements. A number of existing users of the NIST services have already expressed the need for time data with an accuracy approaching 1 microsecond, and the system should be designed to provide this level of service in the future without significant modification. The accuracy received by a user depends on the stability of the network delay and is usually not under the control of the server. However, improvements in the stability of the network delays are already available in principle, and it is likely that these improvements will enable support for greater accuracy of the time service in the not too distant future, possibly using formats that are not currently supported by the NIST service.<br /><br />b. Provide geographical diversity in the location of the time servers. This goal seeks to minimize the impact of a single network failure or the failure of the hardware at any site. In addition, geographical diversity generally provides better accuracy by reducing the network delay for a larger number of users.<br /><br />c. Provide a local reference time scale at each server that can support the full accuracy of the time service for a minimum of 180 days, even if the link to the NIST time scale is lost. The local reference scale should have redundant components and be designed with no single point of failure. This "hold-over" capability is particularly important if the links between the servers and NIST are realized by means of signals from satellites such as the signals from the Global Positioning System, even if the signals are used in common-view. (The common-view method, in which several stations receive the signals from the same satellite at the same time, reduces, but does not eliminate the sensitivity of the synchronization process to errors in the data and time signals transmitted by the satellites.) The signals from navigation satellites are increasingly degraded by jamming and spoofing, and these problems are becoming more common, so that a simple reliance on these signals (without a local very stable reference clock) is not adequately robust for a national time service.<br /><br />d. Provide links between each server location and the NIST atomic clock ensemble that supports the accuracy of the time service as outlined in paragraph a., and is as robust as possible. The accuracy of the link and the accuracy of the local time reference discussed in the previous paragraph will probably be designed together, with the result that the combination is more robust than either component alone would be.<br /><br />e. Provide network bandwidth and connectivity that can support the current number of requests with a significant margin for future growth. The messages used to exchange timing information are small - 100 octets or less - but there are a large number of them, so that the load on the network elements, which typically must process every request independent of its size, is larger than a simple estimate based on the number of octets in each request multiplied by the number of requests. In addition, the accuracy and stability of the time service depends on (and is usually limited by) the stability of the network delay, and this delay tends to become less stable and predictable once the message traffic becomes a significant fraction of the bandwidth of the hardware.<br /><br />f. Provide adequate physical security, environmental controls, backup power, and related service consistent with the critical contribution of the time servers to the national infrastructure.<br /><br />g. The time servers do not contain or transmit any confidential information. There is no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) associated with the services, and both the time messages themselves and the files that are provided for download are freely available and are based on principles and practices that have been widely disseminated. The requirements of paragraph f. are intended only to prevent alteration or destruction of the data.<br /><br />h. The system should provide adequate internal and external monitoring to ensure the integrity of the time messages. Both the NTP and the DAYTIME format should include bits that specify the health of the server, and these bits should be used to indicate that the time transmitted in the message was transmitted from a server whose time accuracy was known to be incorrect or when the accuracy could not be established. These bits should be set if an internal or external monitoring program detects a problem and not reset until the normal state is restored. Conversely, when the bits of the message are not set, this shall indicate that the server is operating normally based on a combination of internal and external checks. (Some implementations of the NTP do not use this capability and push the detection of a failed server into the application software running on the client system. This method is not adequate and is not acceptable for a service traceable to a national timing laboratory.) The NTP and DAYTIME formats also have parameters in the message that can be used to indicate that the server is operating at reduced accuracy. Depending on these parameters as the sole means for indicating the health of the service is discouraged, since they are usually based on statistical estimators that may or may not be an accurate description of the true state of affairs. The terms of service between NIST and any future service provider shall clearly specify that any implication of accuracy or traceability to national standards is suspended when any of these indicators is set. The TIME format does not have any way of transmitting the health of the server, and the server shall not respond to a request for time in this format if it is known or suspected of being unhealthy.<br /><br />i. The time servers shall transmit time signals based on UTC(NIST) and shall support insertion of leap seconds as defined and implemented by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS), and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). <br /><br />j. In addition to implementing leap seconds in the time messages as described in paragraph i., the servers shall provide advance notice of leap seconds as specified in the documentation for the NTP and DAYTIME formats. <br /><br />k. The time service is currently used by many users who are not expert in time and frequency principles or in the design of the network services that are used to communicate between the server and the hardware of the end-user. Therefore, the operator(s) should support a "help desk" facility to assist users who are having difficulty in using the services.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: The objective of this request for information is to assist NIST in determining the best ways to structure possible private sector provision of Internet Time Service. Based on the information provided, NIST may or may not issue a request for proposals or other announcement of an opportunity for such private sector provision of Internet Time Service. In this connection, the questions below are intended to assist in the formulation of comments and should not be construed as a limitation on the number of comments that interested persons may submit or as a limitation on the issues that may be addressed in such comments. Comments containing references, studies, research, and other empirical data that are not widely published should include copies of the referenced materials. Again, note that all comments will be made publicly available as submitted; therefore proprietary or confidential information should not be included. NIST is specifically interested in receiving input pertaining to one or more of the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What diversity of the geographical locations of the servers will provide the best balance between cost and accuracy consistent with the requirements outlined above?<br /><br />2. How should the sites be configured to provide the integrity, reliability, and accuracy that are required as part of a time service that must support the national infrastructure?<br /><br />3. How should the monitoring and supervisory functions be configured to ensure that the time signals are accurate and that any failure be detected? In addition, how should logging functions be implemented so that the log files can be used in the case that the accuracy of the time signals become involved in a legal proceeding?<br /><br />4. How should the link to the NIST atomic time scale be realized? What is the appropriate relationship between NIST and time service provider(s)? How should this relationship be designed to preserve the requirements of legal and technical traceability of the time stamps to national time standards?<br /><br />5. What are ways in which the relationship between the private operator(s) and NIST can best be realized? A formal agreement will be established between NIST and each private operator, and NIST seeks input on what type of agreement would best support the program. <br /><br />6. Should NIST hold a competition to select a private sector organization(s) to operate an ensemble of time servers to provide NIST-traceable time information, or should NIST make the opportunity available to all eligible parties?<br /><br />7. What are advantages and disadvantages of NIST's potential transition of time services from a NIST-only service to private sector operation of an ensemble of time servers that will provide NIST-traceable time information via the Internet? Note that NIST would continue to provide oversight of the accuracy and integrity of the Internet-based time services, and that the transition would not affect the traceability of the distributed time signals to national and international standards.<br /><br />8. What other considerations should be important in the design of the time services?</p>

<DESC><p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>A. INTRODUCTION: Technical Experimentation (TE) Collaboration <br />This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals and Government labs to submit technology experimentation nominations addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions to future SOF capabilities. After review of the technology experimentation nomination submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to demonstrate their technologies at the USSOCOM sponsored Technical Experimentation event. The TE venue will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities. Industry participation in experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that USSOCOM will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:<br />1. Background: USSOCOM has traditionally conducted Technical Experimentation events at Muscatatuck UTC, IN; at Avon Park, FL, and Camp Roberts, CA. These Technical experiments are conducted with representatives from Government R&amp;D organizations, academia, and private industry. Technical Experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the SOF warfighter. The event facilitates SOCOM personnel to identify potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet SOF technical objectives and thrust areas. Materiel solutions brought to the event should be between a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 and 6. Experiments may be between a half day and five days in duration and be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions. At the discretion of USSOCOM, respondents may be asked to complete a vendor loan agreement (Attachment 3).</p>
<p>2. Experimentation Focus: Experiments will be conducted from 8 to 17 July 2014, at Muscatatuck Urban Training Center, IN and will explore emerging technology solutions and revolutionary improvements in technology for Special Operations Warfare. Any technology-based experiment conducted at the event should provide a revolutionary improvement in SOF operations.

Only verbal feedback is provided by users or Subject Matter Experts (SME). No written feedback is provided by the Government.<br />- User Evaluation - Technologies are demonstrated using tabletop or field conditions methods. Technology developers receive on site verbal feedback from users or SMEs and a brief written assessment of the technology after the conclusion of the event.<br />- In-depth assessment - Multiple users conduct hands-on detailed operational assessments, SMEs conduct technical functionality, and technical measurement as needed. The technology developer may need to provide instructions and training in the use of the technology and hand over the technology for trials by users. Trials are scenario-based and may run from a few hours to several days. A detailed report is written after the event.</p>
<p>Technology developers requesting one of the methods of feedback stated above are advised that the Government will consider the request for feedback desired and ultimately reserves the right as to the degree of feedback and effort to conduct for a technology invited to participate during a TE event.<br /><br />A complete submission consists of:<br />1. - Completely filling all pertinent information in the on line nomination application. <br />- For UAS and TALOS areas of technology in the on-line nomination form, title block start with the words "UAS" or "TALOS" followed by the idea or technology. <br />- In the experiment objectives block, start with one of the following feedback titles (PARTICIPATION ONLY, DEMONSTRATION, USER EVALUATION, or IN-DEPTH ASSESSMENT) for the degree of feedback desired, then fill in the rest of the experiment objectives block with the results you expect to achieve during the TE event. NOTE: If you submit an online nomination for UAS related experiments following the UAS CONOPS procedures then you do not need to state a degree of feedback desired.<br />2. - System safety worksheet<br />3. - Composite risk management worksheet,<br />4. - Instructions on how to use the technology (as needed)<br />5. - STA or NTIA document (for developmental radio frequency emitting devices)<br />6. - Experiment plan (the online field titled "Plan" should be sufficient for simple experiment plan descriptions) for more detailed or complex plans you may need to attach an experiment plan to the on-line form<br />7. - A picture of the device with a short description of the size (show dimensions or compare against known objects like currency or rulers), weight, and power requirements<br />8. - Vendor loan agreement (on a case by case basis as requested by USSOCOM). <br />Select respondents will be invited to participate in USSOCOM experiments. USSOCOM shall provide venues, supporting infrastructure, and assessment (operational and technical, based on availability of resources and written request) personnel at no cost to invited respondent(s). Respondent's travel costs and technology experiments will be at the respondent's expense. The TE venue will only provide basic access to training areas or ranges to conduct experiments, a facility to connect to the internet, basic venue infrastructure including frequency allocation/deconfliction, and portable power if needed. Invited respondents must be prepared to be self-sufficient during the execution of their experiments and not dependent on venue resources for success.<br />D. BASIS FOR SELECTION TO PARTICIPATE:<br />Selection of respondents to participate will be based on the extent to which the technology represents a particular class or level of capability that can be provided to Special Operations Forces. <br />Other considerations include:<br />- Technical maturity<br />- Relevance of or adaptability to military operations/missions<br />- Relevance to current operational needs<br />- Relevance to Event Focus Area<br />E.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to&nbsp;The University of Michigan&nbsp;for updated NEISS-AIP archived data for University of Michigan, ICPSR Public Use Data Files. Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System - All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP), 2000-2010 and CDC/NEISS Nonfatal Firearm Injury Surveillance Study, 1993-2010 have been archived at ICPSR for more than one decade. These NEISS data sets have been maintained as part of a comprehensive violence, injury, and criminal justice data base that includes the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD), operated by ICPSR in partnership with the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), Department of Justice (DOJ). ICPSR is the only Contractor that operates and provides data processing/management services for data sets within this unique and comprehensive data base. ICPSR's primary mission is to archive public health, criminal justice and social science data sets for sharing with social/public health researchers. They have demonstrated, by past performance, the expertise, infrastructure, and facilities necessary to archive, manage, and provide ready access, through an existing, user-friendly, web-based user interface, to these NEISS data sets and associated documentation in a professional manner with high integrity and necessary information security. ICPSR is highly regarded for their outstanding service in providing easy access of federal public use files to researchers. No other organization has this capacity or track record. Also, because ICPSR has been archiving these NEISS data sets and associated documentation for over a decade, continuing this service is most beneficial for CDC. . This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1&nbsp; 13.106-1(b) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within&nbsp;thirteen (13) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to&nbsp;William Brannen&nbsp;at&nbsp; by&nbsp;5:00 P.M.&nbsp;March 31, 2014.</p>

<DESC><strong>Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MedLog) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Syringes with Needle Combinations Detachable. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Syringes with Needle Combinations Detachable products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Syringes with Needle Combinations Detachable. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Syringes with Needle Combinations Detachable will be established approximately September 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately October 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Syringes with Needle Combinations Detachable. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Syringes with Needle Combinations Detachable.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Syringes with Needle Combinations Detachable. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $616,424. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Eighty seven product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the 87 product groups, eight represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. Of those eight items, four items are considered the requirement for addition to the QSL and account for 81.07% ($499,719) of the total volume in sales ($616,424). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.</strong> The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></span></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />Syringes with Needle Combinations Detachable requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?

Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly? (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <BR> <BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for eighteen (quantity:18), 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14, manufactured by AMVC Corporation.  The only authorized distributor of this product for the KSC area is Adapco Incorporated of Sanford, Florida. This product will be used to control mosquitoes in outlying areas of KSC, where the use of aerial equipment is necessary to apply chemicals to areas impossible to spray without an aircraft. Dibrom 14 is supplied annually by KSC to the Brevard County Mosquito Control District (BCMCD) in accordance with the Mosquito Control Agreement between KSC, Air Force Eastern Test Range, US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and Brevard County. There are several areas at the launch pads and Launch Complex 39, where normal chemicals used at KSC cannot be sprayed due to chemical corrosiveness and flight hardware. Moreover, these areas are also very large and impossible to spray without an aircraft, which KSC does not possess. The agreement provides the equipment (aircraft) to spray large areas of water in the KSC area to control mosquitoes without having to spray directly around the launch pads. Dibrom 14 is the only chemical that can be used because it is the only chemical BCMCD is licensed to spray in the KSC and surrounding areas. <p> This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIHLM2014039SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.<br /></p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure professional services to develop and maintain a Health Literacy Tool Shed educational and outreach website to create a unique resource center to support health literacy researchers and enhance the quality of national and international health literacy research. This acquisition is Full and Open. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Health literacy has become a well-established area of study. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has a health literacy working group that coordinates NLM's work with similar working groups administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) also has an active health literacy interest group among its membership.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed, a one-stop (Internet-based) location, will create an arena where researchers can obtain many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve the methodological quality of health literacy research. The Health Literacy Tool Shed represents a service that provides outreach to health literacy professionals. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to find many of the available constructs and quantitative tools used to measure health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research. Although the project's beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the project is designed to create a needed educational resource.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will organize constructs, measures, and instruments that are currently scattered across an array of health literacy research. There is no current resource where practitioners and researchers can consult what health literacy measurement measures, constructs, and instruments are best suited to a planned project. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information on health literacy assessment instruments, this foundational gap inhibits the field's development as a coherent body of knowledge and practice. The end of methodological fragmentation in the health literacy field (and the availability of a website to find the best instruments for specific projects) also will assist NLM's future health literacy research and help make NLM a leader in health literacy research and practice.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be a unique educational resource. While this type of resource often is touted by health literacy researchers and practitioners, currently the proposed educational resource does not exist nor is a similar resource under construction elsewhere.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective</p>
<p>This Health Literacy Tool Shed educational and outreach project creates a unique resource center to support health literacy researchers and enhance the quality of national and international health literacy research. While the project's beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the current project creates an educational resource that provides outreach to a research community as well as a topic of interest to the NLM.</p>
<p>The project will create a one-stop website, where researchers can assess many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve health literacy research. The proposed Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will provide a vital outreach service for the health literacy research community. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to identify and assess many of the available constructs and quantitative measures used to assess health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research in one, accessible location.</p>
<p>Although dozens of health literacy measurement tools have been introduced and the literature has proliferated, a core problem in health literacy outreach and intervention efforts is the uneven quality of methods used by health literacy assessment teams and a confusing array of constructs, measures, and instruments. Some examples of the current methodological confusion and fragmentation in health literacy research is found in Appendix A, which suggests there are at least fifteen (15) separate measures based on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy. Appendix A also notes there are nine different measures based in the Test of Functional Health Literacy (TOFHLA) as well as many other constructs and measures of aspects of health literacy.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread availability of health literacy measurement tools, criticisms from independent reviewers reflect that health literacy research methodological flaws may stem from a lack of infrastructure to support health literacy researchers and practitioners. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information about health literacy assessment constructs, measures, and instruments, the gap impedes the health literacy field's development into a more coherent body of knowledge and practice. <br /><br />The Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will create for the first time: 1) access to health literacy assessment tools; 2) a health literacy tool selection process for investigators; 3) an overview of researcher adherence to various health literacy instruments; and, 4) background information about a construct/measure's validity or empirical validation.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be a virtual indexing system for health literacy methods with specific information on the following:</p>
<p>&#9679;Administration instructions (how long it takes to administer, number of questions, languages, method of administration, etc.)</p>
<p>&#9679;Constructs measured (i.e. numeracy, word pronunciation, problem solving, general health maintenance, etc.)</p>
<p>&#9679;Links to the instruments (or information on how to obtain the instrument when the Contractor has not secured permission to post the instrument) and to validation articles</p>
<p>&#9679;Expert commentary on strengths and limitations and on how to select instruments in various research and practice contexts.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed also could identify some gaps in the current array of health literacy instruments and provide a venue for users to discuss the development of further health literacy research assessment tools. In addition, the Health Literacy Tool Shed provides an excellent complement to NLM's Consumer Health Informatics Research Resource (chirr.nlm.nih.gov), which provides general information about common constructs used in consumer health informatics assessment, including health literacy.</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria</p>
<p>1)The Contractor must possess extensive academic knowledge and expertise in the field of health literacy research and extensive experience in health literacy practice in both health care delivery and public health.<br />2)The Contractor must display a track record of national and international leadership in evaluating health literacy research.<br />3)The Contractor's subject matter experts (health literacy researchers and practitioners) must possess a Ph.D. or M.D. degree and publish regularly in a refereed academic journal.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services needed to complete this project. All work performed under this procurement shall be monitored by the NLM Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>General Contractor Tasks</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide an education resource that encompasses many of the existing research measures, constructs, and instruments listed in Appendix A. The Contractor shall create a website that provides interactive guidance to enhance the use of health literacy research constructs, measures, and instruments.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-14-Q-200084 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopter Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), Airbus Helicopter France and A.D.R. France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items.  Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.    

SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET HSCG38-14-Q-200084 - REQUIREMENTS FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.

NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 

The Government reserves the right to withhold any item or group of items contained in this solicitation upon award.  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, no award, or multiple awards if after considering the additional administrative costs it is in the Governments best interest to do so.  The Government shall assume, for the purpose of making multiple awards, that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation.  Individual awards shall be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest cost to the Government including the assumed administrative costs.  

NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.

SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENT TITLED TERMS AND CONDITIONS  HSCG38-14-Q-200084 FOR APPLICABLE CLAUSES, INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUTION CRITERIA.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>This order is amended to give answers to questions that arose during the scheduled Site Visit on March 14, 2014.<br /><br />&nbsp;Change the COTR (Contracting Officer's Technical Representative from Thomas Niederriter to Marshall Reed and appoint Thomas Niederriter as the COR (Contracting Officer's Representative).
<p><br />1) Please confirm that the locked storage room located by the back gate / loading zone seen during the site visit, is the central pick-up location the bid references.</p>
<p>The locked storage room is the only place we store biological waste for pick it up.<br /><br />2) The bid states that the EERC has "a need for turnkey services to pack, label, manifest, load, transport and dispose of Biological/Infectious and Regulated Medical Waste, 6.2, UN3291, PGII as detailed herein and in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications contained in this document." Please define what is expected from the contracted vendor in regards to packing and labeling. What is the current process?</p>
<p>Packaging and labeling of the package with a Generator Label is done by ERRC personnel. Contracted vendor will weigh the prepared package and place it on their truck for removal.</p>
<p>As stated in the Statement of Work and clarified in the first amendment all supplies will be included in the per pound price (this includes box, heavy duty liner and red bio-bag) or any other mechanism proposed.</p>
<p>3) Please describe how this waste currently being collected within the facility, and then transferred (moved) to the central pick up location.</p>
<p>The Custodial staff removes the prepared package from the hall once the scientist has completed his/her prescribed tasks. The custodial staff has been trained on what to look for on the boxes and will not transport a box to the holding room unless all criteria are met. That includes filling out Generator Label, Stains, Evidence of leakage and properly taping.</p>
<p>4) Would pricing for an alternative solution (96 gallon medical waste containers, with liners, wheels and locks) be accepted in regards to the collection, transfer, and storage of this waste from the collection sites to the central pick-up location?</p>
<p>ERRC would be interested in seeing the pricing for an alternative solution, especially if that solution is puncture resistant, increasing safety of the custodial staff.</p>
<p>1) Does the USDA staff pack the boxes, or is the contractor required to pack the boxes?</p>
<p>Packaging and labeling of the package with a Generator Label is done by ERRC personnel. Contracted vendor will weigh the prepared package and place it on their truck for removal.</p>
<p>As stated in the Statement of Work and clarified in the first amendment all supplies will be included in the per pound price (this includes box, heavy duty liner and red bio-bag) or any other mechanism proposed.</p>
<p>2) How dense is the material in the boxes?<br />a. Is there any dirt?</p>
<p>There is no dirt discarded from the ERRC. There occasionally are meats, such as ham, steak, kidneys discarded. These are food stuff and not pathological samples.</p>
<p>b. Is autoclave an acceptable treatment for the material or must it be incinerated to assure the proper efficacy?</p>
<p>There are no Pathological samples or debris discarded by ERRC. Our biological waste contains autoclaved petri dishes, meats (store bought), eggs and other foodstuff and post-harvest materials from BSL-1 and BSL-2 laboratories. ERRC does not maintain nor work with human samples. ERRC does not maintain nor work with live animals.</p>
<p>3) How is the material currently weighed for the billing?<br />a. Does the contractor bring a scale to weigh the material?</p>
<p>Currently the contractor brings a scale in the back of the truck.</p>
<p>b. Is bringing a scale acceptable, or does the facility provide a scale to weigh the material?</p>
<p>We are purchasing a new scale to spot check packages to ensure the scientists are labeling properly. This scale can be used by the contractor. We will calibrate this scale yearly and the contractor will be able to check the precision with a known weight if needed. The contractor is welcome to bring their own scale but we would like to be notified if there are any large discrepancies from the labeled weight to the actual weight.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution  <br>  of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the  <br>  GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and  <br>  be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  <br>    <br>  Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command  <br>  Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road  <br>  Rm: A6SE040.001  <br>  Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000  <br>  Phone: (256) 450-8165  <br>  Fax: (256) 450-8840  <br>  E-mail: amcprotests@conus.army.mil  <br>    <br>  The AMC-Level Protest Procedures are accessible via the Internet at:  <br>  www.amc.army.mil/amc/commandcounsel.html.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 0002 to solicitation W31P4Q-14-T-0074 is to answer the following questions: <br>  <br> Question 2:  Are all of the pipes and related welds to be inspected located in one area (like a stockpile) or are they spread out over the 1100 feet? <br>  <br> Answer2:  Piping is spread out in 4 8 inch lines across 1100 feet.  Not in a stockpile. <br>  <br> Question 3:  Will all of the welds be accessible for inspection at the same time? <br>  <br> Answer 3:  Yes, all welds will be accessible for inspection. <br>  <br> Question 4:  What is the surface condition of these pipes? i.e. Will there be any cleaning required prior to a proper Ultrasonic (UT) exam? <br>  <br> Answer 4:  The area around the welds may have to be smoothed if abraded or rough; the weld bead itself will not. <br>  <br> Question 5:  The work statement states Ultrasonic Testing (UT) Linear Phased array (PA) as the desired technique.  As long as we meet all technical and reporting requirements, can we use our Ultrasonic Testing (UT) Time of Flight Defraction (ToFD) instead in lieu of the PA techniques? <br>  <br> Answer 5:  The Army requires Ultrasonic Linear Array inspection for the HDPE piping to provide the optimal Outside Diameter (OD) inspection sensitivity.  <br>  <br> Question 6:  On the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website, how do I find the correct link that will allow me to bid on a solicitation? <br>  <br> Answer 6: As stated in the solicitation, quotes may be submitted to Tammy Benson at tammy.j.benson@us.army.mil or via facsimile at 256-313-2392, marked to the attention of Tammy Benson.  Quotes are not required to be submitted via the ASFI website.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

These end items are components of the fuel regulation systems on various airframes and engines. Testing of these end items is conducted solely at Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB) on AFATS stands, located in B3902.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt">This project shall employ commercial off the shelf (COTS) components to upgrade obsolete hardware and software, specifically the Virtual Address eXtension (VAX) computer system, its associated modules and proprietary Ada/Bendix software. These computer systems have reached the end of their useful life and can only be supported via purchase of used components. Installing and using COTS hardware and software will increase support and reduce costs due to a much larger supplier base for parts.<br /><br /><strong></strong></span></p>
<p align="left"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Performance Requirements:</span></strong></p>
<p>Upgraded test stands will remain capable of performing exactly the same tasks/testing as originally designed and will have hardware/software configurations that match existing upgraded AFATS test stands. The upgraded configuration shall comply with the requirements of the current version of 1TL32-6755-1 and 1TL32-6755-4 including all appendices. This includes, but is not limited to, the installation and configuration of Program Logic Controls (PLC) and cabinets, Wonderware installation and configuration, installation of human machine interface (HMI) touch screens and embedded computer systems.</p>
<p align="left">Upon completion of the upgrade, the test screens on each test stand shall be configured by the Contractor to test the fuel accessories specified in the Performance of Work Statement (PWS). Once the test screens have been configured, the Contractor shall perform correlation testing as specified in the PWS to verify correlation between existing test stands and the upgraded test stands.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Evaluation Criteria:<br /></span></strong><br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt">The Contractor shall have three (3) years of experience integrating systems using Wonderware Intouch or equivalent software.</span></p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:<br /></span></strong><br />Has your end user/customer considered upgrading only the Virtual Address eXtension (VAX) computer systems within the current AFATS stands?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span><br />If the goal of this request is to get away from the VAX computers, it is possible to replace a VAX with a VAX emulator running on a COTS platform while making no changes to the software that runs thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:<br /><br /></span></strong>Replacing the current VAX system with a VAX emulator isn't really an option at this point since we have six AFATS test stands (and eight non-AFATS test stands ) already upgraded using Wonderware\Siemens software. We would like all of the upgraded test stands to remain consistent from a support stand point. Additionally, when these test stands have to be upgraded 20 years down the road it's going to be much easier if all the test stands have the same base design.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:<br /><br /></span></strong>Does the Government intend to have a site visit/site survey?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:<br /><br /></span><em>YES.</em></strong> <strong><em>The site visit/site survey will be held&nbsp;at 0900 on April 2, 2014 at Building 3902, Room 106 for the purpose of answering questions regarding this solicitation.</em></strong> &nbsp;</span>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is a follow up to RFI # W15P7T-13-S-MX20 which was posted to FedBizOpps on 15 February 2013.  This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid, Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Responses to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs, or charges by the Government, will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement, or the Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this request. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals, or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives, and/or Performance Based Specification(s). Parties responding to this RFI are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <br>  <br> The Product Manager Electro-Optic/Infrared (PdM EO/IR) Payloads is conducting market research to determine the status of sustainment capabilities for Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors to support airborne platforms, including aerostats, unmanned aerial systems, and manned aircraft. In particular, the Government is interested in maintenance, repair, repair on demand, sensor buyback, transportation, and training capabilities for EO/IR sensors, to include L-3 WESCAM sensor systems in the  quote mark MX quote mark  series (e.g. MX-15 and MX-20 sensor systems). The Government is interested in approaches, facilities, resources, contractual relationships, and other capabilities that may contribute to improved value to the Government for the sustainment of MX sensor systems. <br>  <br> Maintenance Support Objective: <br>  <br> Support shall include the sustainment, repair, and repair on demand of systems at the depot level and the forward deployed intermediate level. Depot level capabilities must also include re-build/refurbishment of sensors damaged during shipment, crashes, or battle damage. Support capabilities must be tailorable to a range of system Operational Availability (Ao) levels. Approaches must also address a flexible capability to support an expanding fleet of EO/IR sensors with multiple sensor or platform configurations in locations around the world. The Government is also interested in the capability to produce EO/IR sensors, in either of two classes (mid-size or large-size), with minimum performance as outlined below, in support of either replacing sensors at end-of-life or new operational requirements. The Government is also looking into possible options as part of a sensor buyback program whereby the Government gains some form of future credit for sensors returned to the MX manufacturer that are no longer in operational service. <br>  <br>  <br> Performance Objectives: <br> Mid-size EO/IR sensor: Detection Field of View (FOV)  greater than  6.5 degrees diagonal FOV. Detection of vehicle size targets with 70% probability, 9.0 km minimum. Detection of personnel with 70% probability, 3.5 km minimum for both IR and TV sensors. Identification of vehicle size targets with 70% probability, 5.5 km minimum for both IR and TV. Include eye-safe laser range-finder with a range from 500m to 10 km. The airborne system components must weigh no more than 165 lbs. <br>  <br> Large-size EO/IR sensor: Detection FOV  greater than  3.5 degrees diagonal FOV. Detection of vehicle size targets with 70% probability, 17.0 km minimum. Detection of personnel with 70% probability, 7.0 km minimum for both IR and TV sensors. Identification of vehicle size targets with 70% probability, 8.0 km minimum for both IR and TV. Include eye safe laser range-finder with a range from 500m to 30 km. The airborne system components must weigh no more than 200 lbs. <br>  <br> All EO/IR sensor classes must include a high magnification thermal imager, daylight camera with zoom lens, daylight camera with spotter lens, and laser-illuminator to mark ground targets. The laser illuminator should be compatible with Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) and have constant and pulse capability. High-definition capability in both electro-optic and infrared is desired. Sensors must operate in all weather conditions, and must be capable of operating in a zero wind environment (in the case of aerostat installation). <br>  <br> Recommended RFI Response Format: <br>  <br> All material submitted in response to this RFI must be Unclassified. Interested parties possessing the capability to meet the objectives outlined above are requested to provide a response in electronic format describing the approach to meet the objectives established above, and should address the following items: <br>  <br> 1. Company Name, Contact Name, Position, Telephone, E-mail, Company URL. <br>  <br> 2. Capabilities to produce new systems with a low risk approach to meeting the performance objectives outlined above. Include lead time to first unit delivery and maximum production rate per month. Include suggestions for acceleration of system delivery, test, qualification, economical ordering quantities, economical range quantity breaks, realistic schedules for production ramp-up and surge quantities, and monthly production sustainment quantities. Include information about the current level of environmental qualification and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) testing of the system being described, as well as its predicted or actual reliability (e.g. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)) with supporting data that validates reliability claims. Provide sufficient documentation to support any claims that the system performance will meet the minimum performance capabilities contained herein.  <br>  <br> 3. Outline of supply chain considerations with emphasis on any known long-lead items that may adversely impact sensor repairs in an accelerated environment, and strategies to overcome potential parts obsolescence problems. Supply chain considerations for new sensor production should also be addressed. <br>  <br> 4. Technical management approach including product and component designs, Configuration Management, Engineering Change Proposals, test data, and integration between sensors and platforms. <br>  <br> 5. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price estimates for repair and repair on demand services (at each level), spare components, training, and production of new sensor systems. <br>  <br> 6. Provide an assessment of the associated risks for the program, and respective risk mitigation approaches. <br>  <br> 7. Corporate capabilities ( i.e., available facilities and assets to include existing production and repair facilities, total available square footage, to include additional floor space available for expansion and the amount that could be dedicated to the program; quality management programs, manufacturing process controls, and Configuration Management control systems) and company profile (i.e., company type, US or non-US ownership, CAGE code, DUNs number, size, and status as listed in the Central Contractor Registration). <br>  <br> 8. Past and current relevant performance information. RFI Data Analysis Request <br>  <br> 9. The availability of the MX sensor Technical Data Package that would be used by the Government to produce and sustain the system. <br>  <br> In addition to the above, responses shall provide a solution to the notional scenario below. This response should include: consideration of intermediate level repairs, depot level repairs, repair on demand, repair facility capacity and locations, repair turn-around times for standard/non-standard/planned maintenance, and MTBF.

Responses to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs, or charges by the Government, will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement, or the Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this request. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals, or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives, and/or Performance Based Specification(s). Parties responding to this RFI are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.  <br>    <br>  The Product Manager Electro-Optic/Infrared (PdM EO/IR) Payloads is conducting market research to determine the status of sustainment capabilities for Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors to support airborne platforms, including aerostats, unmanned aerial systems, and manned aircraft. In particular, the Government is interested in maintenance, repair, repair on demand, sensor buyback, transportation, and training capabilities for EO/IR sensors, to include L-3 WESCAM sensor systems in the  quote mark MX quote mark  series (e.g. MX-15 and MX-20 sensor systems). The Government is interested in approaches, facilities, resources, contractual relationships, and other capabilities that may contribute to improved value to the Government for the sustainment of MX sensor systems.  <br>    <br>  Maintenance Support Objective:  <br>    <br>  Support shall include the sustainment, repair, and repair on demand of systems at the depot level and the forward deployed intermediate level. Depot level capabilities must also include re-build/refurbishment of sensors damaged during shipment, crashes, or battle damage. Support capabilities must be tailorable to a range of system Operational Availability (Ao) levels. Approaches must also address a flexible capability to support an expanding fleet of EO/IR sensors with multiple sensor or platform configurations in locations around the world. The Government is also interested in the capability to produce EO/IR sensors, in either of two classes (mid-size or large-size), with minimum performance as outlined below, in support of either replacing sensors at end-of-life or new operational requirements. The Government is also looking into possible options as part of a sensor buyback program whereby the Government gains some form of future credit for sensors returned to the MX manufacturer that are no longer in operational service.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Performance Objectives:  <br>  Mid-size EO/IR sensor: Detection Field of View (FOV)  greater than  6.5 degrees diagonal FOV. Detection of vehicle size targets with 70% probability, 9.0 km minimum. Detection of personnel with 70% probability, 3.5 km minimum for both IR and TV sensors. Identification of vehicle size targets with 70% probability, 5.5 km minimum for both IR and TV. Include eye-safe laser range-finder with a range from 500m to 10 km. The airborne system components must weigh no more than 165 lbs.  <br>    <br>  Large-size EO/IR sensor: Detection FOV  greater than  3.5 degrees diagonal FOV. Detection of vehicle size targets with 70% probability, 17.0 km minimum. Detection of personnel with 70% probability, 7.0 km minimum for both IR and TV sensors. Identification of vehicle size targets with 70% probability, 8.0 km minimum for both IR and TV. Include eye safe laser range-finder with a range from 500m to 30 km. The airborne system components must weigh no more than 200 lbs.  <br>    <br>  All EO/IR sensor classes must include a high magnification thermal imager, daylight camera with zoom lens, daylight camera with spotter lens, and laser-illuminator to mark ground targets. The laser illuminator should be compatible with Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) and have constant and pulse capability. High-definition capability in both electro-optic and infrared is desired. Sensors must operate in all weather conditions, and must be capable of operating in a zero wind environment (in the case of aerostat installation).  <br>    <br>  Recommended RFI Response Format:  <br>    <br>  All material submitted in response to this RFI must be Unclassified. Interested parties possessing the capability to meet the objectives outlined above are requested to provide a response in electronic format describing the approach to meet the objectives established above, and should address the following items:  <br>    <br>  1. Company Name, Contact Name, Position, Telephone, E-mail, Company URL.  <br>    <br>  2.

SOLICITAITON WAS RELEASED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON 03 FEBRUARY 2014...<br /><br />NSWC Indian Head requires contractor support in performing the functions of an Alteration Installation Team (AIT) with the installation of Ship Alterations (S/A), Ship Change Documents (SCDs), and Ordnance Alterations (ORDALTS) as related to the Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS) on U.S. Navy, U.S. Army and U.S. Coast Guard Vessels. Contractor work shall be completed according to contract, and shall take place at varying locations and facilities including: private and public shipyards, pier side, in dry dock, CONUS, OCONUS, or at the contractor's facility. Thus, the expected contract vehicle referenced under this synopsis shall be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that will extend no longer than three years (36 months), if all options are exercised, from contract award. It will consist of one base year plus two option years. Task and delivery orders will be placed as both cost-plus-fixed-fee and firm-fixed-price, as appropriate. This requirement is considered full and open. The NAICS code is 541990. The Size Standard is $14M. The FSC code is 1230. This synopsis is for non-commercial services. The attached Data Requirements List and applicable instructions are included with this announcement. The upcoming solicitation number will be N00174-13-R-0044, and will be issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Proposals will be requested with the release of the solicitation.<br /><br />The Contractor's support shall be in accordance with specific, individually written task orders issued by NSWC IHD within the general scope of the applicable Statement of Work (SOW).<br /><br />The Government intends to make a single award resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose submissions, which comply with the instructions and conform to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors for award. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: (a) technical capability of the items and services offered to meet the minimum needs of the Government based on examination of technical approach narrative, relevant corporate experience, facilities and equipment, and personnel resources; (b) Past Performance (see FAR 52.212-1(b)(10)); and (c) Cost. These factors are of equal importance. All non-priced factors, when combined, are approximately equal to Cost in importance. However, Cost becomes more of a deciding factor of importance when offerors receive similar ratings for the other factors. General statements, that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or that paraphrases the RFQ's specifications in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirements concerning the content of the technical proposal.<br /><br />Copies of solicitation N00174-13-R-0044 will NOT be emailed, faxed, mailed or provided in person. These types of requests WILL NOT BE ACKNOWLEDGED. This synopsis is being posted to both Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and Navy Electronic Commerce On-Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by Naval Sea Systems Command. NOTE: Offerors are ineligible for award unless registered in DOD's Central Contractor Registration Database which has now been integrated with the System for Award Management (SAM). Information regarding registration and annual confirmation requirements is available at 1-866-606-8220 and http://www.sam.gov.<br /><br />Any resultant contract will be DO Rated under the Defense Priorities and Allocations system (DPAS). <br /><br />The deadline to respond to this synopsis is 04 September 2013. <br /><br />The Contract Specialist must receive any and all questions concerning the RFP no later than 5 business days before the response date of this solicitation. No questions will be accepted after the close of the solicitation. Offers and inquiries may be submitted via electronic mail to edward.rogan@navy.mil or mailed to the attention of Eddie Rogan, Code A22P at NSWC Indian Head - Picatinny Detach, Building 61, Code A22P, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.<br /><br />It is the REGISTRANT'S responsibility to periodically check the FedBizOpps or NECO.<br />

<DESC>Modification - This posting gives notice to a change to the RFI W900KKAVCATTECURFI FBO announcement in order to change the identified primary point of Contact (POC)  <br>  <br> From: From:  Michael Hickey, Michael.a.hickey@us.army.mil <br>   <br> To:  Craig Cunningham, craig.cunningham@us.army.mil <br>   <br> All remaining terms and conditions of this posting shall be unchanged. <br>  <br> General Information:  <br>    <br>  Document Type: Request for Information (RFI)  <br>  Solicitation Number: N/A  <br>  Posted Date: 30 July 2013  <br>  Original Response Date: 30 August 2013  <br>  Current Response Date: 30 August 2013  <br>  NAICS Code: Final NAICS Code to be determined.  <br>    <br>  TITLE:  Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) for the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) Environmental Control Unit Upgrade.  <br>    <br>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  AVCATT is a mobile virtual simulation training system.  It is housed in two standard over the road 53' trailers.  Each trailer has its own independently controlled environmental control unit (ECU).   Each ECU provides cooling, heating and humidity control.    <br>    <br>  PEO STRI Product Manager for Air and Command Tactical Trainers (PM ACTT), Assistant Product Manager (APM) AVCATT has a goal of reducing the ECU operating cost, improving efficiency and the reliability of the system.  This may be accomplished by upgrading or replacing the current ECU.   Additional tasks include but are not limited to improving airflow and air distribution throughout the trailer.  <br>    <br>  INTENT OF THIS RFI:  The intent of this RFI is to collect responses from interested businesses to provide the upgrade of replacement of the current AVCATT ECU.  Capability statements will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research only.  The Government requests that all interested parties submit a response (not to exceed 15 pages) that provides a description of your capabilities, past experience in similar efforts, a rough order of magnitude (ROM) and a description of how you would approach the effort.  An Industry Day has currently not been scheduled for this effort, however it is anticipated that interested parties may be permitted to tour the AVCATT system at a to be determined date should it be warranted.  <br>     <br>  ACQUISITION APPROACH: The Government is currently developing an acquisition strategy for the AVCATT ECU Upgrade.  As the NAICS has not yet been confirmed, it is anticipated that the ECU's requirements may be fulfilled via full and open competition or via a delivery order under a Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.  The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  The contract type for this effort has not yet been determined.  Issues to be considered in the acquisition strategy for this effort include the following:  <br>    <br>  QUANTITIES:  <br>  	  <br>  The AVCATT program has identified the quantities for this effort to include the entire AVCATT fleet of 23 systems (46 trailers).  <br>    <br>  At the time of this writing, 19 systems are located within the Continental United States and four are located Outside of the Continental United States.   <br>    <br>  ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  TBD  <br>    <br>  RESPONSES REQUESTED: Firms interested in this potential procurement must provide their capability statement via email no later than 3:30pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 30 August 2013 to Michael Hickey, Contract Specialist, michael.a.hickey@us.army.mil and Lauren Bushika, Contract Specialist, lauren.bushika@us.army.mil.

The Secretary of Defense through Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 91-2 dated March 19, 1991, directed the Secretary of the Army to coordinate with the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force and with the heads of Defense Agencies to develop an integrated strategy for all Components within the service territory of each utility to coordinate activity and maximize savings. DEPPM 94-1, issued December 20, 1993, established the guidelines for participation in Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management (EC/DSM) programs offered by or to be negotiated with public utilities.  42 USC 8256 provides information relating to utility incentive programs. Four key elements of this section are highlighted below.  <br>    <br>    - Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities.  <br>    <br>    - Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from any such utility, to increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage electricity demand.  <br>    <br>    - Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized by such agency.  <br>    <br>    - If an agency satisfies the criteria that generally apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other incentives.  <br>    <br>  3. Description of the Requirement: A UESC is a contracting vehicle that allows agencies to accomplish energy savings projects for their facilities without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations to pay for the improvements. Under a UESC contract, the selected UESC utility provider (Utility) will provide their own funding, provide financed funding, or a combination of their own and financed funding, for an energy conservation project that will be repaid from utility bill savings. The Utility will conduct a comprehensive energy audit to identify improvements that will result in energy savings. With coordination and approval of the Government, the Utility will design and construct an energy savings project and provide assurance that the improvements will result in savings sufficient to pay for the project over a maximum 10-year repayment period. The Utility will also develop a savings assurance plan and arrange project financing. The project energy savings will be measured over the course of the financing period.   <br>    <br>  4. Project Information:  The requirement at the US Army Garrison Fort Campbell KY includes but is not limited to upgrading street/roadway lighting, upgrading residential walkway and entrance lighting (strategic interior areas), upgrading residential parking lot lighting, upgrading area lighting for storage or maintenance areas with nighttime activity (motor pools), and upgrading lighting at access and entry control points (main gates).  <br>    <br>  5.

<DESC>This notice is being posted in compliance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(2), within 14 days after placing an order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold supported by a limited-source justification. On March 18, 2014, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases issued a delivery order to Open Text, Inc. under HHSN272201300122U against Open Text's GSA Contract Number GS35F0480J. The period of performance for this task order is one year. This task order was issued under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized for the justification stated below:
<p>NIAID currently utilizes LiveLink software to support NIAID's Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS) initiative. The Adlib EXPRESS licenses sought as part of this purchase request are a third party module required for server-based document conversion ("publishing") within the enterprise electronic laboratory notebook system eNovator (KinMatik, Inc). The eNovator system is a component of the NIAID's enterprise document repository "LiveLink" sold and supported by Open Text Corporation. The LiveLink repository and modules within it are uniformly supported by Open Text Corporation, ensuring continuity of service and proper maintenance for the life of the repository. Because of the need for a single support route for all LiveLink-based systems and the way the Adlib EXPRESS package is bundled as a module integrating with the LiveLink system, we are required to use Open Text Corporation to provide the Adlib Express package. Open Text Corporation is the only available source that meets the requirements of this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION 
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	23 Christopher Way
     	Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
      		
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a Firm-Fixed-Price Delivery Order (DO) issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for renewal of RadiantLogic maintenance.  The period of performance for the maintenance and support shall be 12 months from April 9, 2014 to April 8, 2015 with three 12-month option periods. 

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is for the renewal of three Annual Maintenance and Support Premium subscriptions for RadiantLogic RadiantOne Virtual Director Server (VDS) Context Edition Production  licenses and two Annual Maintenance and Support Premium RadiantLogic RadiantOne VDS Context Edition-Non Production licenses.  The RadiantLogic RadiantOne VDS is a federated identity platform which enables authentication and fine-grained authorization for identity management and context-driven applications.  The VDS is designed specifically to solve data integration challenges for non-disruptive deployments in high-volume, high-complexity identity environments, without customization.  The RadiantLogic RadiantOne Premium Annual Maintenance and Support includes initial access to product upgrades, productivity enhancements, versions, releases, workarounds, bug fixes, and security/functional patches to licensed product(s).  This support shall be available via e-mail, web, phone and knowledge base to support maintenance and troubleshooting.
The contractor shall deliver premium annual maintenance and support services for the three RadiantLogic RadiantOne VDS production and for the two RadiantLogic RadiantOne VDS non-production software licenses.  
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized".

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph eight of this document, it was determined that limited competition is viable among resellers for this brand name requirement.  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  RadiantLogic or resellers of the brand name RadiantLogic can meet VA's requirements.  In April 2013, VA procured the original software licenses with associated maintenance and support.  The maintenance and support is due to expire on April 8, 2014.  The RadiantLogic RadiantOne VDS software is the only brand name product that can provide identity aggregation for lightweight, proxy-based integration, subsystem integration for homogeneous identity sources and complete integration for a fully integrated, merged system.  Furthermore, Specialized Access Control (SAC) service has been established to standardize and centralize the control of end-user access to VA systems, data, and other resources.  SAC is "fine-grained access control" that is tightly integrated with the "coarse-grained access control" provided by the Provisioning service.  Both the Provisioning and SAC services have been developed, tested and deployed using the RadiantLogic RadiantOne VDS brand name software licenses.  There are three RadiantLogic RadiantOne VDS software licenses already being used in production and two software licenses being used in development and testing.  Only RadiantLogic or authorized resellers can provide RadiantLogic's proprietary annual software maintenance services and support.  These software licenses require uninterrupted and ongoing maintenance and support.  Without fully operational RadiantLogic RadiantOne VDS software licenses, serious disruption will occur in the ability of a large user population to efficiently streamline and automate the granting and removing of electronic permissions to VA data, services, technology systems, and resources as well as to enforce both course and fine grain control policies.  Specifically, the negative impacts of this degradation in service include a reduction or suspension of the support services that will be experienced by current and planned provisioning and SAC customers which include Veterans, beneficiaries, employees, contractor affiliates, and internal VA users. 

Finally, the introduction of any brand name other than RadiantLogic will compromise the integrity of Veterans' authorizations that are enabled by the RadiantLogic RadiantOne VDS.  VA would need to reorganize, redesign and recode both the provisioning and SAC services.  The renewal of RadiantLogic RadiantOne VDS software licenses, maintenance services and support is vital to VA and to ensure RadiantOne VDS software remains secure, reliable, and fully supported.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  It was determined that limited competition is viable among resellers for this brand name effort. In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO) and the justification will be made publicly available.  The justification will be posted with the request for quotation on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.

 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying a brand name item, there are resellers of the required maintenance of these products on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.  Limited competition for this requirement among these vendors is anticipated.  Finally, in order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research so that other solutions can be considered.

8.  Market Research:  In December 2013, the Government's technical experts conducted market research to ascertain the ability of any other source, other than a RadiantLogic reseller, that can provide the aforementioned services.  It was confirmed that the software currently contains proprietary information and only RadiantLogic and its resellers can provide the annual software maintenance services and support.  While other sources possess general capabilities needed to provide similar services, no other source was found to meet VA's needs without access to the proprietary data.  Given that the RadiantLogic product is a proprietary solution, there are no other authorized vendors that can provide maintenance licenses without voiding the licenses currently in use.

Additional market research was conducted by utilizing the Product Verification tool on the NASA SEWP website.  The search identified six RadiantLogic resellers; one Value Added Reseller (VAR) and Computer System Original Equipment Manufacturer from Group A, one Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business VAR from Group B, three small business VARs (one which is no longer a small business) from Group C, and one large business VAR from Group D.  The market research demonstrates that adequate competition exists amongst RadiantLogic resellers on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
