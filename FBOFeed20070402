<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in public architecture, engineering, and construction through a design-build delivery method.  GSA intends to award one (1) firm-fixed price design-build contract for all design and construction services necessary to construct a new Federal building located on the grounds of the Anacostia Annex (formerly known as the Anacostia Naval Air Station) situated in southeast Washington, D.C.  The proposed site covers approximately 3.7 acres at the south end of the Anacostia Annex along its boundary with Bolling Air Force Base.  The completed project will meet or exceed all Federal design and construction statutes, standards, and regulations, including but not limited to the energy goals stated in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection measures.  The project will be designed in metric units and will be capable of achieving a LEED®-NC Silver rating.  The anticipated cost for the project is between $40,000,000 and $50,000,000, and will consist of one building containing approximately 10,572 square meters.  The building is intended to serve as a secure, stand alone facility capable of providing a safe environment for efficiently processing a high-volume of sensitive materials for delivery to a confidential end-user Government entity.  The facility will be designed and constructed in a manner that will enable the Government to accommodate future advances in processing procedures and techniques.  The facility will employ sophisticated systems controls, including an HVAC system that contains highly classified materials.  In addition, the facility will require various laboratory-like spaces. While the contractor’s personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e., TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.  The Government anticipates providing the design-build contractor with enhanced Concept Drawings upon contract award.  Preliminary approvals have been secured from National Capital Planning Commission and Commission of Fine Arts for the current design.  Additional submissions will be required to secure final approvals.  The design-build scope of work includes all architectural, engineering, construction, and other related services necessary to turn the Government’s enhanced Concept Drawings into a competed project.  The completed design will conform to GSA Design Excellence requirements.  Related services include, but are not limited to, site planning, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, archaeological monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, and commissioning.  GSA has engaged HDR Architecture, Inc. of Alexandria, Virginia, to assist in preparing project specific design criteria, finalizing the building program, and assisting with portions of the Design-Build solicitation.  GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price design-build contract pursuant to the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 36.3 and Subpart 15.  The procurement will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will be a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 will be a Request for Proposals (RFP).  During Phase 1, offerors will prepare and submit their qualifications as specified in the RFQ package which will be issued on or about April 16, 2007, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The evaluation factors for Phase 1 are as follows:   1)  Past Performance, 2)  Technical Approach, 3)  Specialized Experience and Technical Competency,  4)  Capability to Perform,  5)  Design Excellence.   Refer to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) package for details on the Phase 1 evaluation criteria and information for submittals. By late May 2007, the Government anticipates extending invitations to a maximum of five (5) of the most highly qualified offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals, which will be due around early August 2007.  The short listed firms will be issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) package and may undergo a presentation and review process under separate evaluation factors.  Details on the evaluation factors and submittals will be outlined in the RFP.  The Government anticipates making an award in September 2007.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52-219-19).  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses, is encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.

<DESC>The Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the provision of unarmed guard services for Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Belgium. 

SHAPE is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. SHAPE intends to use the one envelope bidding procedure. Partial bidding is not authorized.

The estimated total value of this project (6 months base period + 4 one-year options) is estimated to be Euro 4,500,000 ($6,000,000).

The IFIB (Invitation for International Bidding) package will contain material at the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED. The contractor personnel responsible for performing services under the contract, however, must be in possession of a valid NATO security clearance up to the level of NATO SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

The reference for this procurement is IFIB-ACO-SH-07-33 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement should include that reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

The contractor will provide unarmed guard services at SHAPE in accordance with Belgian law. 

Eligible firms must have performed at least three contracts within the past five years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation.  

SHAPE will mail the IFIB to all those on the bidders list and will also post the tender documents on the following website: www.nato.int/shape/community/budfin/index.htm

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

As provided for under MBC rules, nominations to the bidders list will continue to be accepted by the Host Nation after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Deadline for requesting Declaration of Eligibility from Department of Commerce: 17 April 2007

2. Estimated IFIB release date: May 2007

3. Estimated bid closing date: June 2007

NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC) in Silver Springs, Nevada under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 -Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NATC is one of only two test centers capable of performing the combination of specific corrosion event testing and full-scale vehicle durability testing, the other being the U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) at Aberdeen Proving Grounds which is currently funded as part of this program by the Office of Naval Research. This is a follow-on effort to contract N00014-02-C-0355 which was awarded by the Office of Naval Research and completed in FYO6. Award to another source would result in a duplication of Government cost and effort not expected to be recovered through a competitive procurement. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources submitting proposals within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward capabilities statements to the point of contact no later than 04/16/07. See note 22

<DESC>THIS IS A REPUBLICATION OF AN AD, DATED JUNE 29, 2006.  IF YOU PREVIOUSLY RESPONDED TO THE PRIOR AD AND HAVE NO CHANGES TO YOUR SUBMISSION, YOU NEED NOT RESPOND.

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a property in Northern Virginia under a lease that expires on April 1, 2008. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 593,100 rentable square feet of office and related space, including 1,014 secure parking spaces.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 539,183 ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet (previously referred to as usable). The space must be provided within one building or within a complex of no more than three neighboring buildings of similar construction and security.  The delineated area for this requirement is Northern Virginia.

The building(s) must be located outside of any 100-year floodplain and on a secure site incorporating a government-approved setback distance from other buildings and vehicular traffic.  The Government must be the only tenant in these buildings.  Proximity to a Metrorail station is required.  The building must meet Government standards for fire and life safety and accessibility. Space on the roof for antennae is required.  The space must be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  

 The lease term requirement is 10 years.  The space must be ready for occupancy by January  1, 2009.  The Government requires a fully serviced lease.

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing leased space or to relocate.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, relocation costs, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure and the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements all at once or over a one or two year phase-in period.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-07-10356, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-16. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 which has a $6.5 million dollar size standard, however, it is anticipated that the contract will be awarded as a result of full and open competition.  The purpose of this notice is to inform all interested parties that the Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price type contract as a result of this solicitation.  Background: EPA?s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) is responsible for certain statutory requirements regarding air pollution outlined by The Clean Air Act (CAA).  OAQPS maintains primary responsibility for guiding the nation?s air quality management and is responsible for developing programs to implement these standards.   Since publication of the NRC report Air Quality Management in the United States in January 2004, EPA has been working with a Federal Advisory Committee to develop recommendations to improve the nation?s air quality management system. In January 2005, the first set of recommendations was presented to EPA from the Committee. EPA expects a second set of recommendations to be presented in May 2007. The final report from the CAAAC will be finalized by June 2007.   The need for a multi-pollutant approach is highlighted in recommendations by the Air Quality Management Workgroup that encourage EPA to:  (1) take an integrated, multi-pollutant approach to mitigating most significant risks, (2) development an integrated program for criteria and hazardous air pollutants, (3) consider multi-pollutant controls in the standard setting process, and (4) promote and improve integrated, multi-pollutant monitoring.  Recently, OAQPS has begun emphasizing a multi-pollutant, sector-based approach to achieving additional air quality improvements.  OAQPS has also maintained a central role in developing and articulating public communication about these programs and providing priority research needs to EPA?s Office of Research and Development (ORD) and other organizations conducting air-quality-related research.   Purpose:   To assist OAQPS in these areas, the Contractor will provide multi-disciplinary expertise to conduct scientific and technical assessments of air pollution causes and impacts; analyze the implications of these assessments for national air quality management strategies; and provide, through reports and communications materials, recommendations for OAQPS programs, communications strategies, research priorities, policies, training and regulations.  The Contractor must have expert knowledge of technical, scientific, and policy issues regarding particulate matter (PM), criteria pollutants and the air quality challenges facing the nation.   The contractor will provide expertise in the following areas: air quality science, pollutant heath and welfare effects, legislative history, national and international air quality issues, including pollutant transport, communicating technical information to varied audiences including Congress, industry, environmental groups, academia, The National Academies, national and international science organizations, the air quality community, and the public.   In evaluating available information, performing science and policy assessments, and developing reports and deliverables, the Contractor will apply practices and methodologies currently accepted within EPA and/or the scientific community and, where needed, recommend improvements to such methodologies to meet specific project needs.  Contractor will perform the work specified in the following tasks.  The contractor will meet on a regular basis (at least bi-weekly) with OAQPS Policy and Communications staff to receive assignments under this task and to develop and implement its air quality program.    STATEMENT OF WORK: THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS:   Task 1: The contractor shall provide expert scientific and technical review and recommendations concerning strategies and activities directed at evaluating the multiple impacts of and evaluating multi-pollutant and sector based approaches by targeting reductions in those pollutants that have multiple public health impacts.  Specifically, the contractor shall perform the following tasks: 1.1  The contractor shall summarize and analyze OAQPS? current data needs and data flow, both within and from the organization, and provide written recommendations of steps that can be taken in the short term (1-2 years) and long term (3-5 years) to ensure that data is developed, presented and used in a manner that facilitates cross program integration and optimizes collateral benefits to the fullest extent possible. 1.2  The contractor shall review the list of 188 air toxics and recommend which compounds are also PM-2.5 precursors or direct emissions of carbon based PM-2.5.  The recommended list shall be supported with the latest technical information including but not limited to, scientific literature citations, expert interviews.  Deliverables:  1.1  One electronic copy and one hard copy of report providing a written assessment addressing each of the following topics:   a.  Current data bases and informational sources maintained by OAQPS including an analysis of how the information is being, and can be, used across the programs and OAQPS divisions in support of multi-pollutant strategies.  b.  Gaps in the data and information necessary to integrate emission reduction across the criteria and toxic air pollutant programs in a manner supportive of multi-pollutant and sector based approaches to air quality management.   c. Recommendations of short- and long-term steps to fill data and information gaps in support of multi-pollutant and sector based approaches to air quality management.   Delivered by 8 months from contract effective date. 1.2  One electronic copy and one hard copy of written report providing EPA with recommendations and supporting documentation.  Delivered by 11.5 months from contract effective date. TASK 2:  Review of Communication Strategies, and Communications Materials; Scientific Review of OAQPS Papers for Publication: The contractor shall ensure that the strategies and communications materials for OAQPS programs include background information necessary to provide an appropriate scientific and historical context.  This may include overviews of EPA programs and associated rules, as well as a historical perspective on program development, including legislative history, if relevant. The contractor shall include explanations, appropriate to a given audience, of the science behind the program, rule or issue. 2.1 The contractor shall review and provide comment to improve strategies for communicating to a range of audiences the technical, historical and scientific aspects of OAQPS air quality programs, rules and issues (programs). The list of OAQPS programs includes regional haze, particle pollution, air toxics, long-range transport, and other air quality-related issues.  2.2  The contractor shall review and provide recommendations to improve the scientific and historical content of communications materials for OAQPS air quality programs.  Communication materials include: briefings, including graphical representations of technical information, web presentations, fact sheets, talking points, questions and answers, and desk statements.  OAQPS programs include regional haze, particle pollution, air toxics, long-range transport, and other air quality-related issues.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command will be soliciting a proposal for support of In Service Support of the F/A18 aircraft for both USN and FMS countries with the Boeing Company.  The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company (MDC/Boeing) will be solicited for this requirement via the F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Team (FIRST) program.  This effort will include program management, in-service engineering, integrated logistics support management, continual assessment of life cycle logistics support, training system management, configuration management, supply support requirements and analysis, technical publications, modifications/retrofit, and support equipment/ILS and management.

The FIRST Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract currently provides spares availability, asset repair management, engineering support, and integrated logistics support (ILS) of all F/A-18 Aircraft variants. The FIRST program demands aggressive pursuit of system reliability improvements through effective configuration and obsolescence management, technology insertion, and innovative product and support improvements. Various operational and repair sites are supported. Additionally, MDC/Boeing is also required to maintain CORE capability I/A/W U.S. Code 10 U.S.C 2464 through depot teaming arrangements with the NADEPs in North Island, Cherry Point, and Jacksonville under FIRST. 

This requirement is restricted to MDC/Boeing, the aircraft prime manufacturer, because MDC/Boeing is the only source that possesses the full range of technical data, much of which is proprietary, and other capabilities necessary to perform the effort. Further, MDC/Boeing is considered to be the only source that is capable of providing the required range of integrated program support. See Note 22*****

<DESC>Requisition 1028076 (Modification #2 HHSF223200610464P)

Professional Services Contract

Contracting Office Address
Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2129, Rockville, MD, 20857-0001

Period of Performance (UNCHANGED from MODIFICATION 1)
February 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007

Contractor
Henry T. Heaton, II
Address: 21116 Black Rock Road, Hagerstown, MD  21740

Description
This is a modification to a previous Sole Source Award for a noncommercial item. This announcement constitutes the only notification of such changes.  Due to the changes in the Statement of Work and the additional funding, these changes are being published on FEDBIZOPS.  The solicitation number is R1028076. The Government plans to modify the Firm Fixed Purchase Order.

Original Sole Source Justification

Dr. Thomas Henry Heaton is a former CDRH Calibration Laboratory Manager and current NVLAP Auditor, and has knowledge of all aspects of the laboratory.  This expertise is critical for transitioning to the White Oak Facility and preparing for an Audit by NIST’s National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program within the desired timeframe.  

Amended Sole Source Justification

The proposed contractor is a former CDRH Calibration Laboratory Manager and current NVLAP Auditor, and has extensive knowledge of all aspects of the laboratory.  This expertise is critical for transitioning to the White Oak Facility and preparing for an Audit by the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program within the desired timeframe.  

Dr. Heaton is an expert in dosimetry and the calibration of radioactive sources.  He has performed research in the area and has written many papers on these topics.  Dr. Heaton’s help and assistance with dosimetry and calibration issues in this program will have a great impact on the safety of the public health.

Professional Services Contract Modification
This is a modification to the original statement of work.  As stated in the previous statement, Dr. Heaton has been working on a project intended to provide the Division of Reproductive, Abdominal and Radiological Devices (DRARD) with advanced technical expertise in the radiation therapy area.  This expertise is not available in the Center. DRARD is required to provide credible reviews of various radiation therapy submissions and without support, the program would be significantly hampered. 

The work, expertise and background of Dr. Heaton in these areas uniquely qualify him to address specific issues associated with the radiation therapy product line.  He will contribute greatly to the medical device review process and to the various matters that are critical to the safety of the public.  Without this support, the Division would be placed at a disadvantage in completing its mission. The Center will be pressed for time and might find it impossible to provide knowledgeable reviews of many radiation therapy products including the completion of this dosimetry and calibration project.  The result will be the marketing of radiation therapy devices of uncertain safety and effectiveness and the potential for an increased number of adverse results from the use of these devices.

Revised Statement of Work

The primary purpose of this contract modification is to allow Dr. Heaton the ability to provide technical support to the CDRH Calibration Laboratory Project due to the Center’s move to the White Oak Campus.  This part of the project has become more involved and it was determined that someone with a background in calibration and dosimetry was needed.  In identifying this project and need, scientific and technical support will be provided in the following areas:

* Reestablishing and validating the calibration ranges
* Updating the Calibration Quality Manual to reflect the White Oak Facility move and the ISO 17025 format.
* Technical support and recommendations for improvement of overall Quality System to prepare for NVLAP Audit at the new facility

This project will be completed in three phases.  They include:

Phase 1 

Revise and update Calibration Laboratory Quality Manual to be consistent with the requirements in ISO 17025 and NIST Handbook 150 which is necessary for continued National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation (NVLAP) accreditation of the CDRH X-ray Calibration Laboratory.

Phase 2

Provide guidance, technical assistance, and direction on the measurements necessary to characterize the operational aspects of the CDRH X-ray Calibration Laboratory after the move to the White Oak campus.  This includes the measurements necessary to understand the factors that impact calibration of instruments used by FDA inspectors in various compliance programs in x-ray beams from diagnostic and mammographic quality beams and how to account for these influencing quantities in the calibration process.

Phase 3

Document the measurements used to characterize the new CDRH X-ray Calibration Laboratory and the associated calibration procedures employed to calibrate various types of instruments.  Update and document the uncertainty analysis to reflect the calibration laboratory at the new White Oak campus.

Benefits to the Organization

This contract would support the retention of the CDRH Laboratory’s accredited status through the National Institute for Standards and Technology’s (NIST) National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program and conformance to the ISO/IEC Standard 17025.  This laboratory allows the CDRH to fulfill its responsibilities for monitoring the safety of electronic products that emit potentially hazardous levels of radiation.   

IRML is continuing to work with OCER in developing a plan to phase out instrument calibration service while maintaining “for cause” measurement capabilities.  The laboratory provides expertise for quantifying radiation emissions from emerging technologies and new products. The laboratory also provides expertise for the development of voluntary standards and guidance documents aimed at limiting the public’s exposure to non-medical x-radiation.

Deliverables

1) Dr. Heaton will be able to develop a Calibration Laboratory Quality Manual in the following formats (order of preference): WORD, PDF, HTML
2) Place the manual on the appropriate media storage device (DVD, CD, and Computer System).

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/U.S. Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) is the Armys premier integrator of space and missile defense capabilities and, as such, has been directed to deliver assigned Army capabilities acro ss the full spectrum of warfare from concept to warfighter.   In support of air, space, and missile defense, the USASMDC/ARSTRAT executes a requirement to fulfill advisory and assistance services under the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance Contr acts (SETAC) program.  The contractor will be expected to provide non-personal services for systems engineering and technical assistance in support of the Mission and Function Statements for the USASMDC/ARSTRAT and Other Government Agencies related to air,  space, and/or missile defense.  This support is both broad ranging and ever changing.  The SETAC scope of work (SOW) is anticipated to have ten (10) functional areas:  (1) Requirements Definition, Integration, and Planning; (2) Technology Development, Sys tem Development, Assessment, and Validation; (3) Threat Estimation/Projections; (4) Weapons Lethality and Effects Estimation; (5) Modeling, Simulation and Interfacing; (6) Program/Project Analysis, Evaluation, Experimentation, and Support; (7) Production a nd Fielding Support; (8) Homeland Defense and Homeland Security; (9) Warfighter Support; and 10) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear. The anticipated competition will allow for seven Awards: 2 Reserved for Woman-Owned Small Business; 1 Reserved for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; 1 Reserved for 8(a) Business; 2 Reserved for Small Business; and 1 Full and Open without Reser vation.  The government reserves the right to adjust the reservations based on the outcome of the Sources Sought Validation. This acquisition will result in multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts with identical SOWs and numbers of Direct Productive Person-Hours (DPPHs).  The contracts will consist of fixed-price labor categories and cost reimbur sable travel and materials line items.   The period of performance for the resultant acquisition will be a five (5)-year Basic contract and there will be an option provision for the possibility of five (5) one-year extensions to the basic period of performance.  The Government is planning to incl ude five (5) one-year options in the event that the statutory language preventing advisory and assistance services (A&AS) contracts from exceeding five years is revised within the basic contract period of performance. It is anticipated that the requirement s will be executed via task orders issued, based on actual customer requirements.  The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other SMDC contract. To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Governments interests , the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractors actual performance.	 The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541710/1000 employees.  This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The expected release date of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is on or about 20 Apri l 2007.

<DESC>This modification is to reflect an increase in scope to include PCA tooling.  NAVAIR NAWCAD Lakehurst now intends to enter into a sole source delivery order with the Bell-Boeing JPO (BBJPO) for the procurement of the design, development, testing and manufacture of 81 unique items of Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) and associated supportability data to support the depot level of maintenance of the Pylon Conversion Actuator (PCA) at NADEP Cherry Point. The BBJPO shall deliver these PCA tools as well as associated logistics support, end item spares, technical manuals, calibration, and associated data.  The Navy does not own specifications, drawings, and related data to permit full and open competition.   BBJPO, the designer, developer, and integrator of the V-22 Aircraft Weapons System, is the original manufacturer of the V-22 aircraft and remains the only business entity that has all the required proprietary rights and non disclosure agreements with the suppliers of the aircraft components that are necessary to design, develop, and manufacture the Organizational, Intermediate, and Depot Level PSE.  The Government intends to procure this equipment under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which may be considered by the Government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

“Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation.  If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.

However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  In order to select the winning proposal, EOUSA will rank each offeror by making a series of paired comparisons between them, trading off the marginal differences in capability with the marginal difference in price.  

This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set Aside.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 561492.  In order to be considered a small business under this NAICS code, your average annual receipts must not exceed $6.5 million.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SSA-RFI-07-03-19
<RESPDATE>041107
<ARCHDATE>04112007
<CONTACT>Rick Bolt, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-966-8765, Fax 410-966-9310, Email rick.bolt@ssa.gov
<DESC>The closing date for this RFI has been extended one week to April 11, 2007.

The following is questions and answers received by interested vendors:

1. Clarify whether the software is required to both scan and classify/extract data from the documents, or only for software to classify/extract data from documents already scanned.  Only classify/extract data from documents already scanned.

2. If scanning is required, will scanners be required?   Not required.  There are existing scan workstations in ODAR that are part of the SSA Front End Capture System (FECS) which are used for manually scanning documents into DMA.
a.If so, how many?
b.If not, provide information on scanners to be used?

3. In 2003, SSA awarded an imaging software contract to QFI for Kofax's Capture software for the Social Security Administration's requirement to support the Agency's initiative to improve the disability claims process by providing scanning software at DDS offices. Is this RFI for a new and different solution?  No, the current scanning environment at SSA will remain.  Are the 145 hearing offices using the same imaging software that is available to the DDS offices?  Yes. If the hearing offices are using the Kofax capture software, does the software requested in this RFI need to integrate with the Kofax software? The proposed solution will need to integrate into the existing eDIB architecture, not as a standalone service, product or technology.  The system and process interfaces have not been defined at this time.  However, components of the eDib architecture include WebSphere MQ messaging, XML, and Web Services, and the SSA Intranet.  Proficiency in these and similar technologies is beneficial as we explore the best options.  SSA envisions the technology implemented as a callable software module, HTTP call, or Web Service through the eDib architecture.  The technology may or may not be implemented on SSA hardware and it should be noted that the solution should be architected so that it can be used to support a variety of SSA business processes outside of Disability. 

4. In 2004, Panacea Consulting was awarded a contract for the Social Security Administration's requirement for document scanning services to support the Agency's initiative to improve the disability claims process. This contract required document analysis, document separation, classification, and metadata extraction after scanning documents for FO’s, DDS's and hearing offices. How does this RFI relate to the documents being scanned for this contract?  The Panacea contract is no longer in place.  The current scanning Blanked Purchase Agreement (BPA) is with Lockheed Martin (LM).  The objective of this BPA is for the contractor to digitally image paper medical and non-medical evidence and provide related activities, including data transmission and electronic and paper document control.  There is no correlation between this RFI and the documents being scanned under the BPA.

5. Why does SSA desire to deploy the technology to the 145 hearing offices?  Would a centralized technology at the SSA headquarters be just as acceptable? SSA currently has 145 different sites throughout the country under the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR) responsible for holding hearings and issuing decisions as part of the Social Security Administration. The business process requires that the 145 hearing offices be able to perform these tasks locally.  These sites have immediate need for this technology; however, other SSA sites, both Disability and Non-Disability related, may be considered for use of this technology in the future.  It’s SSA’s preference to centralize the deployment and operation of this technology to the extent it is feasible.  If it is more feasible, for reasons of performance, cost, maintenance, usability, etc., to decentralize the technology, the vendor should clearly make their case for this position.  

6. What is the available bandwidth between the location that is performing, or would like to perform image analysis and the location that will be the repository? The amount of available bandwidth varies from site to site is based upon workload.  According to SSA’s network operations center (DNNSO), most ODAR sites implemented between one and two T-1s between their site and SSA’s National Computing Center (NCC).  The ODAR site in Falls Church, VA has the largest bandwidth with 5 T-1s. It must be assumed that the full bandwidth is not available. (DH)

7. In what capacity does the software need to integrate with their SSA Electronic Folder API?   (Page 2, § before last)  The software must be able return the results of its document analysis and data extraction as structured data in a format of SSA's choosing.  

8. In what capacity does the software need to integrate with, or the images to be viewed through the API?   (Page 3, first §)  The viewing of the documents will be done through an existing SSA application. The software must be able return the results of its document analysis and data extraction as structured data in a format of SSA's. 

9. Is data correction on OCR extraction results desired? Yes.  ODAR employees need the ability to correct the data that is extracted. We would not want or need the contractor to make any data correction.   Will this be handled remotely at the hearing office? This correction of the data will be handled at the hearing offices.   If remotely, how many validation clients would you need? How many validation clients needed would depend on what a validation client does.  If it allows the employee to edit the data extracted from OCR, then we would need to have that on every PC in the hearing offices which is approximately 10,000 PCs.  Assume dedicated licensing (not shared). If data validation is done centrally at SSA, how many validation clients would you need? We do not envision that this type of editing would be done centrally—only in the hearing offices.  If you want to do both remote and central data validation, how many clients would you need? This type of editing would only be performed at a hearing office.

10. Are the fields to be extracted limited to the structured forms, or both structured and free form documents?  Fields to be extracted are both structured and free form documents.  Is the handprint limited to the treatment date? The handprint is not limited to the treatment date.   If the treatment date can not be OCR’d with current hand writing technology, what other data does SSA believe can be used to organize documents? It will be necessary for human intervention to take place.  The ODAR employee will continue doing what they have been doing in the paper world and determine what the data is and record it.   Is this data machine print? The data is sometimes machine print.  It varies greatly depending on how electronic the medical communities are.

Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as key components of the Department’s networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) has undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.    The requirement will be set-aside for GSA schedule holders only.  GSA has already determined the prices to be fair and reasonable.  The Government will award a delivery order to the offer that represents the overall best value.<BR><BR>

8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:
A)	Background

Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 55 million, and dozens of ethnic groups, the five new nations of the region are addressing a range of challenges, including the aftermath of a civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, and the lack of strong democratic institutions.  The region is considered a Foreign Service hardship post ? 30% post differential for Tashkent, Uzbekistan. 

USAID?s Regional Mission for Central Asia (?USAID/CAR?) is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. Ambassadors in the region, for the design and the management of USAID assistance programs.  The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with offices in Astana, Kazakhstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  USAID/CAR is responsible for approximately $90 million of assistance annually, with activities totaling $400 million in the areas of energy and environment, economics and finance, democracy, and health and education.  The Mission works in partnership with over 70 grantee and contractors throughout the region.  The Uzbekistan Country Office (UCO) in Tashkent, led by the Country Representative, includes a team of 1 USDH, 2 USPSCs, and 11 local national technical and administrative support staff.   

B. BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSTION

The USPSC Development Assistance Specialist is located in the USAID/CAR/Tashkent office. Under the dual supervision of the USAID/CAR/Tashkent Country Representative and the USAID/CAR Democracy and Conflict Mitigation Office Director based in Almaty, Kazakhstan, the employee manages a range of development programs implemented in Uzbekistan. The Development Assistance Specialist is a member of the senior management team for the Uzbek Country Office; as such he/she may provide technical expertise and management assistance to the Country Representative as necessary.  The work of the Development Assistance Specialist involves a full range of project design, activity monitoring, grant management, data collection, political analysis, and program evaluation in various sectors in Uzbekistan.

The Development Assistance Specialist is responsible for monitoring a range of USAID/CAR/Uzbekistan initiatives in the areas of Peace and Security and Governing Justly and Democratically. As such, the employee must have considerable knowledge of political developments in the region, a background in democracy and community development programming, and must be effective in developing cooperative working relationships with American NGOs, local non-governmental partners, and government officials in Uzbekistan.  Moreover, s/he will work closely with and coordinate USAID/CAR?s democracy programs with the U.S. Embassy and other USG funded activities such as those funded by the U.S. Department of State?s Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Bureau (DRL).  

Due to the nature of this position, the Development Assistance Specialist must be able to think and operate strategically and programmatically, analyze complex situations in order to assist in the development of USAID strategic plans, and assess the impact of host country policies and practices on USAID programs.  While this position is based in Tashkent, the Development Assistance Specialist is expected to travel to program sites throughout Uzbekistan.  S/he may spend up to one-third of her/his time traveling throughout Uzbekistan.  

C. MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

Under the guidance of the USAID/CAR/Tashkent Country Representative and technical supervision of the Democracy and Conflict Mitigation Office Director, the Development Assistance Specialist monitors and reports on the progress of a range of development activities which are underway in Uzbekistan.  S/he identifies barriers to program implementation and success, and develops solutions to maximize program impact.  The Development Assistance Specialist will work collaboratively with the Democracy and Conflict Mitigation technical staff in Almaty to ensure program activities are implemented effectively.  This individual is expected to track and analyze political issues crucial for the successful implementation of activities in Uzbekistan.  The Development Assistance Specialist provides strategic vision for Peace and Security and Governing Justly and Democratically programs in Uzbekistan, continually honing USAID?s strategy and approach to ensure program are appropriate given local conditions, developments and opportunities.  

Based on thorough understanding and analysis of developments in Uzbekistan, the Development Assistance Specialist suggests new and/or changes to existing programs and activities.  S/he may develop program goals and objectives, and prepare scopes of work for new activities, project assessments, and/or evaluations in Uzbekistan.  The Development Assistance Specialist drafts program review documents describing USAID/CAR?s  activities in Uzbekistan, highlighting program impact achieved, and describing future plans and activities. 

S/he drafts program updates, reporting cables and other informational documents on USAID?s assistance in Uzbekistan.  Additionally, the Development Assistance Specialist serves as site officer, develops potential site visits, prepares briefing documents for, and briefs high level visitors such as Congressional Delegations, State Department and USAID Representatives, on USAID/CAR?s activities in Uzbekistan. 

The Development Assistance Specialist is expected to report, along with the Country Representative, on the performance of USAID/CAR activities to Embassy officials.  S/he serves as USAID/CAR representative on the U.S. Embassy Democracy Commission and coordinates USAID/CAR?s activities with other U.S. Government agencies, especially the Public Affairs Section of the Embassy and the State Department?s Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Bureau (DRL). 

The Development Assistance Specialist may serve as the acting Country Representative when the Country Representative is absent.    In this capacity, s/he:  (1) represents the Country Office on U.S. Embassy and other interagency committees (selection committees, etc.) which would otherwise require participation of the Country Representative; (2) represents USAID in donor and other meetings, as requested by the Country Representative; (3) gives input as necessary and report major conclusions to the responsible Activity Managers and ensures that all follow-up actions from these meetings are tracked; (4) maintains active knowledge of other donor activities which relate to the USAID portfolio and advises the Country Representative and USAID/CAR offices of opportunities for coordination; and (5) drafts English language materials such as talking points, scene setters and public relations material relevant to the overall development portfolio in Uzbekistan.   

Consistent with the overall Mission strategy, the incumbent independently cultivates/maintains contacts and dialogue with local counterparts including non-governmental organizations (NGO) in Uzbekistan. These contacts and dialogues will be used by the employee to effectively provide input for programming assistance. However, the incumbent will have no independent authority to commit U.S. Government Mission funds on behalf of USAID/CAR.

The Development Assistance Specialist may be assigned other duties as required by the USAID/CAR/Tashkent Country Representative and/or the Democracy and Conflict Mitigation Office Director.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE/Request For Information (RFI).  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 10.002(iii) the U.S. Coast Guard is conducting Market Research to identify commercially available sources that can provide Corrosion Mapping and Engineering Analysis Services.   This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is  NOT  a solicitation or a Request For Proposals (RFP).   Because this is not a solicitation, nor an RFP, phone calls and correspondence requesting that information submitted in response to this notice be evaluated and considered for contract award at this point will not be honored.   No contract will be awarded from this notice.   Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resulting future solicitation.  All submitted materials will be designated For Government Use Only.  

The Aging Aircraft Branch at the US Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) in Elizabeth City, NC is searching for sources that can respond in writing within 30 days of this announcement.  The major goal of this Corrosion Mapping and Engineering Analytical Services synopsis is to improve mission readiness, reduce operating & maintenance costs and consolidate legacy data into an intuitively integrated online site from which end users can expand their knowledge base. A desire of any Corrosion Mapping and Engineering Analysis Services Contract is to combine as many of the stated specifications under one vendor as possible, however, vendors are invited to respond even though they may not be able provide all stated services, especially if they are strong in one particular area.  The following is the specification for  Corrosion Mapping and Engineering Analysis Services: 

Provide wireless hardware tool(s) to include the interfacing software that can be used to electronically capture the location(s) of corrosion or structural damage found on aircraft at depot (USCG ARSC, Elizabeth City NC).  Additionally the hardware solution(s) should provide the mapper with the necessary location display information (i.e. cards, grids, diagrams) to select the extent or stage of corrosion (i.e. mild, minor, or major) and the type (exfoliation, fretting, galvanic, crack, etc…) of corrosion or damage.  The reference system to pin point the location should be easily retrieved and intuitively understood by the mapper.  The hardware used by the depot personnel to “map” the damage found should be ruggedized, reliable, cost effective and easily transportable and interoperable with all airframe types or users.  In the event digital images are necessary to further document the damage, the hardware tool(s) will have this capability to capture photos electronically (Note:  Ease of use will be heavily weighed in selecting a source during a source selection process).  The hardware should have the capability to readily download the information to a mapping database.  The hardware and software recommended should be chosen with the understanding of the goal to have a future capability to retrieve corrosion and repair data from all air stations through existing legacy Aviation Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS) channels to include Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) and Electronic Aircraft Logbook (EAL) as well as being able to dispense the proposed solution to the field units.  

Provide a readily available Corrosion Mapping Online Integrated Database that should be capable to assist the user with generating applicable text reports and present mapping data pictorially in either 2D or 3D active system diagrams.  The database should have a “dashboard-like” menu from which the user can select a host of options to include but not limited to the aircraft type, model, tail number, unit, date range(s) and type of damage.  The system should foster intuitive navigation and provide example damage and degree of damage imagery, be user friendly and have a reference schema to quickly identify the location of the damage to the degree of detail the user (maintainer, engineer, operator, manager) requires.  The system should permit the display of corrosion “hot spots” on individual aircraft; identification of the type and extent (depth, area, orientation, crack length) of corrosion or damage found; capability to display embedded images; historical engineering disposition information; the ability to query the database to view damage found on individual aircraft with rollup capability and/or the ability to request summary information for air station aircraft (i.e. all Coast Guard Air Station Miami H65 helicopters); capture corrosion mapping (data collection) man-hours devoted to individual depot aircraft; capture corrective man-hours to repair corrosion or accidental damage; and the architecture to expand mapping to include capturing non-destructive inspection log results and wiring damage along with capturing repairs in specific locations on aircraft.  The menu should be capable of retrieving legacy data to include text from ALMIS, ACMS, and EAL.  The menu should allow the selection and identification of the corrosion critical areas to include identification of primary, secondary and tertiary structure.  The menu should have the capability to build integrated links to individual aircrafts’ Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPBs) and Structural Repair Manuals (SRMs); links to individual aircraft’s Significant Component History Reports (SCHRs) found in the current legacy ACMS; links to the legacy Engineering Service Request (ESR) Database; links to ALMIS, ACMS and EAL; and links to individual platforms’ Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) data and inspection results.  The menu should also provide the expanded capability to include incorporating environmental severity data, dehumidification hours employed on a particular aircraft, collate impact of the number of rescue swimmer deployments to corrosion detected & mapped, and the number of day’s aircraft are deployed from home unit.  

Provide engineering analytical services to augment current resources within the Aging Aircraft Branch to support the Product Lines and field units to make sound recommendations for determining casual factors, prevention, material improvements, and repair vs. replace decisions as well as integrating all degraders into a decision matrix to make the most cost effective recommendation for the asset or component.    The USCG will allow offerors to propose either web based services or onsite services with the final determination resting with the USCG in the source selection process.

Note:  Current historical mapping data contained within ALMIS is desired to remain retrievable and ultimately incorporated into this new corrosion integrated database provided it can be accomplished in a cost-effective manner.  The data collection hardware and this database should be designed to provide essential information and tools required for the management of the Coast Guard fleet of aircraft.  Following review of the responses and prior to issuance of a solicitation/Request For Proposals (RFP), the Aging Aircraft Branch plans to hold a pre-solicitation conference sometime before the end of May 2007.

Interested companies are encouraged to respond to this announcement as soon as possible.  Responses should include a) name and address of contractor; b) Cage Code; c) point of contact including name, title, phone, and email address; d) descriptive literature, brochures, price ranges and should include if services are of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace, of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace with modifications, or used exclusively for governmental purposes; e) state whether the business is currently classified as Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), HubZone Small Business, Women Owned, Veteran Owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small business in terms of the NAICS code; f) GSA Contract information if applicable, and other information that provides the Coast Guard with a more accurate picture of the potential marketplace for any subsequent requirement.  The NAICS code is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4.0 mil.  Responses should be submitted to  AVI2 Erick Ludwigson at Erick.J.Ludwigson @uscg.mil or Denise Hall, Contract Specialist, at  Denise.P.Hall@uscg.mil., or faxed to  (252)334-5242 or mail to USCG AR&SC, Attn: Denise Hall, EISD Bldg 78, Elizabeth City, NC 27909.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. The Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment of Class 3 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) ensembles when used by first responders in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or other hazardous environments.

The CDP is inviting manufacturers to provide information on Class 3 PPE ensembles meeting NFPA 1994 standards and NIOSH certification as of 15 March 2007. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Authorized Equipment List (AEL) item number for this equipment is 1.2.3.1. The requested information will be included in the Class 3 PPE market research, will provide available product information, and will provide support information for the CDP PPE focus group and assessment. By providing information in response to this RFI, you agree that the System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program may use both the equipment information and any provided images in SAVER outreach.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security established the System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program to assist emergency responders making procurement decisions. The SAVER Program conducts unbiased operational tests on commercial equipment and systems, and provides those results along with other relevant equipment information to the community in an operationally useful form. SAVER provides information on equipment that falls within the categories listed in the DHS AEL. Information related to the SAVER Program may be viewed at https://www.dhs-saver.Info/Default.aspx

The intent of the user assessment program will be to provide the emergency response community with feedback on equipment based on utilization in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that will be experienced in incident response. The results of the assessment will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the CDP endorse any product or manufacturer.

The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of all disciplines of agencies and jurisdictions across the US. These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field. The evaluators will be presented with specific scenarios and tasks to be carried out while wearing the ensembles. The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator. Some of the criteria could include capability, usability, affordability, deployability, and maintainability.

If you wish to provide information about your particular brand/product, please provide, in electronic (MS Word) format, your company name; whether you are a manufacturer or a distributor; address; point of contact; telephone number; fax number; web address; and e-mail address. Additionally, please provide any information available such as the adaptability of the equipment in hazardous environments, reliability, maintainability, durability, environmental limits, safety reports, latest research, and new developments.

<SUBJECT>D -- Windows Development Production Environment
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SSA-RFI-07-1003
<RESPDATE>041607
<ARCHDATE>05012007
<CONTACT>Jessica Coombs, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-597-1959, Fax 410-965-9560, Email jessica.coombs@ssa.gov - Jane Quinn, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109659588, Fax 4109659560, Email jane.quinn@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) currently operates a large enterprise-level Development and Production Environment (DPE) for SSA’s computer applications that are hosted on IBM mainframe computers running the IBM z/OS operating system and Sun Microsystems computers running the Solaris Unix operating system.  SSA’s DPE consists of six separate environments—each configured with hardware, software, data and procedures necessary for an application to transition from one environment in the DPE to another.  

At SSA, a computer application can be viewed as transitioning through the following six environments:

1.	Pre-Development—This is a separate environment for testing new versions of (or major changes to) the operating system and essential infrastructure software (systems software, system management tools, developer and System Development Life Cycle support tools, etc.) prior to their implementation in the Development environment.  Pre-development testing is performed by SSA personnel and contractors who report to SSA’s centralized IT development support component.   
2.	Development—This is the environment in which developers create or modify an application and then perform unit and team testing on that application.  Development testing continues until the application is ready for Validation testing (i.e., is stable and provides the target functionality for the current application release).  Development testing is performed by SSA personnel and contractors who report to SSA’s centralized IT application development and SSA’s centralized IT development support components.
3.	Validation—This is the environment where an application is subjected to testing by independent (non developer) groups in SSA’s centralized IT application and IT support components such as: specialized testing teams, requirements analysts, and by select end user representatives.  Validation testing is intended to verify that the functional requirements for this release of the application are met and there are no adverse effects.  SSA’s Validation environments do not generally support stress testing.  
4.	Integration—This is the environment where an application is subjected to integration testing in a production like environment.  The integration tests are performed by independent testers who report to SSA’s production data center component.  The integration testing environment is focused on testing applications with production versions of infrastructure software and other applications that will co-exist with the subject application in the production environment.  This is to ensure that the subject application software:

a.	Runs normally (does not crash/abend) and produces expected outputs.  This  includes its interactions with other transactions and/or associated batch work 
b.	Can co-exist with other applications in the shared application server target environment, an example from the J2EE environment is that the application uses the standard Java Runtime Environment. 
c.	In appropriate situations, will process data at projected transaction throughput rates (this may involve stress testing of the application). 

5.	Training—This is a separate environment where end users learn how to use an application prior to implementing it in a production environment.  It is used when major new applications or major modifications to existing applications make it advisable to deploy an application that has passed through integration testing in a pre-production environment for hands-on end user training prior to going into the production environment.  
6.	Production—This is the target “live” environment for all application development efforts where an application will be hosted with full scale data center 24x7 support, service level agreements, etc.

Each of the above six environments is supported with the hardware, software, data, procedures and staff personnel that are necessary for SSA’s applications to progress through the life-cycle steps associated with that environment.  In addition, each environment includes procedures that identify the steps that need to be performed for an application to transition from that environment to the next environment.

Although SSA has a structured DPE, SSA does not currently have such an environment set up for the development, testing and operation of its computer applications, relative to these applications being hosted on an x86 or Itanium2 server system platform running the Microsoft’s Windows Server operating system.  At this time, SSA is considering the feasibility of operating an enterprise-level Windows Development and Production Environment (WDPE)—with the same operational and management process as is currently being used within the DPE computing infrastructure—adding a 3rd enterprise development and production environment to SSA’s existing mainframe and UNIX system infrastructure.  This Windows/x86 or Windows/Itanium2 WDPE is being considered for production class deployment of both select COTS, as well as SSA custom developed or modified applications. 

As with the current DPE, it is expected that the WDPE will consist of a sequence of environments—each configured with the hardware, software, data and procedures that are necessary for a Windows Server based application to transition from one environment to the next.  Initially this environment will be used to develop, validate, integrate, performance test and host:

1.	COTS applications of a departmental scope which require full data center support – monitoring, Service Level Objectives, backup and recovery, business continuity, integration with enterprise security.
2.	COTS applications which are enterprise level in scope.  SSA does not expect that applications which are the most demanding in terms of scalability, criticality (Core applications) or reliability will initially be hosted in the Windows Environment, but that SSA will grow towards that capability over a period of several years.
3.	COTS packages or applications developed by SSA employees or contractors which support application development (SDLC support tools).
4.	Applications developed by SSA personnel or contractors which need to access other production data, be integrated with enterprise security and require full data center support.

SSA is seeking a vendor who is familiar with highly scalable enterprise DPEs that has experience in defining, planning, developing and implementing highly scalable centralized WDPEs in geographically dispersed organizations with large numbers of end users.  SSA has approximately 65,000 personnel in its District Office and Disability Determination Service locations, most of whom interact with SSA’s production applications on a daily basis and continuously throughout their working day Additionally, it should be noted that some of the developers who will use the WDPE will be in distributed locations across our nationwide network. 

Service Areas

In particular, SSA is looking for vendors that will be able to provide the following services to SSA:

1.	Appropriately identifying the hardware systems architecture for each environment in the WDPE.  This will include, but not be limited to identifying/ recommending:

SSA’s Current Centralized (Departmental) Windows Application Hosting Environment 

This information is presented only to give a frame of reference to SSA’s current Windows application environment.  SSA’s current centralized Windows application hosting environment supports applications of a departmental nature.  Business unit or IT development teams deploy applications to this environment directly, without benefit of a formal SDLC process.  This environment is not considered an enterprise class production environment (not 24/7 data center support, no defined Service Level Objectives, not integrated with enterprise security, has no access to production data).
Other Background Information
SSA’s current production Database environment includes support for Oracle 10g and DB2 v7.2 for z/OS.  Note: SSA does not at this time plan to include Microsoft SQL Server as a 3rd Enterprise database.
SSA’s desktops are running Microsoft XP Professional SP2.  Upgrade to Microsoft Vista is in the planning stage.  
SSA uses Microsoft SMS and Hewlett Packard Radia for software distribution.  
The current desktop application suite includes Microsoft Office 2003, Internet Explorer 6, Outlook/Exchange, and IBM PCOM for mainframe connectivity.
SSA has deprecated support for fat client and client/server applications, e.g. applications which require application software components to be distributed to the desktop.
SSA does not expect that WDPE applications or COTS will be Internet facing for security reasons.
Employees With Disabilities (Section 508) Requirements

The software that is configured in SSA’s WDPE must be compatible with Federal Government Section 508 standards.  Section 508 software standards can be found at www.section508.gov.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Prospective Evaluation of Immunologic and IMMunogenetic susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and progression to disease
<DESC>Title:  Prospective Evaluation of Immunologic and Immunogenetic Susceptibility to Mycobacterium Tuberculosis infection and progression to disease


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV, Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention intends to award a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition procedures to Laboratories at Bonfils, Inc., 717 Yosemite Street, Denver, Colorado  80230-6918, the only source that has access to prior data required to perform this contract.   In 2002, CDC funded Laboratories At Bonfils to perform the HLA testing required for this project.  Developing HLA typing assays and performing HLA testing is a specialized skill.  The sensitivity and specificity of HLA assays for the same parameter vary from laboratory to laboratory.  To maintain comparability of results, it is important that all samples be tested in a single laboratory.  It is essential to the scientific quality of the results that the remainder of the HLA assays for the study also be performed in the same laboratory.   Fifteen thousand of the 1,986 samples have been tested and collected for this project.  CDC is now preparing the final 486 samples for HLA typing.  The vendor will perform HLA Class II typing for DRB1 and DQB1 for 486 DNA samples through specimen number 1986.  DNA will be extracted from whole blood samples.  DNA samples will be shipped to the vendor for HLA testing.  HLA Class II typing for DRB and DRQ alleles will be performed using Luminex DNA micro-particle bead technology.  Results will be decoded by the vendor before submission to CDC.  Results of this work serve as a critical step in the process of developing and testing new candidate vaccines for tuberculosis.  

The period of performance is 4 months from date of award.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on response to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Contractors may register by calling 1-888-227-2423 or register via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.  Registration Notification of any changes shall be made only through FedBizOpps, http://ww.fedbizopps.gov.

The purpose of this study will be to develop an assay or combination of methods to examine/evaluate potential mucosal factors that inhibit HIV-infection. This study is a follow-up to previous year studies and requires pig-tail macaques to ensure comparable data sets across studies.  CDC will enroll the Female Pig-tail Macaques in this pre-clinical, topical microbicide intervention study to evaluate soluble DC-SIGN for the prevention of mucosal SHIV transmission in a repeat challenge macaque model of HIV-infection, evaluate the immunologic kinetics at peripheral and mucosal sites,  evaluate combination topical microbicide/oral ARV intervention to block SHIV infection in a repeat-exposure macaque model of HIV-1 infection, and conduct a retrospective evaluation of immunologic kinetics in oral TDF-treated macaques that were part of a rectal transmission study. The vendor shall test and transport  to CDC 9 female pig-tail macaques in accordance with federal regulations for research animal use and care.  

The period of performance is 12 months from date of award.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.

<SUBJECT>X -- Office Trailer/SOCCENT
<DESC>This is not a request for competitive proposals.  This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source order with Resun Leasing Incorporated, 22810 Quicksilver Dr, Dulles, VA 20166-2007.  The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to award a follow-on delivery order to Resun Leasing Incorporated under the authority of FAR 6.302-2 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  We require one (1 each) 4,000 square foot temporary office space to house HQ SOCCENT/J6 administration staff while the main facility undergoes renovation.  

Description

(1 each) 58’4” long x 56’ wide office trailer unit with five sections.  The trailer will consist of at least eight (8) offices as well as a large common area and two restroom facilities, male and female.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination to Macdill AFB, FL 33621. NAICS Code is 531120, Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings (except miniwarehouses), the size standard of which is $6,500,000.00 (Not to exceed). The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16. The following FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses apply: 52.252-2, 252.204-7004 Alt 1, 252.212-7001, 252.225-7001, 252.232-7003, 252.247-7024, 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (10 AUG 2005), 5352.242-9000. For the exact text and wording of clauses and provisions please see http://farsite.hill.af.mil or http://www.arnet.gov/far/. Interested parties may respond via e-mail to joyce.wright@macdill.af.mil, NLT Monday, 9 Apr 07, 0800 EST.

	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY). 

The Redi-Plex trailers are a constructed 4000 sq.ft temporary office space for housing HQ SOCCENT/J6 administration staff while the main facility undergoes renovation.

a.	Maintaining the incumbent precludes substantial non-recoverable duplication of cost (Ref: FAR 6.302(a) (2) (iii) (A)).  Market research revealed that replacing the current contractor would mean an additional $20,000.00 to deliver and set up the five trailers. This cost has already been paid to the incumbent.  The additional $20,000.00 for delivery and set-up fees would be lost and would have to be paid to a new contractor.  It is not reasonable to expect to recover these costs through competition and it is not reasonable to pay for requirements the Government has already paid for.  
b.	Bringing another contractor on board would mean displacing thirty-five plus office staff three to five weeks during the removal and replacement of trailers.  Displacement would mean suspending operations between HQ SOCCENT/J6, coalition, and US Forces disrupting continuity, cohesion and possibly endangering ongoing operations.  
c.	Additionally, bringing another contractor on board would mean having to temporarily move office computers and equipment from the incumbent’s trailers to temporary storage while the replacement trailers are set-up.  Since there are no available facilities on base to store equipment additional costs would have to be incurred for temporary storage. Moreover, this would mean redirecting man-hours from mission to the transfer of equipment from incumbent’s trailers to temporary storage to replacement trailers possibly risking damage to the equipment and personnel.  All things considered, maintaining the incumbent saves money, time, and resources.

This one-day event will consist of presentations by key speakers within the acquisition community who will provide examples of requirements/announcements, methods on how to respond to announcements, and resources on where related information can be found. Participants will also be given the opportunity to have one-on-one discussions with NCI program staff and representatives from companies that currently hold large contracts with the NCI. This provides a real opportunity to obtain advice on Federal subcontracting opportunities.

Two representatives from your organization are invited to attend. Limited seating is available. You will be responsible for covering the cost of your travel to this event.

<SUBJECT>V -- Transportation Services
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), intends to issue a modification to the existing ICE Contract Number 
ACL-2-C-0004 to increase man-hours for the detention and transportation services in support of the Northwest Detention Facility, 1623 East J St., Tacoma, WA, by other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1(2)(ii)(B) to GEO Group, Inc. (GEO), 621 NW 53rd St., Suite 700, Boca Raton, FL 33487-8242.  The requirement involves providing and maintaining all management, supervision, manpower, training, licenses, equipment, supplies, certificates, insurance, pre-employment screening, communication capabilities and vehicles to provide transportation services for other than hospital and local transportation requirements.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Transportation Service is critical to ICE to achieve its mission.  It is in the best interest of DHS ICE to have the aforementioned services performed without threat of disruption of services.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed modification was based on market research via CCR and SBA Dynamic Small Business Search websites.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI):  Strategic Collaboration
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): Strategic Collaboration
SN07-28

DARPA seeks white papers describing innovative ideas and concepts supporting Strategic Collaboration.  Individuals and organizations with innovative ideas in the areas outlined in this RFI are invited to submit a white paper in accordance with the Instructions to Responders.

DESCRIPTION

The recent and increasing prominence of Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction (SSTR) and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations pose a qualitatively and quantitatively new type of problem for the US military.  SSTR/HADR operations are considerably more complex than traditional single-service, joint-service, or even coalition operations, in that they typically involve a large, diverse mix of military organizations, non-military government organizations, regional and international government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private volunteer organizations (PVOs), individual volunteers, and the local population.  These operations are:

1.	Large-scale:  Entire regional or national populations can be affected by natural disasters or conflicts, engaging thousands of responders and stakeholders with diverse skills, resources, fields of expertise, orientations, cultures, objectives, and languages.
2.	Dynamic, Structurally and Interactively Complex:  Involving both structured organizations and dynamic, ad hoc, and emergent teams, SSTR/HADR operations are event-driven and rapidly evolve under unforeseen and often urgent circumstances.  Responding organizations and individuals arrive on-scene, and are reinforced or depart according to their own schedules, resources, political realities, or other circumstances.
3.	Ad Hoc:  Every SSTR/HADR operation is unique.  Most of the responders and stakeholders have never worked before (a) with each other, (b) with the indigenous populations, (c) with the host governments, (d) with local military and paramilitary forces, or (e) with civilian service organizations.  Some responding organizations, particularly military and paramilitary groups, may have highly structured command and control (C2) hierarchies, while other groups may be less rigorously organized.
4.	Cross-domain:  Effective operations require those involved to cut across multiple organizations and institutions, fields of expertise, and cultures. 
5.	Many and Diverse Actors:  Typically, there are 1,000s of participants/stakeholders from 100s of organizations with diverse skills, orientations, cultures, interests, objectives, and languages.
6.	Emergent:  Solutions require spontaneity, innovation, creation and combinations of both new and old techniques.  Supporting emergence requires, among other things, a system, which provides near real time feedback of actors and their locations, capabilities, expertise, activities, and teams in non-intrusive and intuitive ways.  System transparency and feedback are essential attributes for effective self-organization.

The problems found in these situations exceed the ability of any one actor or organization to solve or even to comprehend.  No single person has the experience or expertise to detect, recognize, conceptualize, represent, and experiment with these problems in order to solve them.  SSTR/HADR operations require participants to collaborate across domains, organizations, cultures, and languages.  For the purposes of this RFI, this is called Strategic Collaboration.

INFORMATION SOUGHT

This RFI seeks information on relevant technologies and concepts that could form the basis for a DARPA program to develop a Strategic Collaboration capability, i.e., a network-enabled collaborative environment (tools, processes, embedded metrics, organizing principles, new concepts of operations, runtime analysis, etc.) within which large numbers of people (1,000s of people from 100s of organizations, with different experiences, cultures, expertise, and concepts/constructs/languages) can come together in top-directed organizations, as well as emergent communities (communities of interest), in discourse and collaboration (each with their own language using their own tools, procedures, methods, etc.) to detect, recognize, conceptualize, represent, and experiment with the extremely complex problems of large scale SSTR/HADR operations, beyond any one person?s experience or comprehension to solve alone, within the context of a single integrated environment (gaming, simulation, and instrumented C2).

Specifically, this RFI seeks information on relevant technologies, capabilities, and concepts in the following areas:

1.	Semantic Glue:  Provide individuals from diverse organizations and cultures, speaking different languages and having different goals, the ability to collaborate in support of SSTR/HADR operations.  ?Semantic Glue? refers to the collection of technologies and capabilities that will enable strategic collaboration by providing lightweight, adaptive and interactive representation schemes (language, icons, and geospatial graphics) for exchanging information, across a wide array of devices with different form factors (ranging from cell phones to desk top computers), in environments with varying network bandwidth and reliability, while providing semantically meaningful information appropriate to the individual, organization, form factor, and network capacity.
2.	Ad Hoc, Dynamic Networking on Diverse, Unstable Networks:  Considerable progress has been made in developing ad hoc networking capabilities under the assumption that the responding organization owns the networks and the devices; however, deploying complete communications network systems to support the large numbers of SSTR/HADR participants is not only prohibitive, it is impractical from the point of view of needing to train all participants to use these devices.  As recent SSTR/HADR operations have shown, the local environment often retains some level of communications connectivity (landline, cellular, satellite, etc.).  Further, individuals in disaster areas often already have devices with which they are familiar and upon which they have useful data.  Ideally, SSTR/HADR responders should leverage existing networks and devices to support Strategic Collaboration.  This requires the ability to perform ad hoc, on demand networking on public and private networks, which may be unstable and evolving.  Requirements include the ability to: detect the health and status of the network(s); manage the flow of information as a function of the transmitting and receiving devices (form factors) and available bandwidth; and allow individuals and organizations to register their existing and often non-interoperable devices and platforms.  This must be accomplished with minimal technical staff and be interpretable by typical, non-technical operators.
3.	Mobile Computing Applications to Support Local Optimization:  The traditional military approach of top-down organization/optimization of resources is not feasible in these environments; however, there are often large numbers of people and organizations who are ready, willing, and able to assist.  Recent web-based examples have demonstrated that people can dynamically network to achieve common goals such as conducting commerce via online auctions (e.g., eBay ?) and markets (e.g., Craigslist ?), developing new social networks (online dating services, social networking sites), and planning and carrying out volunteer, ad hoc activities (e.g., GeoMissions via Geocaching ?).  An analogous set of tools and capabilities could be developed to support SSTR/HADR operations, allowing both formal organizations and individuals to locally match their resources and needs.  Specifically, teams wrestling with understanding, framing, and solving problems could find the expertise, knowledge, and team mates they need.  Individuals and organizations would be able to access these tools a la a web-based, text messaging, or similar interface using their own devices (from cell phones to desk top computers), register capabilities/needs, and be ?matched? to the appropriate activities.  Participants could also provide information back to the system in the form of local reports.  Technology to support this includes Web 2.0, mobile computing, lightweight frameworks to support information exchange (see ?Semantic Glue? above), among others.
4.	Understanding (Human) Network Performance:  Provide a higher level understanding of emerging human networks, their capabilities, and capacities, in terms of commander intent and objectives, understandable by average people on the scene charged with making key resource decisions but who are not network experts.  Identify those emergent networks that are performing well and those that may need assistance or direction.  Provide visualizations to cause emergent systems to evolve in intended ways.  Provide feedback on the status of key SSTR/HADR elements (medical, food, water, security, etc.) as well as the SSTR/HADR human terrain.
5.	System Level Issues:  Combining all of these capabilities into a rapidly deployable system presents significant challenges. The resulting system needs to be able to operate in both a reachback and in a standalone mode; it needs to be robust to disruptions in connectivity and maintain system and information integrity and security; and it needs to be persistent across many operations so as to enable learning, e.g., last year?s tsunami becomes this year?s game/simulation, which becomes next year?s ?tuned? instrumented SSTR/HADR C2 system. 
6.	Mensuration:  The resulting system should be instrumented to support continuous adaptation, feedback, and optimization of resources.  Embedded real-time metrics could support machine learning for both human networks and the communication networks upon which they depend.  New concepts are needed for defining metrics and instrumentation to support SSTR/HADR operations and measure collaboration.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. RFQ No. 07SQ810144, this solicitation is issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-15. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541930 with a small business size standard of $6.5 Million.  (See Numbered Note 1). STATEMENT OF WORK: American Sign Language Interpreters (Underwater Inspections) 1.0 	GENERAL.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for sign language interpretation services to be performed at Boulder City, NV, April 23, 2007 through April 27, 2007.  The Federal employee is attending a week long training course which is required of all members of the Bureau of Reclamation Underwater Investigation Team (scuba diving team). No more than 70 hours of classroom sessions and water exercises are anticipated (see #4 Diving Training Schedule).  The Federal employee is deaf and the training instructors require sign language interpretation services to communicate with the Federal employee.  The interpreters must hold current certification through the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (as a CI, CT, CSC, or MCSC). 2.0	WORK TO BE PERFORMED BY CONTRACTOR:  Reclamation has a need for contract sign language interpreters.  The deaf Federal employee speaks fluent English and will not require ASL to English translation.  However, contractors shall provide team interpretation services for the training instructors, translating English to American Sign Language (ASL).  Scuba diving terminology will be used extensively.  The interpreters will not be required to go into the water, but shall provide interpretation services in a variety of locations whether indoors or outdoors; such as classrooms, docks, dams, motorboats, and on shore beaches.  Due to the length of the work assignment, interpretation shall be conducted by a team of two interpreters at all time. 	The locations of the classroom training will be held at U.S. Bureau of Reclamation facilities located in or near Boulder City, NV.  Scuba diving exercises are scheduled to be held nearby in the Colorado River at several locations, including Lake Mead, depending on the nature of the exercises.   The interpreters shall provide his/her own meals and his/her own means of land transportation and hotel accommodation during the training. The deaf Federal Employee is scheduled to attend all training sessions. The interpreter provider agency will be notified immediately of any changes made to the schedule.  The interpreters shall be available and present for the duration of the training.   3.0	DIVING TRAINING SCHEDULE:   There will be a period of time for lunch and dinner each day, during which sometimes debriefing or classroom session is occurring.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA
The items being offered must be mature commercial off the shelf items with proven field usage.  The source selection will be based on proposals that provide the best value to the Government.  Technical acceptability will be rated on a PASS/FAIL basis.  To be technically acceptable, the offeror must receive a rating of pass in each of the minimum capability categories described above (see 1 – 14).  If the product is not technically acceptable, no further proposal evaluation will be conducted.

EVALUATION FACTORS

I.	Past Performance
a.	Quality
b.	Timeliness
c.	Business Professionalism
d.	Customer Satisfaction

II.  Experience
III. Price	
Factors to be evaluated are Past Performance, Experience and Price.  These elements are listed in descending order of importance.  Past Performance and Experience combined are more important than price.  Subfactors under the factor of Past Performance are:  Quality, Timeliness, Business Professionalism, and Customer Satisfaction.  The subfactors are equal in importance.  There are no subfactors under Experience and Price.  
Technical Proposals must include Descriptive Literature to include copies of Warranty and Operations and Maintenance Manuals for products being proposed, and product samples at no cost to the Government.   Contractor is responsible for shipping costs to and from Lakehurst.   Product Samples must be received at Lakehurst no later than 24 April 2007.  Products will be evaluated and compared to the minimum range of capabilities (See No. 1 – No. 14 above) to determine technical acceptability.   Matting samples will be returned in “as is” condition at the contractor’s request and expense.
For the factor of Experience, each proposal will be assigned a risk assessment rating.  The Risk Assessment ratings are:  Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk and Unknown Risk.  Each offeror must identify actual design and assembly of Extreme Light Weight Matting to enable the Government to verify the offeror’s experience.  In making the determination of experience level, consideration will be given as to whether an offeror has experience in manufacturing matting of similar type and size.
For Past Performance, offerors must provide evidence of proven field usage, and names and phone numbers of recent customers, and prices to previous customers for mat that is identical or similar to those being proposed herein.   Offerors will complete Attachment 1 for three (3) contracts relevant to this procurement.  The Government will conduct a performance risk evaluation based upon the past performance of the offeror as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements.  The Risk Assessment ratings are:  Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk and Unknown Risk.   Unknown risk is a neutral rating, and will apply to offerors with no past performance in this commodity.  The Government may also consider past performance information that is available from sources other than those identified by the offeror.  
For Price, offerors are requested to separately price their matting and accessories by completing Section B.  Each required accessory (i.e. jack kits, stakes, etc.) should be priced separately.  In addition, offerors must include a commercial price list of their products and accessories with part numbers.  Each offeror’s price proposal will be evaluated using a quantity of  500 units for each of the five years for matting, and a quantity of 10 units for each of the five years for the accessories.   This quantity represents the most likely quantity to be ordered per year.    

GREATEST VALUE EVALUATION
The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror, conforming to the solicitation determined to represent the best value to the Government cost/price and other factors considered.  The offeror’s proposal shall be in the form prescribed by this solicitation and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified, which affect the evaluation factors for award.
Evaluation of an offeror’s proposal will be based on the information presented in the written proposal along with input obtained from outside sources relevant to past performance.  Proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical or schedule commitments may be deemed to be reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence, or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed factors or subfactors, may be used as a basis for eliminating a proposal from further consideration.  
The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror’s methods and approach in meeting the requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence to ensure successful performance.  Each Factor will be evaluated and assigned a risk assessment rating.
The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms.  However, if considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted with only those offeror’s determined to have a reasonable chance for award.  The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.

Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.

Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.

Registered in the CCR database means that--

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “DUNS” or “DUNS +4” followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--

(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or

(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:

(i) Company legal business.

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.

(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.

(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).

(v) Company Telephone Number.

(vi) Date the company was started.

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to answer business and technical questions received against this RFP.  

Question 1:  Section 4d of the specifications sets forth a transceiver data rate requirement of 360 kbits/sec with a goal of 540 kbits/sec.  The functional objective for data downlink, as described in Section 4, is to support real-time transmission and display of continuous RGB waterfall imagery at the full frame rate.  If the functional requirement for a real-time waterfall image display at the ground station can be met with a transceiver that operates at a data rate below 360 kbits/sec, would such a solution be acceptable?

Answer 1:  Proposal preparation and content is the responsibility of the Offeror.  All proposals received will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria and procedures cite in the synopsis/solicitation to determine the Best Value to the Government.

Question 2:  We would like to propose a system based on a novel optical design that does not utilize a standard objective lens, and consequently the 'Lens Interface' requirement listed in Table 2 is not appropriate.  Will you consider a proposal for a system in which the IFOV is not adjustable by switching objective lenses?

Answer 2:  See Answer 1, above.  The Government encourages submission of innovative designs.

Question 3:  Section 4a specifies a spectral resolution goal of 5 +/- 1nm; however, Table 2 specified 5 +/- 2nm.  Which is the desired spectral reolution tolerance?

Answer 3:  +/- 1nm

Question 4:  Can the maximum power limits in Table 1 be exceeded for individual units so long as the total power requirement for the system does not exceed the total package limit?

Answer 4: No. 

Question 5:  Section 4 states that the base station shall 'receive the telemetry and data broadcast by the UAV system.'  What is meant by the term 'telemetry'?

Answer 5: For the purpose of this solicitation, telemetry means ancillary data, such as position, temperature, power consumption, etc.

Q6:  What contract type does the Government anticipate using for an award, if made?

A6:  Firm-Fixed Price-Commercial Supply.


Q7:  Is the delivery timeline a mandatory requirement as stated, or can an alternative schedule be proposed.

A7:  Proposal preparation and content is the responsibility of the offeror. The delivery timeline in the synopsis/solicitation is hereby revised to read: 'Delivery shall be no later than 365 days from date of award.  The Government would prefer delivery within 180 days from the date of award.'

<DESC>AMENDMENT #5:  The purpose of Amendment No. 5 is to CANCEL this solicitation in its entirety due to a major change in the scope of thr contract requirements.  Due to recent changes and developments in mission requirements, the 46 Test Wing no longer has a requirement for a 4-foot antenna system.  The original solicitation called for purchase of a 4-foot and a 6-foot antenna system followed by refurbishment of nine other antenna systems currently in place at various sites around Eglin AFB, FL.  The 96 Contracting Squadron will be issuing a new solicitation request for proposals (RFP) listing new requirements for an as of yet undetermined number of 6-foot antenna systems (TBD).  Another separate solicitation will later follow for the refurbishment portion of the nine antennas (also TBD).  Again, this solicitation is cancelled in its entirety -  thank you for your interest and your company’s time that has been invested in this requirement.  Any questions concerning this cancellation can be directed to Mr. Greg Parry, Contracting Officer at 850-882-8113 (gregory.parry@eglin.af.mil) or Mike DeNamur, Contract Specialist at 850-882-0339 (email michael.denamur@eglin.af.mil).
