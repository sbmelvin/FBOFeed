<a href="mailto:colleen.mclaughlin-heasty@faa.gov">colleen.mclaughlin-heasty@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Introduction:  This public announcement is being issued in accordance with Acquisition Management System (AMS) 3.2.1.2, for the purpose of conducting market research to determine interest and capabilities for support in all aspects of Verification & Validation (V&V) for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) as well as legacy systems to be performed for the FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center located in Atlantic City International Airport, NJ.  Responses to this market survey are for informational purposes only. This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request For Proposal (RFP). The FAA is neither seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing a response to this market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with a market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
Purpose:  The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from both large and small businesses (all categories) to determine capability to provide V&V services in accordance with the attached draft statement of work (SOW).  Information obtained will be used to refine the competitive strategy on a possible future solicitation. The nature of competition has not been determined, and the FAA may decide to do a full and open competition, a full or partial set-aside for various small business categories, such as among small businesses, eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program, etc.  The FAA may consider a multiple award procurement vehicle with various competitive categories, etc., or to pursue other methods to obtain needed services.  Time and materials type arrangement(s) are anticipated for 10 years.  Selected contract vehicles may also allow performance on a firm fixed price or cost type basis. The maximum number of awardees is undetermined at this time.
A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that they are excluded from any resultant competition.  However, the failure of adequate small business participation in this market survey may result in the government determining there is not sufficient qualified small business' interested to set aside this procurement or portions thereof for small business.  Therefore, full and open competition would be considered.
Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this market survey to ensure their corporate capabilities are considered in determining the appropriateness of a set-aside(s).
All interested firms are invited to submit a Capability Statement, a Business Declaration Form, a V&V Supplemental Capabilities Worksheet, as well as any Small Business Administration (SBA) certification letter(s). 
Information on pricing is NOT required at this time. 
Incumbent Information:  There is no incumbent(s) for this procurement.
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code:   The NAICS code anticipated for this requirement is 541330, Exception a., (Engineering Services-Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons) with the applicable size standard of $27M. 
Submission Requirements and Instructions:  The attached draft SOW is provided for review.  Three documents are to be executed and submitted: a) Capability Statement, b) Business Declaration Form, and c) V&V Supplemental Capabilities Worksheet.  
a) Capability Statement -  This document must be completed in Times New Roman with 12 point font, single spaced, on 8.5 X 11 inch paper setting with one-inch margins using Microsoft Word 2003.  This submission should follow the suggested template but must be limited to no more than eight (8) pages (any excess will be discarded) and describe examples of your company's actual work experience in the following areas: 
1.	Performance on a prime contract or subcontract supporting V&V activities in aviation or aerospace program efforts within the last five (5) years. Please include the period of performance, contract dollar amount, brief description of the contract, the agency or organization from whom the contract was awarded, contract number, and a Contracting Officer/Contracting Officer's Representative point of contact with telephone number.2.	Corporate experience and capabilities providing V&V support. Respondents must review Section 3.0 - Requirements of the draft statement of work and detail which sections they may be capable of performing citing examples if applicable.  3.	Experience in teaming or subcontracting to obtain and retain qualified personnel capable of providing V&V support. Draft your response in conjunction with the V&V Supplemental Capabilities Worksheet cited below.   4.	Understanding and familiarity with the FAA's Test & Evaluation Quality Management System, or similar systems in compliance with ISO Certification Standard 9001:2008. 
b) Business Declaration Form - This form is required by the FAA. 
c) V&V Supplemental Capabilities Worksheet - This document seeks information on your company's current staff and other information. Do not include teaming or subcontracting arrangements, only in-house capabilities and personnel. The labor categories listed reflect possible labor positions that may be requested on a proposed V&V solicitation but are not a prequalification worksheet. Additional labor definitions other than those contained in the draft statement of work will not be provided. 
Delivery of Submission:  Responses are due by 3:00 PM, EST (Eastern Standard Time), November 21, 2011 and must be sent electronically to email 9-ACT-VNVWJHTC@faa.gov.  The FAA welcomes any general comments regarding the content of the draft SOW. Questions or comments must be submitted in writing prior to the closing date and directed to email 9-ACT-VNVWJHTC@faa.gov. No telephonic inquires will be accepted.  
Non-Government Personnel Participation:  The FAA will utilize contractor support personnel (B3 Solutions) in this acquisition.  B3 Solutions employees will not be members of Technical Evaluation Teams, but may assist in meeting with customer organizations and review submissions.  B3 Solutions employees will sign all relevant Non-Disclosure of Information and Conflict of Interest Agreements for this acquisition.  The exclusive responsibility for source selection remains with the FAA. 
Other:  It is highly recommended that interested vendors check the FAA's Contract Opportunities website frequently for any updates and amendments to this announcement.  Also, if this announcement is being viewed from other than the FAA's Contract Opportunities website, some information and/or attachments may not transfer correctly.  Therefore, only the information/attachments provided at http://faaco.faa.gov under current announcements for the AJA-Technical Center (Atlantic City, NJ) region is considered the "official" source of information on this requirement. 
If after as a result of this market survey a solicitation is issued, it will be publicly announced on the FAA's Contract Opportunities website.  It is the potential vendor's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research and obtain rough order of magnitude (ROM) pricing and technical information regarding potential solutions for implementing a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) telecom expense management (TEM) product. The IRS is primarily interested in a vendor-hosted business process outsourcing (BPO) model.

The IRS is seeking information on a BPO TEM solution that will enable its telecom users to centrally manage telecom assets and expenses. The BPO model envisions associated hardware and software hosted by the vendor in a dedicated (not shared) environment with the TEM solution delivering its functionality to end users through an industry standard browser without the need to download and/or install any client applications on the users’ desktops. 

The IRS is requesting information on TEM solutions (products and/or services) that would provide telecommunications management capabilities such as: Contracts Management, Ordering and Provisioning, Inventory Management, Invoice and Dispute, Usage Management, and Reporting and Business Intelligence.

The scope of the telecommunications services that the IRS is interested in managing include the following services that combine for an approximate $100M annual expenditure: Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) services, IRS-owned premise VoIP systems, Long Distance (LD) services, Calling Cards (CC) and Audio Conferencing Services (ACS), Video Teleconferencing Services (VTS), Federal Relay Service (FRS) and Video Relay Services (VRS), Wireless – Cell Phone service, Toll-Free Contact Center (TFCC) service, Electronic Fax (eFax) services, Voice Mail Service (VMS), and Enterprise Network service (specifically the Treasury Network - TNET)

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ proposes a limited source order under Federal Supply Schedule 66, Contract GS-07F-9173S, with TCOM, L.P., 7115 Thomas Edison Drive, Columbia, MD, 21046, for the procurement of up to eleven (11) 28M+ Aerostat Systems, and the associated spares for the Naval Air Systems Command 4.5x Special Surveillance Programs (SSP). This action is authorized by the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies (FAR 8.401), and as prescribed in FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) - Limited Sources Justification and Approval.
<p>The 28M+ Aerostats and site spares are being procured for use at the Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS) Forward Operating Bases. The technology being fielded as part of the PGSS is specifically tailored to protect US and Coalition forces by providing surveillance and locating and detecting hostile forces that are approaching in the distance, giving US Forces ample time for situation awareness and an effective response. This procurement will enhance PGSS site with superior capability that can immediately enhance operational capability and unit situational awareness while significantly reducing the systems susceptibility to weather and hostile action. <br /><br />The use of TCOM provides integrated logistic support and interoperability within the already existing PGSS system. TCOM is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer, and distributer of the TCOM 28M+ Aerostat system already being utilized by the PGSS system. The TCOM 28M+ aerostats, tether-up spares, and system spares have been integrated and are a critical component of the standardized PGSS. The Government does not possess the technical data on the proprietary TCOM aerostat, mooring station and tether technology to permit full and open competition. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing that may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses should reference solicitation number N68335-12-R-0010. Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice. The Point of Contact is Patrick Smith, Phone: (732) 323-7754, E-mail: patrick.w.smith2@navy.mil.</p>

<a href="mailto:katie.adkins.civ@swrmc.navy.mil">SOUTHWEST REGIONAL MAINTENANCE CENTER</a>
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command through full and open competition awarded contract N00024-08-C-2300 for the accomplishment of Post Shakedown Availabilities (PSA) and drydocking for DDG 102(USS SAMPSON) and with options for the accomplishment of six additional DDG 51 Class PSAs.  The Government awarded this single contract to BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair, 2205 East Belt, San Diego, CA 92113, with a five-year performance period after considering all bids submitted by responsible sources. The PSA encompasses all the manpower, support services, material, non-standard equipment and associated technical data and documents required to prepare for and accomplish the PSA.  The work to be accomplished will include correction of Government responsible trial card deficiencies, new work identified between ship custody transfer and the start of PSA and incorporation of approved engineering changes that were not incorporated during the construction period which are not otherwise the building yardâ€™s responsibility under the ship construction contract.
 This will also include drydocking the ship, engineering and management support for the PSAs, providing effort and material to perform specified work items inclusive of tests and post repair sea trials to complete performance of PSAs, emergent and other work.  Work on all vessels will take place in the ship's homeport area of San Diego, CA.  

To date the DDG 102(USS SAMPSON) and the four option ships DDG 104(STERETT), DDG 105(DEWEY), DDG 106(STOCKDALE), and DDG 108(WAYNE E. WILLIAMS) PSAs have been executed under contract N00024-08-C-2300.  The final two option ships DDG 110(WILLIAM P LAWRENCE) and DDG 111(SPRUANCE) have been awarded under contract N00024-08-C-2300.  The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue a modification to contract N00024-08-2300, on a sole-source basis to BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair, 2205 East Belt, San Diego, CA 92113, to accomplish a total of approximately $8M in new work above the original contract amount for the final two option ships.
  $4.5M of the $8M will be for accomplishing new work above originally specified amount in the level of effort CLIN.  $3.5M of the $8M total will be for accomplishing industrial support effort for SHIPALTs that will be funded and pulled ahead for installation during both PSAs by SPAWAR, NSWC Crane, and NSWC Dahlgren.  As the PSA execution shipyard for the DDG 110(WILLIAM P LAWRENCE) and DDG 111(SPRUANCE) PSAs, BAE Systems is the only firm capable of providing timely and effective manpower, support services, material, non-standard equipment and associated technical data and documents required to prepare for and accomplish during each of the two PSAâ€™s period of performance.  BAE Systems has the requisite familiarity and knowledge of DDG 51 configurations as well as a detailed understanding of the execution of DDG 51 class PSAs.
  The resultant contract mod will be for same period of performance as for each of the final two PSAs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking proposals from General Contractors to provide the Office of Construction and Facilities Management, design build construction services for substantial modifications to the boiler and control systems at the Miami VA Healthcare System Central Plant . During the time of installation in 2005, VA standards and specifications were not followed. This led to difficulties and safety hazards during current operation and maintenance procedures. The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment, supervision, and design-build services necessary for design and construction for the upgrade and correction of deficiencies of the boiler and control systems;  boiler induced draft fan installation;  boiler/plant control system upgrade;  miscellaneous boiler plant corrections;  control points as required by plans and specifications issued with this solicitation.  Work shall include demolition, installation, site clean-up other specific tasks as further defined by this request for proposal (RFP).
This procurement is set aside 100% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). The firm must be a General Construction Firm with an approved NAICS Code 236220, Small Business Size Standard of $33.5 million.  The estimated cost for this project is between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000. This project (546PM2088) is for the Miami VA Healthcare System Central Plant , Miami, FL. 
All work shall be accomplished in accordance with VA standards and specifications outlined in the VA Technical Information Library (TIL) located at www.cfm.va.gov/til/. 

All work shall be accomplished within 215 calendar days of receipt of Notice to Proceed.  

Boiler Induced Draft Fan Installation 
The current boiler exhaust system is undersized to operate the two (2) existing 400 HP boilers at full capacity. There is also a single point of failure identified to be an induced draft fan. The submission documents identify an upsize in stack diameter from 24" to 32" as well as the placement of two (2) new variable speed induced draft fans placed on the roof of the old boiler plant. The fan speed will modulate to maintain a constant boiler breeching pressure. The power from these fans will come from an electrical panel located on the mezzanine of the old boiler plant. A structural analysis of the old boiler plant roof was performed and was determined that additional framing/support is not required. 

Boiler/Plant Control System Upgrade 
The current control system, instruments, monitoring and data management systems and accessories for the boilers, burners and other boiler plant mechanical equipment is subpar. The submission documents identify the replacement of the boiler/burner combustion control systems, burner management systems (flame safeguard), and data management and instrumentation systems. This also includes parallel positioning with O2 trim control, boiler efficiency monitoring, boiler master, plant master, single element feed water, condensate/deaerator tank control and monitoring as well as induced draft fan control. New combustion control panels, new burner management panels and a new plant master panel will be provided. The combustion control and plant master system will be based on programmable automation controller technology with local touch screens. The existing deaerator tank (with three pumps) and condensate tank (with two pumps) will be provided with a new control and monitoring system. See the "Control Points" section for a list of systems, points, and devices expected to see installed.
 
Miscellaneous Boiler Plant Corrections 
Many piping/testing items are identified in the submission documents.

<a href="mailto:michael.velez5@us.army.mil">ACC-APG SCRT - Edgewood</a>
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice ONLY.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not receive a response.  The Joint Project Manager, Protection (JPM P) is issuing this sources sought announcement as part of a market survey to establish a baseline of knowledge within industry relative to the technical maturity and availability of Chemical and Biological (CB) protective respirators for use in a broad range of fixed wing military aircraft that will provide combined protection for CB and gravity induced loss of consciousness (GLOC).  The JPM P wishes to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the developmental requirements of the Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) Fixed Wing (FW).<br><br>Background:  The Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) is defined as a system for individual aircrew head/eye respiratory and percutaneous protection against CB warfare agents, radiological particles, continuous protection against CB agent permeation, and protection against selected toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) and toxic industrial materials (TIMs) for sustained operations in the presence of these threats.  When integrated with aircraft-mounted and crew-mounted breathing equipment (in aircraft so equipped), the system will provide combined (simultaneous as required) hypoxia, CB, and anti-G protection. JSAM is a modular system, which has several variants to satisfy the requirements for different applications (e.g., fighter/attack, other fixed wing, non-helmeted).  The JSAM-FW will be a lightweight, protective mask system (consisting of a mask, integrated CB protective hood with neckdam, filters, blower and accessories) incorporating state of the art technology to protect aviation forces from anticipated threats. <br><br>The JSAM-FW will replace the MBU-13/P and MBU-19/P (United States Air Force [USAF]), A/P-22P-14 (V) (United States Navy [USN]/United States Marine Corps [USMC]) and M45 (United States Army [USA]) aircrew CB masks currently in the DoD inventory. The JSAM-FW will be compatible with below the neck CB ensembles (Joint Protective Aircrew Ensemble [JPACE] and the CWU-66/P Chemical Protective Coverall), be flame resistant, provide greater mobility, increase field of view, increase flexibility and reduce physiological burden compared to existing CB protective masks.<br><br>The JSAM-FW system provides head, eye, respiratory, and percutaneous protection with the following Key Performance Parameters:<br>[1]	The system shall prevent chemical agent permeation (liquid, aerosol and vapor) for a period of 16 hours {Objective 24 hours}. <br><br>[2]	Materials which contribute to eye and respiratory protection shall protect for a period of 16 hours {Objective 24 hours} to miosis levels. <br><br>[3]	The system shall achieve a Quantitative Fit Factor (QFF) of 20,000 {The objective is to provide a QFF of 120,000}.  <br><br>[4]	The system shall provide a Quantitative Fit Factor (QFF) of 100,000 {T} for the specified population against biological agents {Objective of 120,000}.<br><br>[5]	The system shall reduce respiratory exposure against the high threat Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs)/Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) using the established parameters of the C2A1 filter.  <br><br>[6]	The JSAM will provide an effective mask seal up to 60 mm Hg pressure breathing at G loads up to +9Gz for 15 seconds with a +6Gz per second onset rate when integrated with a pressure breathing for G (PBG) system such as COMBAT EDGE.  <br><br>[7]	The system must be able to survive an ejection with windblast up to 600 KEAS while maintaining CB protection.<br><br>[8]	The critical viewing area (optical surface) shall have no distortion which would impact safety of flight or prevent normal and emergency operations. <br><br>[9]	The system shall require no aircraft modifications and shall integrate with existing aircrew flight equipment, helmet mounted displays and standard aircraft oxygen connections.<br><br><br>Vendors that can provide an existing  product or a modified product that meets or exceeds the above Key Performance Parameters are invited to submit the following information in a capability statement: 1) product summary, 2) complete description of technical characteristics and capabilities, and 3) photographs, diagrams drawings and descriptions of proposed technologies.  Vendors shall also indicate if commercially developed/non-developmental items or components may be used or proposed.  Vendors are requested to submit their Capability Statement to the point of contact noted below.  <br><br>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government for follow-on-acquisition.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice, or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement or payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this Notice and Government use of such information.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Program Manager, Special Operations Forces Survival Support and Equipment Systems (PM-SOF SSES) at the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), is conducting a market investigation to identify commercially available Inflatable Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs) and/or Flotation Aids.  <br><br>The PFD is intended for use by members of the US Naval Special Warfare Command SEAL community.  It is intended to be worn during any waterborne operation - including maritime airborne operations - and cannot interfere with the SEAL's ability to operate and function with current body-worn or carried equipment. <br><br>A flotation system should be a low profile system with various activation modes including, but not limited to: (1) automatic by water pressure (i.e. depth), (2) automatic by water contact, and (3) manual (full and/or partial inflation).  The container (if applicable) and bladder should be a subdued color. <br><br>The operators desire a system that does not require a separate/stand-alone container (i.e. integrated into current equipment/vests).  However, there are scenarios where the system may have to be worn separately, so we are interested in systems with separate containers (i.e. canisters, horse-collars, etc.) that may attach to a belt or load carriage vest.   <br><br>Interested sources must, within thirty (30) days of the publication of this synopsis, respond with information on their product/technology.  At minimum, information shall include: <br><br>1)	Identification of your company/organization, location, point of contact and notification of business size and/or special status.<br><br>2)	Product Description of proposed system<br><br>3)	Relevant technical information / specifications / qualifications (i.e. technical literature, data, test reports, illustrations, photographs, videos, patents, etc.)<br><br>4)	Cost information<br><br>5)	Estimated days to deliver a system after receipt of order.     <br><br>6)	Sample system, (optional)  <br><br>If a firm chooses to submit samples they must pre-coordinate the shipment with the POC below. No payment will be made by the Government for such samples, and the samples will be returned at each company's request and each company desiring to submit or have a sample returned shall arrange for shipment at no cost to the Government. <br><br>Any information submitted will be controlled and not be returned. When a respondent must include proprietary data in order to fully communicate their product/technology, the respondent must clearly mark and identify any proprietary data that the respondent intends to be used only by the Government for evaluation purposes. <br><br>Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mr. Jonathan Rich, PM-SOF SSES, ATTN: RDNS-WPS, Bldg 4, Rm D018, Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760-5019. Submitted information must be provided in both email and hard-copy (include electronic CD or DVD format). This notice is for market research only. Questions regarding this announcement shall be directed to Jonathan Rich at 508-233-5279 or emailed to jonathan.rich@us.army.mil. The information received under this announcement may be used to purchase items for Government testing and/or prepare a solicitation package. <br>       <br>

<DESC>Synopsis:</br></br>360 Situational Awareness System for Remote Weapon Station</br></br>Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) Announcement </br></br>This Sources Sought Notice is a Request for Information (RFI) ONLY and should not be construed as a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a commitment by the U.S. Government. The US Army Contracting Command  NJ, in support of the Project Manager Crew Served Weapons, is interested in acquiring information from organizations that possess a commercially off the shelf (COTS) 360o Situational Awareness system that can integrate with the XM153 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS).  Specifically, the US Army is interested in a mature capability that will give the soldier a greater situational awareness when operating the CROWS system.  The desire is to obtain a constant view of the surroundings from within the vehicle to aid in target acquisition, detection, and identification. </br></br> Ideally, the 360o Situational Awareness system (360 SA) should affix onto the various Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles and be capable of piping the video feed onto the CROWS gunner display.  The camera system should be capable of both day and night modes, and be able to toggle between them.  The 360 o SA shall be an add-on kit that is ruggedized, and can be installed at a depot level using non-specialty tooling.  Anything that increases the ability to detect targets (i.e. pan, zoom, expand views, image stabilization, low latency) or interact with the CROWS (slew-to-cue, configurable UI layout) is considered advantageous to the system as a whole. </br></br>  There exists a need to increase the gunners situational awareness of their surroundings while operating the CROWS remote weapon station.  Currently, to inspect an area, the gunner uses the weapon station to survey a given point in space.  This not only forces the gunner to point the weapon at this location, but also reveals the direction the gunner is observing to persons outside of the vehicle. </br></br>If your company or organization has an existing commercially available or non-developmental item that meets these requirements, please provide literature or other information relative to the performance, maintenance, and physical characteristics (i.e. size, weight, etc.) of the product to the Contract Specialist listed. </br>Vendor Questionnaire: The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information from industry to assist in market research.  Firms/companies are invited to indicate their interest and capability to satisfy the above requirements by identifying the following items:</br></br>1. Company Name</br></br>2. Company Address / Country Represented / Website</br></br>3. Company point of contact and phone number</br></br>4. Business Size (Small/Large & Number of Employees)</br></br>5. NAICS Code / CAGE Code / DUNS Number</br></br>6. Commerciality</br></br>a.	( ) Our product as described above, has been sold, leased or licensed to the general public.</br></br>b.	( ) Our product as described above, has been sold in substantial quantities, on a competitive basis to multiple state and local governments.</br></br>c.	( ) None of the above applies. Explain.</br></br>7. Please provide any additional comments</br></br>Responders are advised that the US Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in the response to this RFI: all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or other solicitation, if any is issued. </br></br>This is a market survey, not a pre-solicitation notice.  There is no formal solicitation available at this time.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  All product information and hardware samples shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the government.</br></br>The government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.Information Format: It is preferred that information papers be Government Purpose Rights. Classified material will not be accepted. Material Samples can be sent, but any samples provided will be provided at no cost to the US Army.

<DESC>Interested parties must demonstrate the ability to meet all of the following requirements.

1. VISN 3 is comprised of multiple physical sites, comprising 5 organizational entities.  Each entity has its own RIS (VistA).  VISN 3 seeks to implement a VISN-wide PACS with a single database, such that any image obtained at ANY VISN 3 site is easily accessible from any OTHER VISN 3 site and such that a list of prior imaging exams for any given patient includes imaging exams performed at ALL VISN 3 facilities.  VISN 3 may wish to Regionalize/Federate interpretation of imaging studies across different VISNâ€™s or non Philips iSite Radiology PACS vendors and therefore needs a PACS that makes this not only possible, but easy to accomplish with minimal advance notice or complexity to the End User Radiologist or the IT staff to pre-configure.

2. The proposed PACS shall interface with the VA VistA (via HL7 and/or DICOM) so as to be able to ensure we receive patient and exam information, either directly or through imaging equipment as an intermediary.  The PACS shall then be capable of communicating imaging reports back to the VA VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine package, either directly or via an integrated Radiology Voice Recognition System.

2.1	 All interface engines ie. HL7, Brokers etc.  shall be contractually bound to be supported either with existing or comparable equivalent.

2.2  The vendor shall in future application software and enhancement releases be supportive of the IHE Technical Framework with respect to Integration Profiles and Actors where appropriate to provide the capability of a single User portal interface and Authentication in viewing imaging studies from other Medical Specialties.  i.e.  Nuclear Medicine, Cardiology, Import Reconciliation Workflow IHE with appropriate Actors.

3. The proposed PACS shall be capable of a high degree of integration with a Radiology Voice Recognition System, such as PowerScribe, Commissure or comparable third party vendor.  Integration implies running on the PACS diagnostic workstation and the PACS application passing user authentication and exam information to the voice recognition system, so that users who are already logged into the PACS application and who have selected a specific exam do NOT have to log into the voice recognition application or manually select the exam in the voice recognition application.

4. Since the one PACS will communicate with multiple instances of Vista, the proposed PACS will need to uniquely identify each imaging study, regardless of the site of origin.  It shall do this in such a way as to guarantee that the reports are ultimately sent back to the correct Vista system and that any additional site identifiers which might be appended to the accession number are stripped off before the information is sent back to the appropriate Vista system.

5. If the study information is passed from the PACS to the voice recognition system, the PACS shall be able to uniquely identify each study to the voice recognition system.

6. All imaging studies shall be available via â€œad hoc queryâ€ or Radiologist reading list in less than 3 seconds from any Clinical Workstation or Diagnostic Workstation (regardless of age) on site or via remote VA VPN with 100Mbps LAN speed or lower.

7. Every user (Diagnostic, Clinical, and Web) shall be presented with a RIS-driven chronological timeline of the patientâ€™s complete Radiology history.  Images shall be available with a single click and reports shall be easily available, such as with a â€œright clickâ€.

8. Images from the PACS shall be viewable throughout the enterprise via a web-based viewer.  This viewer shall be interfaced with Vista/CPRS, such that a user who has already selected a given study on a selected patient in CPRS may launch the web-based PACS viewer and view the correct image(s) without the need for additional user authentication or manual selection of the patient or exam. 

8.1	As mentioned in 2.1 above, Vendor shall have the capability of providing now or in future releases to be able to provide a single Portal User Interface and Authentication in viewing imaging studies from other Medical Specialties not necessarily archived in the PACS system.  i.e.  Cardiology, P.V. Vascular, Urology, etc..


9. Any study that is â€œad-hocâ€ queried using the web access from a standard PC shall be displayed in full fidelity full resolution (in under 3 seconds) with following PC specs: 128MB of RAM, Windows 98 or higher, 350 MHz processor.  This performance shall be contractually guaranteed with 1,000 concurrent users.

10. Vendor shall provide for End Users both on site in house and remotely via VA VPN:
a)	Unlimited # of web access licenses at full fidelity, full resolution (no lossy compression).
b)	Unlimited # of Diagnostic workstation licenses.
c)	Unlimited # of Clinical workstation licenses.
d)	Unlimited # of DICOM associations with scanners.
e)	Unlimited # of PACS integraded workstation licenses for Advanced visualization 3D software.


11. Vendor shall guarantee 99.99% up-time on the system, with financial penalties for non-compliance.  System up-time shall be defined as availability of exam images to the End-User.

12. Vendor shall include maintenance and upgrades of all included hardware and software.
13. Vendor shall supply, at no additional cost, a Vendor Neutral Archive and Storage solution or format with any additional server(s) and storage capacity required to meet the needs of VISN 3, for the term of the contract.

14. Vendor shall provide 24/7 continuous remote monitoring of the PACS hardware and software, though a VA-approved VPN connection.

15. Vendor shall agree to locate all equipment on VA premises, or other locations as determined by VISN 3.

16. Vendor shall comply with all applicable VA security and privacy regulations, as well as applicable non-VA laws and regulations, such as HIPAA.

17. Vendor shall provide, at no additional cost, a complete Disaster Recovery solution, to include:
â€¢	Real-time backup of image files.
â€¢	Continuous log files are updated.
â€¢	Twice daily incremental backup of DB.
â€¢	Weekly full back up DB.
â€¢	T1 lines needed for disaster recovery.
â€¢	Complete disaster recovery within 72 hours of a disaster (fire, flood, etc. that wipes out the server room), with penalties for non-compliance.

18. All images shall be stored on line, all the time, in RAID 5.  The system shall not use near-line or off-line storage.

19. Worklist Failover 
â€¢	A. The PACS shall have multiple databases that can fail over.
â€¢	B. Vendor shall use an active/active Clustered SQL database running Windows 2000 or Windows XP Professional.
â€¢	C. If the cluster fails, there shall be 3 other servers that can be failed over to provide access to images.

20.  Vendor shall supply 24/7 live technical support by telephone.

21.  Data Privacy and Confidentiality:

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br><br>Title:  Games for Training (GFT) Flagship Recompete<br><br>Contract Vehicle:  Full and Open<br><br>Closing Date:  31 October 2011<br><br>Brief Summary:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is conducting market research to determine interested sources and technology capabilities of contractors (both large and small) for the procurement of a new Flagship First Person Shooter (FPS).  The new FPS based game and tools should include, but is not limited, to the components and capabilities of the current FPS game, Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS2), as described in this Sources Sought Program Description.<br><br>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  PEO STRI, through requirements provided by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capabilities Manager, has a need for an FPS game to train individual Soldiers and small units in a shared semi-immersive environment.  This notice is provided to inform industry partners and solicit industry capabilities to fulfill the requirements and level of interest for the current GFT Flagship game-based simulation.  Part of the Army strategy for execution of the GFT program is to take advantage of new gaming technologies available in the commercial market whenever possible given the appropriate level of resources.  The Flagship recompete will manifest that strategy by acquiring improved technologies similar to user friendly software development, higher fidelity graphics, an ability to move across PC-platforms, web-based and mobile, and an improved interoperability capability to integrate seamlessly into the Live-Virtual-Constructive environment.<br>    <br>GFT game-based technologies provide semi-immersive, experiential learning opportunities to familiarize and train Soldiers in various tactical scenarios and environments.  This technology can be used to develop, train, and evaluate the decision making processes for the individual leaders as well as enhance teamwork at all levels.  The successful product will provide preplanned scenarios resembling the ones currently a part of the flagship baseline  along with the capability for the User to rapidly generate custom scenarios (both in preparation for a training event and in real time in the game) that provide training and education in subjects such as stability operations, cultural awareness, language, combat lifesaver skills, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) recognition and defeat, and various other skills required for current and future military operations - a flexible Full Spectrum Operations capability.<br> <br>The current GFT flagship product, VBS2, was procured in a competitive source selection in Dec 08.  Over the last three years, the product has evolved to include capabilities such as terrain paging, improved graphic realism, IED training modules, insurgent methodology training scenarios, Special Operations Command (SOCOM) enhancements, an improved cultural and language training capability, and a terrain database plug-in that will facilitate incorporation of Synthetic Environment (SE) Core databases.  The Government has also invested in several middleware capabilities that provide additional features such as enhanced indirect fire skills training and combat lifesaver and medic training.  The required product will provide the User the ability to connect existing and future middleware via an Application Programming Interface (API) or plug-in.  This will enable the addition of new training capabilities for seamless training using the Flagship game as the user interface.  This will ensure the reuse of a multitude of Governmental and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) products and features already developed.   <br>Potential future capabilities that may be included in the Flagship acquisition, or as separate efforts, are as follows:<br>     1.  Construction and Management Simulation (CMS) <br>     This requirement is for a CMS game to support full spectrum operations that includes lethal and non-lethal tasks and missions.  The gaming solution must portray the political, military, economic, social, informational, and infrastructural(PMESII) conditions and associated 2d and higher order effects of decision-making relative to those conditions.  This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br>     2.  Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Games (MMOG)<br>     Future procurement may include an MMOG game to support mission rehearsals and mission planning. The requirement  will allow stimulation of mission (formerly battle) command systems and other training aids, devices, simulations, and simulators (TADSS). This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br>     3.  Real Time Strategy (RTS)<br>      Plans for FY13 and beyond may include procurement of an RTS game to support full spectrum operations. This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br>     4.  Turn Based Strategy (TBS) <br>     Future procurement endeavors may include a TBS game to support decision making skills at all force echelons. This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br>Constraints<br>	1.  The contractor shall provide all the features of VBS2.<br>	2.  The contractor shall use industry standards for model, terrain and other content imported into the game. <br>	3.  The Flagship will be capable of importing and exporting Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) simulation terrain and Common Moving Models as well as One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) behavioral models.<br>VBS2 FEATURES:   VBS2 software is currently available for purchase.  Once the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) is posted, the Government will provide copies to potential offerors as temporary Government Furnished Information.<br>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates this requirement be fulfilled by a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government intends to award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  Interested parties are requested to review the requirements and information stated herein and to submit a written response by the closing date of this posting.  The industry feedback received will allow PEO STRI to validate cost and schedule projections in order to allocate funds to satisfy this requirement.<br><br>QUANTITIES:  The acquisition will be for an Army-wide or enterprise license for one or more commercial games.<br><br>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  Approximately $25 million over five years. The majority of the cost is expected to be an annual licensing fee that includes an update and technical support for the software.<br><br>RESPONSES REQUESTED:  The Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) requests contractors who are are a part of the existing PEO STRI Omnibus II (STOC II) Contract and Contractors who are responding to the duplicate SSN posted on FEDBIZOPPS must submit their responses to all the following POC's Michael.Adorno@us.army.mil, Richard.Boast1@us.army.mil; Eric.Hertl@us.army.mil with a copy to Leslie.Dubow@us.army.mil and Wallace.Tennille@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Companies wishing to participate in this effort MUST have a current Top Secret Facility Clearance issued by Defense Security Service (DSS).  While classified material will not be stored by the contractor, the facility clearance is required for the company to be responsible for the security clearance of their employees that will be required by any resulting contract.

Marine Corps Systems Command is seeking sources to provide support services in the intelligence disciplines that include, but are not limited to: All-Source, Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and Counter Intelligence.
  Contracted analysts will help fulfill commander's requirements for intelligence analysis across the spectrum of military operations.

The contracted intelligence analysts will be capable of performing the full range of functions that are done by USMC intelligence analysts in their respective disciplines including, but not limited to: standard intelligence products, custom reports and briefings provided to the â€œG-2â€ staff. Analytic methodology and products will conform to intelligence community standards, USMC Individual Training Standards, and local Standard Operating Procedures.

The contracted analysts will support forces, afloat and ashore, CONUS and OCONUS during exercises and operations for varying durations as required by the event supported.
  This may include, but is not limited to, CONUS exercises lasting a week up to OCONUS operational deployments of six (6) months or more.  OCONUS deployments may include active combat areas such as Afghanistan.

The result is anticipated to be multiple contracts awarded for a five (5) year period with the total value of all contracts awarded from the single solicitation being valued at approximately $100,000,000.00 for the five years.

We ask that companies that are both interested and qualified provide the Company Name, CAGE Code, and the Company Point of Contactâ€™s Name, e-mail address and phone number.

All future contact and information will be provided via e-mail with follow-ups coordinated via telephone.
  Only companies responding to this sources sought notice will be provided a copy of any draft Statement of Objectives and the resulting solicitation.

Facility clearances will be verified with the Defense Security Service prior to corresponding with individual companies.

Questions about facility clearances should be addressed directly with the Defense Security Service.

<DESC>DARPA-SN-12-02
<p>Fifteen (15) days after publication of this notice, the Strategic Technology Office (STO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) intends to issue a request for proposal to BAE Systems and QinetiQ North America for further development of the  Hyperadsorptive Atmospheric Sampling Technology (HAST).  DARPA requires highly specialized research, development, and technical services under its continued HAST effort. This work would build upon work performed under contracts HR0011-08-C-0055 with QinetiQ North America and HR0011-08-C-0056 with BAE Systems.  The Agency is looking for specialized research, development, and technical services to enhance and complete the development of the HAST samplers.  The selected contractor will prepare the samplers for integration with DARPA's complementary Panoptic Analysis of Chemical Traces (PACT) chemical analysis system, adsorb the trace (greater than ten (10) parts per trillion by volume) gases from up to one hundred (100) liters of atmospheric air in five (5) minutes or less, and demonstrate all capabilities in complex outdoor environments over a large volume of samples.  The selected contractor will develop a fully automated, inexpensive sampling system capable of acquiring, transporting, and desorbing trace gases found in military and urban environments.  Both of the proposed contractors have developed systems which use GPS guidance to initiate the acquisition of outdoor trace gases (any atmospheric chemical, regardless of functional groups) for subsequent high-fidelity, quantitative desorption.  The contractor selected from this limited competition, BAE Systems or QinetiQ North America, will execute a follow-on effort to the original HAST program, where their air sampling systems achieved comprehensive and rapid adsorption (&lt;five (5) minutes) and desorption (&lt;five (5) minutes) of the trace gases found in up to one hundred (100) liters of atmospheric air. The selected contractor will demonstrate a method for scaling the production of both their air samplers and the disposable sorbent cartridges to support the capability being developed under the PACT program, and demonstrate a sorbent shelf life of at least six (6) months, as well as resistance to specific environmental standards derived from MIL-STD-810G, "Department of Defense Test Method Standard for Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests."  The selected contractor will also investigate options for integrating their HAST system with existing portable chemical analysis systems for a standalone, in-field measurement capability.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the effort mentioned above.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.  Point of contact for this synopsis is Contracting Officer at DARPA-SN-12-02@darpa.mil.  See Note 22.</p>

<SUBJECT>Understanding Child Abuse & Neglect:  Policy, Research, and Practice for the Next Generation

<ARCHDATE>11122011
<CONTACT>Wendy C. Cruz, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014433086, Email Wendy.Cruz@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>This contract&nbsp;will establish a panel of independent experts under the National Academy of Sciences (Academy) to review and assess research on child abuse and neglect and identify potential research priorities for the next decade. <br /><br />The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended by Pub. L. 111-320, the CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2010, Section 104 (a)(4) requires the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to publish proposed priorities for research activities for public comment not later than 1 year after the date of enactment and every 2 years thereafter. The proposed National Academies report will be used to determine the priorities for research activities at the Children's Bureau, other Federal agencies, and the field in general.<br /><br />Research on child maltreatment has proliferated in the last two decades demonstrated by the increase in the number of new journals and other periodicals on children and youth issues. In addition, the number of researchers focusing on child welfare issues but from other disciplines has also increased. Several Federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Substance Abuse Services Administration, the Office of Juvenile Justice, and Delinquency Prevention, and the Department of Defense all have programs and research that addresses child maltreatment. Nevertheless, there has not been a comprehensive national or Federal effort to bring findings from the research, practice and policy to develop a coherent national research agenda that can guide the work for the next several decades.
<p><br />Fortunately, the field is now better positioned to apply and integrate child maltreatment research with research from other disciplines to improve practice. The research points to the complex interplay of forces across the etiology and long-term consequences of child abuse and neglect on the overall health and socio-emotional well-being of children, families, and communities. More recent research has identified a few evidence-based prevention and intervention strategies that are effective. Unfortunately, we do not have comprehensive systems in place to bring these effective interventions to scale at the system level. Other new research questions are emerging and other research methods and measures will be needed to answer the next wave of inquiry.</p>
<p>In 2000, the National Academy of Sciences released the landmark report, From Neurons to Neighborhoods, which became a catalyst for significant investment in policy, research and practice in the field of early childhood. A similar report is needed in the field of child maltreatment and the imprimatur of the National Academy of Sciences can provide leadership and direction for engaging a broad and multidisciplinary group of researchers, practitioners, and policy makers who are needed to address these issues.</p>

<p>A. Pricing Information.</p>
<p>(1) Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. <br />(i) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iii) The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 10/27/2011. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved source is: 1B3F8. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is SOL-NC-12-00007 and is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 12 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-53.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 811219, which has a size standard of $19.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A Time and Material contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. The United States Environmental Protection Agency?s Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORI A) is upgrading its RadNet air particulate radiological monitoring system. As part of this upgrade, EPA has installed air monitoring stations at outdoor locations, where they continuously collect particulate matter in ambient air on fixed filters. Stations' operators perform basic operations, primarily starting and stopping the air sampler to change filters. At most locations, a mechanical or instrument technician is not available to troubleshoot or correct problems.  During normal operation, filters are changed approximately twice a week by a local operator and mailed to a laboratory for analysis. During sample collection, the monitoring stations continuously monitor the filter for accumulation of radioactive material. The radiation measurements are stored by the monitoring station and transmitted, both automatically and on demand, via redundant communications systems that are an integral part of the monitoring station, to the EPA?s National Air and Radiation Environmental  Laboratory (NAREL), in Montgomery, Alabama. Whenever deemed necessary, NAREL remotely connects with one or more monitoring stations to initiate transfer of additional data and/or to modify operating parameters.  The monitoring stations are periodically re-calibrated in their installed locations. Calibration is accomplished by sending a calibration kit containing standards and all other necessary equipment to the station operator. Acquisition of calibration data and any necessary adjustments are made by remote interface via telemetry by personnel at NAREL, who coordinate by telephone with the station operator. The station operator assists by placing and removing standards and accessory equipment, taken from the calibration kit, as directed by personnel at NAREL.	As of September 2011, one hundred and thirty-four monitoring stations have been installed since the commencement of the system upgrade. Additional monitoring stations may be installed throughout the United States and  its Territories as requirements arise.  The contractor shall perform the following services (See attached Statement of Work): 1. Provide on-site maintenance and repair of RadNet fixed monitors;  2. Provide repair of defective monitor components;  3. Document and report inventory of spare parts;  4. Identify, test, evaluate and provide alternative replacement components; and  5.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>DATED: October 6, 2011</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL</p>
<p>1.1 Scope. The purpose of this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is to obtain commercial Contractor training support services for training on the Rolls Royce AE2100D3 engine installed on the HC-130J. At the completion of the training, students should possess knowledge of the AE2100D3 in respect to system theory and operation, system characteristics, component location, maintenance requirements, fault isolation and borescope inspection of engine components.</p>
<p>1.2 Background. The U.S. Coast Guard Force Readiness Command (FORCECOM) manages training for aircraft maintenance technicians on Coast Guard Aircraft. The Coast Guard employs a bi-level maintenance structure consisting of depot level maintenance and organizational level maintenance. The Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center coordinates depot maintenance for the aircraft, while each Air Station is responsible for organizational level maintenance. The Coast Guard operates six HC-130J aircraft from Air Station Elizabeth City, NC.</p>
<p>Currently the Coast Guard sends maintenance personnel to a propulsion course offered by the U.S. Air Force. While this training serves the purpose of providing basic entry level training on the AE2100D3 engine, the Coast Guard requires a higher level of training for experienced mechanics. This need is driven by the different maintenance practices that exist between the Air Force and Coast Guard. The Air Force maintenance practice involve removing the entire engine from the wing, replacing it with another ready for install engine (RFI) and shipping the removed engine back to Rolls Royce. On the other hand, Coast Guard maintenance practices require significant off-wing work on the engine including tear down and build up. Consequently, a higher degree of training is needed by Coast Guard mechanics.</p>
<p>Compounding the need for a higher level of engine training at the organizational maintenance level, the HC-130J is only operated at a single unit at Air Station Elizabeth City, NC. Consequently, a greater training burden exists since a quarter of the unit's personnel transfer out each year as part of the normal assignment process, and no personnel experienced in HC-130J operations report in. Thus, mechanics must be brought up to speed quicker on AE2100D3 operation than on-the-job training could provide.</p>
<p>In order to ensure safe, economical and effective operational employment of these aircraft, and in keeping with the excellent stewardship of American tax-payer resources, the Coast Guard needs personnel properly trained in maintaining the AE2100D3 engine.</p>
<p>1.3 Contractor Personnel.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The closing date for receipt of quotes is August 26, 2011 at 3:30 pm EDT. Anticipated award date is no later than September 12, 2011. Quotes are to remain effective for 60 days after close of solicitation. Offers may be submitted on company letterhead via email or fax.

804.1102	VERIFICATION OF STATUS OF APPARENTLY SUCCESSFUL OFFEROR (OCT 2010) (DEVIATION)
 
(a)	The apparently successful offeror, unless currently listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at: www.vetbiz.gov database, shall submit to Department of Veteran Affairs' (VA) Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) within five business days of receipt of written notice of its status as the apparently successful offeror, a verification application in accordance with 38 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 74 with such reasonably adequate documentary material, as necessary, establishing as follows:
 
(1)	The owner or owners of 51 percent or more of the offeror is/are service- disabled Veteran(s), Veteran(s), or an eligible surviving spouse thereof, as applicable, for the instant acquisition.  In this regard, the apparently successful offeror shall submit a VA Form 0877 to CVE via VA's VIP at: www.vetbiz.gov, internet site. This confidential and secure electronic application will enable CVE to inform the CO of the service-disabled Veteran or Veteran status of the owner(s) of the offeror without the CO having to receive and secure confidential individually identifiable information or personal health care information on this topic.
 
(2)	Eligible parties own 51 percent or more of the concern (see 38 CFR 74.3). Adequate documentation can include copies of official stock certificates, articles of incorporation, partnership agreement, operating agreement, or other similar documentation which reasonably demonstrates the percentage of ownership by eligible parties; and
 
(3)	Eligible parties control the concern (See 38 CFR 74.4). Control includes both the strategic policy setting exercised, for example, by boards of directors, and the day-to-day management and administration of business operations. Adequate documentation should include articles of incorporation, corporate by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, resumes, disclosure of any other current employment, or other relevant documentation, as applicable, which demonstrates control of the strategic and day-to-day management of the offeror by eligible parties, as applicable.
 
(b)	CVE will examine the business documents to determine if they establish appropriate ownership and control of the business from which an offer has been received.  Within 21 business days, CVE shall determine whether the firm can or cannot be verified as a SDVOSB or VOSB, as appropriate, and issue its decision thereon to the vendor in accordance with 38 CFR 74.11(e) and to the CO. The CO will use CVE's decision in making the source selection decision.
 
(c)	If a competing vendor raises a status protest prior to CVE's completion of its verification examination, the CO may rely on the status protest decision when issued.
 
(d)	This deviation will expire December 31, 2011. Thereafter, in accordance with VAAR 804.1102, COs shall only make awards to SDVOSBs or VOSBs which are listed as verified in VIP at: www.vetbiz.gov.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations including the United Nations agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Overseas Administration Team (OAT) is part of OPS and was created to meet the need for administrative support and intervention as OFDA's presence in the field grew, following the opening of regional and program offices. As more staff were permanently deployed to support emergency programs in Africa and Asia, OAT's role in administrative intervention prior to and following deployment of staff has become more significant and critical. Currently, OAT supports 19 locations worldwide with almost a hundred American and Foreign Service National staff. In 1999, OFDA instituted a program of contracted personal services contractors (PSCs) who could provide short term, on-call assistance to the office as the need arose. This program, called the Support Relief Group (SRG), has grown from an initial group of 12 to a potential pool of up to 75 contractors. The management of this program is part of the OAT portfolio.</p>
<p>The team consists of four members: the Overseas Administrative Support Team Leader, two Administrative Support Coordinators (ASCs), and an Administrative Support Assistant.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>This solicitation will provide DCHA/OFDA with expert level administrative support to OFDA overseas operations at USAID Missions and Embassies worldwide, to interact with USAID domestic offices in the support of those offices and staff, and to assist in the management of the SRG Program.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

There is also no indication as to how many samples are to be assessed foreach of the tests defined.
Answer: The statement of work attached to the solicitation defines alltesting required. Paragraph titled "Compliance with ANSI Z87.1" states that aminimum of three samples shall be tested for each test if less than threesamples are specified. It also states that the contractor shall be ableto perform the testing as defined in ANSI Z87.1-2003 and ANSI Z87.1-2010.
    It will be specified in the sample submission form which ANSI methodwe would like to follow for the testing. If there is a price differencefrom the -2003 method to the -2010 method then the contractor shall quote aprice for both. If there is no price difference then the contractor shallquote only one price and state that the price is the same for both ANSIZ87.1-2003 and ANSI Z87.1-2010.
    In addition when determining pricing the section titled "ANSI Z87.1High Velocity" attached to the solicitation defines how the high velocitytesting shall be performed and the contractor should quote a price to reflectthe work and materials required to perform the test in accordance with theSOW.<BR><BR>

DoD is also going through an IT consolidation effort to save cost. Cloud computing has been explored by many DoD organizations, such as DISA CSD, Army, Navy, USAF, USMC, and USTRANSCOM, as an efficient and cost effective way to host GIG services. There is an urgent need to develop a coherent enterprise level DoD cloud computing technical framework, architecture, and implementation guidance supporting all cloud services for DoD to ensure the interoperability of DoD clouds (e.g., private and community). Technical framework and architecture here intends to provide technical solution architecture to solve the issue of "What is the recommended interoperable DoD architecture to design, develop, and deploy cloud services (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) from the DoD cloud service provider perspective". The technical guidance for cloud computing services at the enterprise level is critical to ensure the interoperability of cloud services and improve performance of cloud services. The guidance will cover how to build interoperable private cloud services from the DoD cloud service provider perspective. The interoperable resource pooling and data synchronization across clouds are basic capability required to support SaaS, Paas, and IaaS between cloud service providers. DoD Cloud Computing Strategy and Implementation Plan are business drivers for the enterprise level DoD cloud computing technical framework and architecture.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> </span></p>

<DESC>The NRC requires contractor technical expertise to assist with the licensing and inspection program and activities for the fuel cycle facilities. The support activities to be performed by the Contractor under this contract include, but are not limited to, the following: acceptance reviews of Licensing Amendment Request (LARs), preparation of safety evaluation reports (SER), participation in site audits, support of Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) presentations, support of pre-application activities, and support for potential litigation or hearings. In addition, NMSS requires contractor support to provide access to experts with competencies, accrued knowledge, and highly specialized skills in the areas of, but not limited to; materials engineering, quality assurance, areas of structural and geotechnical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, instrumentation and control, software engineering, quality assurance, materials testing, risk analysis, health physics (to include laboratory analysis), hydrology, and fire technology.
<p>This is a non-competitive procurement under FAR 6.302-3 (Class Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition attached). A cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract was suitable in this instance due to the uncertainty involved in contract performance that does not permit costs to be established with sufficient accuracy to use a Fixed Price type contract.</p>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  
Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 12, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 115 South 84th Street, Suite 101, Milwaukee, WI 53214 on behalf of the Jesse Brown VAMC located at 820 South Damen Avenue, Chicago, IL 60612.  Purchase Request number:  537-12-1-070-0001.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition with The Advisory Board Company for training, leadership development, and membership for the nursing staff of Jesse Brown VAMC. The GLAC proposes entering into a base year with two option years FFP contract with the service provider. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: 

Technical Scope: The Contractor is responsible for all supplies and services required to provide training in nursing leadership development and a membership for nursing administrators in research based content (Nursing Executive Center or like group). 

Leadership Development must incorporate a minimum of 3 half day participant workshops for no less than 50 VA employees and one executive retreat. Additionally, contractor must provide planning support including implementation and program training, assessments, classroom learning, annual workshop, and action and asynchronous Learning for the nursing staff of Jesse Brown VAMC. The training must qualify for nursing continuing education. 
 
Membership for nursing administrators must include national membership meetings (and webcast access to the meeting), on-call expert consultation, research, data, and analytics on subjects pertinent to nursing management, live and on-demand web-conferences, onsite presentations, daily briefings available via internet, multimedia presentations. Content must minimally include the following topics: Nursing, Workforce, Performance improvement, Skill Development, and Quality. Content must come in the form of case studies, best practices, white papers, presentation, competency "tests", retreats, quality metrics, and roundtables. 

Specific duties under this contract are as follows:
1.	Faculty-led, interactive onsite workshops that develop the leadership skills most critical to achieving the organization's development and performance objectives.  World-class faculty rely heavily on experiential educational techniques, including a dynamic mix of facilitated discussions, case studies, games, multimedia, application exercises, self-evaluations, and role play to go beyond training in specific skills to actually shift participants' perspectives and attitude.  Further, faculty routinely incorporates organization-specific initiatives and data into teaching so that students quickly learn how to use newfound skills in the context of organizational issues and challenges.
2.	Faculty-facilitated, onsite Application Intensives to provide in-depth support for students in immediate application of skills to specific local problems and initiatives.
3.	Onsite Senior Leadership Workshop for the nurse executive and other senior nursing leaders.  This initial full-day workshop serves two principal functions:  elevating the ability of senior nursing leaders to support the development of nurse managers and laying the groundwork for leveraging Academy resources to achieve the desired development and performance objectives.
4.	Dedicated faculty and service team to ensure curriculum delivery and teaching is alighted with organizational priorities, and that organization-specific issues, vocabulary, and performance objectives are addressed at every session.
5.	On-demand learning through Harvard ManageMentor Plus to provide participants with interactive, online self-study coursework on key skills required to tackle common business and staff challenges.  The Harvard ManageMentor Plus system was created by Harvard Business School Publishing in collaboration with healthcare leaders familiar with the unique problems hospital employees face.  The combination of expert health care knowledge and leading business management expertise gives users an invaluable tool to facilitate leadership development.
6.	Online access to Academy worksheets, application guides, review materials, knowledge tests, and progress tracking tools.
7.	Leadership Diagnostic Survey to measure the impact of Academy coursework on participant motivation, satisfaction, and success in application of learning.  The survey can be administered in two ways.  In the Participant Self-Report, participants complete the survey and assess the impact of the program on their own development and success in applying learning.  In the Supervisor Evaluation, supervisors evaluate the growth and progress that they have seen from participants.  Results are reported back to senior leadership to provide a composite assessment of participant progress.
8.	Continuing education credits for workshop attendance and completion of application work.

Period of Performance: Base Year 10/1/2011 and two option years ending 9/30/2014

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

The Advisory Board is the only contractor that offers this type of training and research based toolsets for the nursing professional. Based on a Hoovers analysis, the Advisory Board competitors are large professional consulting firms (Delloitte, Accenture). The Advisory Board however has a niche market dominance in Hospital Administration, specifically nursing and nursing executives. They are alone in this market because they are able to pull from its member base of over 2800 hospitals nation-wide.

Additionally VA is vested in the Advisory Board's approach. Eight other VISNs utilize the services being procured under this proposed contract. The Cleveland EERC is endorsing this program to Network Directors because the national standardization of training and research is critical in allowing workforce flexibility in our VA hospitals. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

An intent to Sole Source was posted on fbo.gov on Sept 12th. One potential offeror responded indicating an interest in the work and providing a capability statement. Neither its capability statement nor its web-site indicated the type of research and data driven analysis (in the form of white papers, statistically relevant studies, and national trend development) that are offered by the Nursing Executive Center. No other potential offerors responded. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

As previously indicated, the VA has other contracts with this service provider for these services. The Jesse Brown VA has also had prior contracts for these services. The services being performed are commercial in that all hospitals can obtain membership. Thus, the Advisory Board offers these programs under a general list price. The VA is being offered these services at a 45% discount off of list. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

The COTR performed a preliminary search for like services to determine if a change in the scope of work would increase competition while maintain the same level of performance deemed necessary in the requirement. Three other like programs were examined. None offered the breadth and depth of service that the facility required. Additionally, the notice to industry of the intent to sole source did not result in a suitable substitute. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: 

None.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

McNeil and Associates, LLC 

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: 

None.

It is complete in the following specialties: adult emergency medicine, adult primary care, internal medicine, allergy and immunology, cardiovascular medicine, endocrinology, diabetes, family practice, gastroenterology, hepatology, hematology, oncology, infectious diseases, nephrology, hypertension, neurology, obstetrics, gynecology, women's health, pediatrics, pulmonary, critical care, sleep medicine, and rheumatology.  Over 4,500 leading physicians who function as authors, editors, and peer reviewers collectively write topic reviews that include a synthesis of the literature, the latest evidence, and specific recommendations for patient care.  No other clinical database has access to this original content.  UpToDate currently has over 9,000 unique topic reviews with 7,700 graded recommendations.  The UpToDate community also includes the collaborative effort of over 400,000 users who provide feedback and questions to the editorial group.  This community's combined efforts result in the most trusted, unbiased medical information available. 
Patient information is unique in that the material is evidence-based, regularly revised, state-of-the-art, written at two reading levels and concordant with the professional level material. Thus, patients and doctors can actively participate in shared decision making. UpToDate currently provides over 750 unique patient information topics. 

Many resources offer CME credit accrual but UpToDate has the distinction of being an accredited provider of point-of-care CME by the ACCME. Users are awarded ACCME Accredited AMA Category I CME for each search performed. There are no third party submissions, no additional fees and no testing required. UpToDate's CME is accredited by the following organizations, AMA, AAFP, AANP, AAPA, AAP, ACEP, ACOG, AOA & CFPC. 

UpToDate has been selected as an official educational program by eight leading medical societies in the United States including Society of Internal Medicine, The Endocrine Society, American College of Rheumatology, American Gastrointestinal Association, American Society of Nephrology, American Thoracic Society, and the American Academy of Family Physicians. These subscribers and societies recognize the high quality and value of UpToDate information.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

An intent to Sole Source was posted on fbo.gov on Sept 12th. No potential offerors responded indicating an interest in the work and providing a capability statement. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The Jesse Brown VA has also had prior contracts for these services. The services being performed are commercial in that all hospitals can obtain membership. Thus, Wolters Kluwer offers these programs under a general list price. Prices have been verified against this list price. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

The program office examined other competing information resources, including STAT!Ref, DISEASEDEX, FIRSTConsult, InfoRetriever, and DynaMed. None of these provided the same degree and breadth of synthesized knowledge or information dissemination application allowing for clinicians to provide better care.  Additionally, the VA has expended time and funding in learning the use of this application. It is vested in maintaining standardization among the VISNs in retaining this type of medical research tool. 
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: 

None.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: 

None.
