<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Albuquerque Operations Office (AL) intends to procure on a sole source basis, research and development of a short range neutralization system utilizing the Metal Storm multi-barrel 40 MM (a sole item). DOE has determined that Metal Storm is the only small business that has the technology needed for the research and development necessary to meet DOE mission needs.  The proposed contract action will utilize a weapon system with no mechanical moving parts and its ability to distribute large quantities of ammunition over a large area in an extremely short time frame and provide proof of concept that the electronic weapons system can achieve neutralization of an adversary and/or enough diversion that would afford a person safe egress from a protected facility. The system must be capable of saturating a target area between 30 and 50 meters away from the firing point in four 90 quadrants. Saturation is defined as one 40mm HE round (5m kill radius) in every 100 square meter area. The target area must be saturated within one second from activation of fire trigger.  This includes the time to remove mechanical barriers, arming and firing. Once armed the system must be capable of starting the expenditure of ammunition within two hundred milliseconds of pushing the â€œfireâ€ button. The system must not affect the target area until the system is fired, thus eliminating the use of any form of mines that are placed in the target area.  This period of performance will be for one year duration for less than $250,000. The intended contractor is Metal Storm USA Limited, 4350 Fairfax Dr STE 810, Arlington, Va. 22203.  See numbered notes 1 and 22.  The NAICS code for the procurement is 54170 for companies with less than 500 employees. This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids, nor does it represent a commitment by the government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement. The closing date of this announcement is 15 days from the date of this posting. Any responses to this intent shall be sent electronically to the Contract Specialist at ggourley@doeal.gov.

<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) intends to issue a Request for Quotation and award a purchase order to procure services for the analysis of State reports required under the Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA), which was enacted in October 1994 and reauthorized as Part A, Subpart 3 under Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary and Education Act (ESEA), as amended (20 U.S.C. 7151).  Each year, States are required to report to the Secretary of Education concerning implementation of the GFSA requirements.  The specific purpose of this procurement is to aggregate and analyze data from the GFSA State reports for 2004-2005 and to prepare a detailed final report.  The final report must include an examination of data published in reports covering collections from previous reporting years.  The report includes, but is not limited to, a description of the number of students expelled by local education agencies within States in compliance with the GFSA, as well as other information related to the types of firearms involved, referrals to alternative placements, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) status of expelled students.  This purchase order is intended as a sole source award to be made to Westat in Rockville, Maryland.  In accordance with FAR 13.104(b), the contracting officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  Westat is the principle organization with considerable expertise in collecting and analyzing GFSA data.  Over the past nine (9) years, States have submitted GFSA reports in a required format and the data has been collected by Westat for the 1995-96 through 2003-2004 school years over this timeframe.  The quality and accuracy of the data has been a recurring problem.  As a result, a considerable amount of time and effort is required to verify the data submitted and analyze data that is not necessarily comparable from state to state but, at the same time, make comparisons that will provide a national picture of the implementation of the GFSA and compliance.  Data contained in the GFSA report is receiving increasing scrutiny from the Congress, the media, and the public.  Because of the complexity of the data and the need for expert knowledge in the area of GFSA reporting, it would be extremely productive and cost effective to utilize the expertise of a source that is familiar with the issues related to this specific data collection.  Westat has the experience and knowledge that is unique to other sources that specialize in data collection in that it has built a knowledge base on the issues of the GFSA and an effective system that responds immediately to the urgent needs of this collection activity.  For this reason the continued use of Westat is crucial to meeting the needs of this Department.  However, all responsible sources may request a copy of the statement of work and submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Department.  For further information, contact Michelle Padilla at (202) 260-2648.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Herley CTI, 9 Whippany Road, Whippany, NJ 07981 to provide 18 Fixed PDRO Oscillators and 1 Tunable Local Oscillator. These oscillators are to be incorporated into an in-house satellite terminal design for delivery of a DoD customer. The satellite terminal design mandates that it be specifically matched to, and fully interchangeable with, ground station hardware that will be used by the customer in conjunction with the satellite terminals we fabricate at Rome. The existing ground station hardware is based on the above Herley-CTI PDRO and BBS series of oscillators, and these same oscillators must therefore be used in the satellite terminals we are building under the present effort. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The NAICS code is 334515. This procurement shall be awarded for using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) is soliciting proposals for research, development, integration, and demonstration of next-generation non-lethal weapons (NLW) and capabilities.  The  objective of this BAA is to stimulate applied research, development, and rapid-prototyping of a wide-spectrum of NLW technologies in an attempt to address known NLW technology gaps, to include:

·	Human effects of non-lethal directed energy exposures, to include physiological and behavioral responses.  (examples include high power microwaves (HPM), pulsed and continuous radiofrequency radiation (RFR), laser radiation, and laser induced plasma stimuli) 
·	Emerging  Directed Energy Weapons (DEW)  that have non-lethal applications – specifically counter-personnel, counter-material, and counter-capability missions (example include novel HPM, RFR, laser, and laser induced plasma sources)
·	Advanced  Materials that either provide or enhance non-lethal capabilities (examples include advanced anti-traction materials; engine suffocates, electrical and mechanical foulers, malodorants, thermobarics, NL nanoparticles; rigid foams/materials, morphing materials, and  NL payload delivery systems or payloads for long range remote engagement; and other NL reactants)
·	Human effects relating percussive and continuous sounds, incoherent light sources, and overpressures that alone or in combination would provide operational capabilities while minimizing adverse health effects (examples include exposure-response relationships resulting in glare and flashblindess, or behavioral responses resulting from aversive sounds.)  Also includes establishing either safety thresholds or probability relationship for adverse health effects for these stimuli.  
·	Development of long-range acoustic and ocular  technologies and devices that support operational requirements while minimizing adverse health consequences. 
·	Development of long-range, extended duration, wireless electro-muscular incapacitation technologies or devices (include characterization of  human effect and safety issues, miniaturization and advanced technology issues, and precision targeting) 
·	General science and technology efforts to explore new NLW technologies and payloads
·	Studies/Analyses to address technology-specific legal/treaty/public acceptability issues associated with: (1) extended duration incapacitation; (2) long-range precision engagement of threat weapon systems (counter-material); and (3) precision long-range engagement of threats (combatants vs   operating in complicated operational environments such as within crowds,  
·	Studies/Analyses to identify and research repeatable, universal, & effective technologies to stop vehicles/vessels at a distance and extended duration incapacitation of humans.  
·	Development of compact millimeter-wave (MMW) and HPM NLWs; (for example, portable active denial systems (PADS) and small remotely or hand-delivered high power microwave electronic attack systems for counter-material mission and with minimal collateral damage to adjacent electronic systems or critical infrastructures.
·	Investigations into the human behavioral and psychological  responses to new NLW stimuli.

This applied research and development effort will involve scientific investigations and studies to advance the current state of the art for  NL technologies and capabilities.  Strategically, this research will enable and expedite development of a family of next-generation NLWs to meet a broad set of documented NLW requirements and mission needs.  
PROGRAM SCOPE: The scope of this program is intentionally broad to address the wide spectrum of desired operational end-points that the funded investigations will strategically support.  Both applied and basic research in a wide spectrum of counter-personnel and counter-material technology areas is intended.  All research is intended to have the common objective of addressing the technology-gaps described above.  Strategically, this research will support the development of a family of next-generation NLWs to meet a broad set of documented NLW requirements and mission needs.  In addition to the data and technological gaps identified above, research support by this BAA is intended to enable NL capabilities that overcome the current limitations of existing NL systems.  These limitations include:

·	Limits of range, accuracy and precision
·	Limits in the effectiveness, and abilities to quantify effectiveness
·	Limits in providing a universal, repeatable, robust NL effect
·	Limits in target safety, particularly across a wide-spectrum of the population
·	Limits in deployability, to include weight and volume
·	Limits in employability, to include use in complex urban environments 
EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria in descending order of importance: (1) Quality and Technical Merit, (2) Contributions/Relevance to JNLWD and DoD, (3) Capabilities and Experience, (4) Plans and Capabilities to Accomplish Technology Transfer, and (5) Total Cost and Cost Realism. All awards made in response to this BAA will be subject to availability of government funds. Evaluations and selection or non-selection of proposals for funding will be made on the basis of the evaluation criteria listed and the overall balance considered most advantageous to the JNLWP. 
GENERAL INFORMATION: JNLWD has budgeted approximately $8.2 million for FY05, $8.4 million for FY06, $7.4 million for FY07, $16.8M for FY08 and $16.8 million for FY09. Multiple awards typically of 12-36 month duration are anticipated. Offerors should prepare proposals with a baseline period of performance of 12 months and with one or two options each with a 12-month period of performance, and with anticipated contract award dates in March 2005. This BAA will remain open for a period of one until (14 November 2005). The 5-page pre-proposals are due on or before 4:00 PM (EST), December 31, 2004, in order to be considered for FY05 funding.  The pre-proposals shall be evaluated and offerors shall be invited to re-submit formal full proposals on or before 4:00 PM (EST), 11 January, 2005 in order to be considered for FY05 funding.  Offerors must submit a 5-page original pre-proposal and six (6) copies of proposals to the administrative address for this BAA.  Invited full proposals shall follow this same process.   It is the policy of the JNLWD to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. The Government may use selected support contractor personnel from American Systems Corporation and M2 Technologies as special resources to assist in administering the evaluation of the proposals. These persons are restricted by their contracts from disclosing the proposal information or using it for other than performing the administrative task. Contractor personnel are required to sign non-disclosure statements. By submission of your proposal, you agree that your proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.
Only Government evaluators will make selections under this BAA. This announcement, in conjunction with the pamphlet BAA M67854-05-R-5009 Proposer Information Package (PIP), constitutes the Broad Area Announcement as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). Addresses for obtaining the PIP are provided at the end of this notice. A formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. In addition, the Government reserves the right to award either contracts, grants, or other instruments determined to be of benefit to the government in achieving the goals of this program. Awards are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any other JNLWD and/or Marine Corps contracts through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number. Affirmation shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in the FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any pre-proposal or proposal preparation costs. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit proposals, which will be evaluated. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research related to Non-Lethal Weapons developments. 
ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION: Offerors are required to obtain a pamphlet, BAA M67854-05-R-5009 Proposer Information Package (PIP) which will be made available to industry through the MARCORSYSCOM website:   http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil during the week of 22 November 2004.  The PIP provides further information on proposal format, the submission process, evaluation and funding processes, and other general information.

NOTE: The following provisions with a "Fill-in" MUST BE COMPLETELY FILLED OUT and submitted with the offer: 52.219-1 ALT I[FILL-IN];  52.222-25 [FILL-IN];  52.222-36 [FILL-IN]. CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a! ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi! sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment! , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a! ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi! sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment! , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.

<DESC>The goal of the Heat-Assisted Education in Armenia – Phase II Program is to build upon the success of Social Transition Program efforts and the Energy Efficiency projects and to provide the necessary tools to enable the next generation to sustain the USG assistance projects in Armenia. USAID/Armenia anticipates to award one or more fixed price contract(s)for the implementation of this program. The objective of the proposed twenty four-month program is to provide reliable heating systems and lavatories to improve the conditions at approximately 40 schools that are planned for rehabilitation/renovation during the 2005-2006 school year and the 2006 summer holiday by the Ministry of Urban Development of Armenia. 
Assistance will be provided to targeted schools countrywide.
Phase II will have the following two major interrelated components: (i). Rehabilitation/Construction of the school heating systems during the 2005-2006 school year and the 2006 summer holiday; and (ii) Rehabilitation/Renovation of lavatories in the schools. Inside lavatories will have to be renovated in those schools that have built-in sewage systems. However, as there are a number of schools that do not have built-in sewage systems, the Contractor(s) will have to install toilet facilities outside of the school building and connect them to the closest sewage system.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Rand Corporation , Santa Monica, CA.
Purpose:
SAMHSA/CSAT has a unique opportunity to participate in a public/private collaboration to conduct a systematic evaluation of a major new grant initiative, yielding results of value to the agency, to states, and to providers of service to persons with co-occurring substance abuse and mental disorders.

Despite the high degree of prevalence, costs, and national priority of co-occurring mental and addictive disorders, improving service delivery for individuals with co-occurring disorders (COD) has been hampered by the lack of definitions and approaches common to both the mental health and substance abuse communities.  The National Dialogue on Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Abuse Disorders, developed and endorsed by the collaboration of NASADAD and NASMHPD in 1998, has been promoted as a conceptual model to demonstrate how Mental Health (MH) and Substance Abuse (SA) Disorders relate to each other (co-occur), and how MH and SA treatment systems interact in serving persons with co-occurring disorders. The National Dialogue proposed a “quadrant model,” a matrix composed of combinations of Low and High severities of Mental Health and Substance Abuse problem severities
The proposed Contractor is the RAND Corporation, a non-profit, non-partisan “think tank,” dedicated to the improvement of policy and decision-making through research and analysis.  RAND Health is a division of RAND that focuses on empirical research related to health policy.  To the proposed project, the RAND Health research team will bring unequalled subject matter expertise on care for co-occurring disorders.  RAND is uniquely qualified to assist SAMHSA in the improvement of services for persons with co-occurring disorders.  Through the Building Bridges Initiative (supported by the Robert Wood Johnson and MacArthur Foundations), RAND Health is engaged in an on-going effort to identify and promote innovations in services for the target population.  In this work RAND examined how changes at the system and policy level affect the provision of evidence-based care and the challenges to achieving better outcomes.  RAND also identified differences in the available clinical evidence, program models and policy/financing approaches among the four quadrants, providing a framework for the proposed work.  RAND has worked with SAMHSA from the inception of the Co-occurring State Infrastructure Grant (COSIG) program and is currently completing a multisite study of the implementation lessons from the original cohort of COSIG grantees.  In combination, the SAMHSA demonstration and a RAND evaluation will ultimately contribute to the wider application of innovations in the treatment of persons with co-occurring disorders in public substance abuse systems across the country.  Further, through a collaboration between SAMHSA and the National Institute on Drug Abuse, RAND is working with COSIG states to develop performance indicators for serving persons with co-occurring disorders.  

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>Synopsis for the Early Detection and Rapid Response Project

The USDA Forest Service is soliciting contractors to sort and identify Scolytidae (bark beetles) from field samples in the North Eastern Region and Southern Region of the United States.  Some samples will be pre-screened and sorted by individuals at the field trapping level, while other samples will have to be identified in full by the contractor to assess the accuracy of the pre-screening.  The final list of identifications and a brief written discussion of results for a given year’s samples should be provided to the Early/Detection coordination team no later than December 15th of each year.  

The contractor must have a graduate degree in entomology with proven experience sorting and identifying Scolytidae species native to North America, 10 target species (Orthotomicus erosus, Ips sexdentatus, Ips typographus, Hylurgops palliatus, Hylurgus ligniperda, Pityogenes chalcographus, Tomicus minor, Tomicus piniperda, Trypodendron domesticum, and Xyleborus spp.), other exotic Scolytidae, and forest insects in general.  Must have the facilities and equipment required to conduct taxonomic identifications and to store specimens in a controlled environment.  

The Government will make two contract awards.  One contract will be awarded for work performed in the Southern Region and one contract will be awarded for work performed in the Northeastern Region.  The contract will be for one (base) year, with the option to renew two additional years.  Government anticipates work to begin on or around May 1, 2005.  This solicitation is opened to small and large schools and universities and to small businesses only.  All information regarding this solicitation will be released to the public on February 25, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Request For Proposal (RFP) Number: DOL059RP20078,Amendment Number 0002

The purpose of this amendment number 0002 to this RFP is to provide a response or clarification as follows:

1.  The solicitation (Section I, incorporation of FAR 52.219-17) and accompanying letter (directly under underlined, blue-bold print) both refer to 8a’s – as this is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside, what is the relevance of the 8a references?

Response:  The term 8 (a) is DELETED from this RFP in it’s entirety.


2.  Regarding the evaluation criteria, which is more important or more heavily weighted?  

Response: All as stated in this RFP.

3.  Submission requirements have verbiage for both electronic and hard copy, but seem to always require some hard copies, is that correct?

Response: No response.

4.  Is this a Base plus three years or Base plus four years (C.10)? 

Response: Base with three (3) option years combined.

5.  Are the four full-time equivalents referred to in para C.2 and C.1.4.c the same four people?  

Response: The contact recruits two people for safety and health individuals and two for worker compensation; this would be four FTEs and should be the same four people referred to throughout the RFP.

Are these four expected to fill all requirements of this contract?

Response: Yes

6.  Are the “on call experts” referred to in C.1.4.c.20 the same four as referred to in C.1.4.c/C.2?  In this instance, what is the government’s definition of “on call”?

Response:  Additional staff (over and above the four FTEs referenced in the RFP and SOW) that can be called upon for additional support- such serious accident investigations.


7.  Please specify which requirements result in this being classified as a “Major Acquisition”. 

Response: No response.

8.  Paragraph C.18, Definitions, states that “Major systems as defined below are considered ‘major acquisitions’.  Major acquisitions are subject to the requirements of OMB Circular A-11, Part 7, Planning, Budgeting, Acquisition and Management of Capital Assets.”  There is no accompanying definition of ‘Major systems’.

Response: No response.

Specifically which Capital Assets are covered under this procurement?

Response: No response.

9.  Would the government be willing to delete the requirement for an Earned Value Management System? 

Response: No, because it may involved performance concerning related Information Technology Services to be performed by the contractor.

10.  How does the government foresee using Task Orders in this contract? 

Response:  Because the initial contract awarded base on this RFP will be awarded in the amount of $0.00 (Zero) dollars.  The Government will be incrementally funding the contract by issuing TASK ORDERS, as necessary.

11.  Please define further the OASAM national office work spaces referred to C.1.4.c.9?

Response: Office space in OASAM consists of cubicles of approximately 60 square feet that contain a desk space, four or more file cabinets, telephone and computer.

12.  Paragraph C.1.4.c.11 refers to pre-occupancy inspections on new or renovated office spaces, etc.  How many of these inspections should we anticipate?  Will this requirement be limited to the Washington DC area, or is this a nation-wide requirement?

Response:  This requirement is limited to the Washington DC metro area, and anticipate 3 to 4 per year.

13.  Paragraph M.2.1.6 asks us to describe how we will conduct the transition from the incumbent contractor for SHARE goals data.  Who is the incumbent?  What is their staffing level?  Please define the SHARE goals data that this paragraph references.

Response:  SHARE is a Presidential Initiative that measures the safety and health performance of federal agencies.  There are four measures: Total Case Rate, Lost Time Case Rate, Lost Production Days, and Timeliness.  The incumbent contractor is not on board yet, so no response.

Proposals submission are due by August 18, 2005, 1:30Pm, E.S.T.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command, in support of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD), has selected 3 of the 135 white papers submitted in response to Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) M67854-05-R-5009 for further consideration.  Those offerors were verbally contacted on August 5, 2005.  While we desire to pursue many of the concepts identified, our funding limitations dictate otherwise.  As such, it is with regret that JNLWD will not be able to pursue all of the proposed concepts beyond this point .  As stated in our announcement posted in Federal Business Opportunities, the BAA will remain open until November 2005.  Therefore, we reserve the right to revisit your submission until that time should additional funding become available.

	We thank you for your interest in the mission of JNLWD.  It is only through the teaming of government and industry that this organization will be able to prepare for the changing world and remain the viable force that it has become since its inception.   Please continue to check the Federal Business Opportunities for future business opportunities with JNLWD.

	Sincerely,

<DESC>The IPV contractor will employ a supplier/manufacturer network with the resources, finances & supply chain management capability to support planned & un-planned requirements.  The logistics solutions will integrate the various sources of supply, thereby achieving robust competition at the supplier level, while still providing seamless interface with DLA & its Air Force customers.  This sophisticated logistics solution requires a continuous open exchange of information between customer, supplier network & DLA.  A seamless logistics system with state-of-the-art information technology (IT) & assured communications is essential for optimum support & total asset visibility.  This program provides total supply chain management in support of consumables used in maintenance, repair & overhaul of Air Force weapon systems.  The contractor will employ a combination of commercial & government-DLA sources of supply in the performance of logistics support.  The contract will also include provisions in support of Worldwide Demand (WWD) requirements for selected items; Just-in-Time support; & at least a 99% fill rate for all schedule of item requirements.  This solicitation's customer base are three Air Logistic Centers (ALCs): Warner Robins, GA; Oklahoma City, OK; and Ogden, UT.  The contract scope includes approximately 52,000 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) with a total estimated annual value of  $75,000,000.00.  The Market Basket shall consist of commercially sourced items which represent the profile of commercially sourced items for the contract term, which are a subpopulation of the schedule of items.  Some items will be designated WWD & some will be designated site specific.  Unanticipated non-repetitive requirements will be supported by Spot-buys which are acqisitions based on customer urgency.  For each NSN on the Market Basket and the subsequent contract, offerors are required to provide a unit price & a total price for each NSN, a material management price and a grand total evaluated price (Note: All estimated prices are fully burdened to include Material cost, Profit & F.O.B. Destination).  It is the Government's intent to issue an Indefinite Quantity, Fixed-Priced with EPA contract.  The solicitation will contain a 3-year base period with two (2) 2-year options and one (1) 3-year option.  The solicitation will utilize 'Best Value Source Selection' procedures.  The government will consider other factors in addition to price when evaluating proposals to determine the best overall expected value.  Technical merit is considered significantly more important than price.  The evaluation factors will be Technical Merit; Past Performance; Socio-Economic Consideration; Javits-Wagner-O'Day considerations & DLA Mentoring Businesses Agreement Program.  Just-in-Time deliveries to Air Force sites (not the World Wide demand requirements) will be required.  Offerors will be required to submit a delivery schedule for the WWD quantities for each of the items listed in the Market Basket.  Note: Deliveries may vary among product lines; offerors are required to provide a delivery schedule for each.  The Trade Agreement Act applies to all items except those in FSG 95. The deadline for receipt of proposals will be forty-five (45) days from the solicitation issue date.  DSCP plans on conducting site visits approximately two or three weeks after the solicitation issue date.  The Schedule-of-Items and the Market Basket can be obtained, WHEN THE SOLICITATION IS ISSUED, by accessing the DSCP website at www.dscp.dla.mil./gi/general/ipvsites.html. Correct web address is www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/general/ipv.htm

The Contracts will be awarded to Prime Vendor contractors utilizing "trade off" source selection methods with technical merit being more important than price. This is an unrestricted acquisition. Performance period for the base year is 15 Nov 2005 – 14 Nov 2006.

<CONTACT>Maria Hayes, 703-695-8651
<DESC>The following questions were received from an interested party. Response follows. NOTE: RFQ due date remains the same. Q1.  Regarding solicitation W74V8H-05-T-0232, in reading the RFQ factor 3, past performance, it seems there is a requirement that the offerer has produced similar documentations on the same subject of eye witness testimonials to regime atrocities and repre ssion in Iraq. Are offers from documentary film companies without such specific experience going to be equally evaluated and encouraged for submission?   A1.  The selection of a successful offeror for any contract resulting from this solicitation will be based upon a judgment of 'best value'.  As such, documentaries and eye witness testimonial gathering in general is qualifying experience and a record of pa st performance; however, offerors with specific experience and past performance applying this general qualifying record in Iraq, and with Iraqi witnesses would logically merit more weight than an offeror that does not have such pointed Iraqi experience and  past performance.      Q2. Has there been past contracts for this work, and if so is this a related project to a past contract? If so, are there offerers the government is anticipating will provide this work based on past contract work?  A2.  Yes. This is a full and open competition, and all offerors are afforded an equal opportunity to compete.  There has been one predecessor contract for the same work.  The Government anticipates that competition for these requirements exists.        Q3. How will eye witness interviews be coordinated? Will there be government personnel working with the production company to arrange and coordinate filming locations and interview subjects?  A3:  The conduct of all work for these requirements will be performed by the successful offeror, and will be as planned by the offeror, and as contained in his technical proposal.  The Government will not provide production support.     Q4. Is transportation for the film crew the sole responsibility of the contractor both to and from Iraq and for getting around once in Iraq? A4.  Yes.  Q5. Is the contractor responsible for their own security while in Iraq?  A5:  Yes.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to obtain a Trimble Kinimatic Global Positioning system (GPS) 5800 with kit including software: Research is being conducted on the spatial organization of numerous commercially, economically and ecologically valuable NOAA resources in the coastal zone.  Real-time Kinematic (RTK) accuracy of the position within 1-2 centimeters of their true location in the surface of the earth is needed in order to relocate study sites and conduct scientifically valid studies of resource distribution.  The Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR), at Beaufort, NC has currently state- -of-the art Digital Global Positioning System (DGPS) technology previously purchase from Trimble, including the hardware and the software systems that allow integration of Trimble software and data loggers for data collection and processing.  To be considered interest parties must be able to demonstrate their ability to provide a kit that meets the following minimum functional requirements: 1) Horizontal and vertical accuracy: Initially, CCFHR purchase Trimble GPS receivers and software in 1990. The Trimble receivers and software have been upgraded through the years and have provided reliable and accurate data.  There GPS receivers have proven dependable and durable collecting data in the marine environment.  The Trimble 5800 GPS receiver package is compatible and integrates with the laboratory’s present Trimble data collectors and software and ESRI Geographic Information System (GIS) software.  The Trimble 5800 GPS package consists of two (2) fully integrated compact units with 24 channel GPS/WAAS/EGNOS receivers, dual frequency GPS antenna, UHF radios, Bluetooth communications and internal batteries.  The rover unit is cable-free and lightweight for all day field use.  With the 5800 base station setup, the rover collects real-time kinematic (RTK) data of 1cm horizontal and 2cm vertical accuracy with minimal occupation time per point.  The highly accurate horizontal and vertical data is needed for research projects, such as studying depth limits of seagrass, effects of boat wakes on marine habitat and adjusting the vertical measurements to tidal datums and relating to sea level rise research concerns.  The 5800 receiver collects WAASH and EGNOS real-time differential positions without a base station. 2) Compatibility with present Trimble GPS hardware and software:  The CCFHR at Beaufort, NC has previously invested in state-of-the art DGPS technology from Trimble, including DGPS hardware and pathfinder and Terrasync software systems and ESRI Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that allows integration of the GPS signals.  Studies are conducted in geographically remote areas where a backup GPS unit is necessary for consistent data collection.  The Trimble 5800 unit will enable the user to establish local horizontal and vertical control where geodetic monuments are infrequent or have a less than desirable accuracy when setting up a GPS base station.  The Trimble unit allows consistent data collection and updating of existing GIS data layers to ensure seamless research database.  To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the exact equipment or comparable.  Provide descriptive literature and specifications for the equipment that meets the requirements stated herein. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this equipment previously. 
 This notice is for equipment for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties must respond within (10) days after publication of this notice. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue a purchase order to the Duncan-Parnell, Morrisville, NC.  Faxed information can be sent to 816-426-7530, Attn: Sharon Walker. The Central Region Administrative Division (CRAD) requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/.

<DESC>DESC: Service Sources Sought to conduct a study on the effects on hurricanes on the distribution of Johnson’s Seagrass (Halophila johnsonii)

The Central Region Administrative Division (CRAD), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries (NMFS) in St. Petersburg, FL intends to acquire services from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, (UNCW) , Center for Marine Conservation in Wilmington, NC to examine the impacts of storm damage from hurricanes on Johnson’s seagrass. Johnson’s seagrass is a threatened species whose core population is located in the eastcoast of Florida.  H.johnsonii occurs in areas highly influenced by changes in the environment especially extreme events such as hurricanes, which can greatly affect salinity, depth, clarity and color of the water.  Determining how hurricane-inducted changes in salinity and optical characteristics of the water column might affect the distribution of Halophila johnsonii are critical to the preservation and recovery of this species.  Recent field observations suggest that spectral-irradiance alterations related to water clarity may cause shifts in abundance and depth distributions of H. johnsonii and the co-ocurring conspecific H. decipiens. The UNCW, Center for Marine Conservation, has seagrass physiological ecologist and is the only known source with current research experience working on Johnson’s seagrass photophysiology and bio-optical properties of coastal waters. UNCW has conducted research on this species photophysiology in response to changes in light and salinity tolerance and has also conducted research on the optical properties of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in coastal systems. UNCW is the only know source with researchers to accomplish this project. The government only knows of one source for this service the University of North Carolina, Center for Marine Science, Wilmington, NC. To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the service and satisfy the Government’s needs. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this service previously, and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this service.

<RESPDATE>091505
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Shawn J Ryan, Contract Specialist,  619-553-7502
<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION. This Request for Information (RFI) seeks information about existing automatic data fusion capabilities that may apply to processing multi-INT data for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  MDA data fusion focuses primarily on generating and maintaining tracks on vessels approaching US shores with extension to tracking vessels world-wide. This RFI also requests information on analysis tools that may be used for MDA including data mining, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. The capabilities must be automated to handle large quantities of data and have the functionality to process disparate data types (Signals Intelligence (SIGINT, Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Infrared Intelligence (IRINT), Acoustics Intelligence (ACINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), etcâ€¦). 2. NOTICE. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at responder expense. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP if issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information. 3. BACKGROUND. In response to the recent Presidential Directive on Maritime Security, the DHS Sponsored MDA Senior Steering Group (SSG) recently completed the Initial Draft MDA Technology Roadmap with representation from DoD, DHS, DOE, and numerous other government departments and agencies. This MDA Roadmap identified fusion as one of the greatest challenges to U.S. maritime security.  DHS has the responsibility to identify commercial MDA fusion technologies for follow on national investment.  The purpose of this RFI, therefore, is to identify the most current MDA related fusion activities that could support and guide this critical investment. Pursuant to the RFI, follow on MDA Community RDT&E efforts will focus on automatically monitoring commercial and recreational maritime traffic. These efforts will also include automatic high-fidelity vessel tracking, establishment of traffic patterns, and automatic detection of anomalous vessel behavior.  Therefore automatic fusion algorithms will be required to form an accurate, comprehensive fused maritime Common Operational Picture (COP). 4. INFORMATION REQUEST. Pertinent information on these automatic data fusion capabilities is provided in the attached survey questionnaire.  Please respond to each question as completely as possible. Additional information may also be included, provided it falls within the specified eleven (11) page limit. 5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS. In order to evaluate the offerorsâ€™ Data Fusion activities, responses must include: (1) A cover page with company name and address, with business and technical contact information to include e-mail, fax, telephone, and web page. (2) Identification of any existing federal government contracts for the Activity, including agency, agency point of contact, and contract / purchase order number. (3) A response to the Survey Questionnaire.  The Survey Questionnaire is available at the SPAWAR e-Commerce Central web portal. All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to eleven pages.  All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as business confidential or proprietary will be fully protected from release outside the government. Responses must be submitted via the SPAWAR e-Commerce Central web portal at https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil/. Questions regarding submissions may be sent to any of the POCs listed in paragraph 6. Contacts must be made by email only; special arrangements can be made if it is necessary to send additional classified information. All packages submitted electronically or by electronic media shall be free of any computer virus. If a virus is found, the package will be destroyed and a replacement will be requested, which must be provided within three days after notification. Response to this RFI must be submitted to the SPAWAR e- Commerce Central web portal not later than 1:00 pm (PDST) on September 15, 2005. 6. POINTS OF CONTACT.  Please direct any questions to: Ms. Christine Barton,  MDA Data Fusion Survey  POC, SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego (SSC-SD), Email: cbarton@spawar.navy.mil, or Ms. Joan Kaina, SSC-SD, Email: joan.kaina@navy.mil or Dr. Stephan Hobbs, SSC-SD, Email: steve.hobbs@navy.mil or Ms. Abby Westerman, Deputy Program Development, ISR Department SSC- SD, Email: abby.westerman@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Real Time Weight and Balance System
<DESC>C-130 Real-Time Weight and Balance System (RTW&BS) Request for Information (RFI)
	
This is a request for information and not a solicitation.


INTRODUCTION:
The Government is interested in obtaining information concerning a C-130 RTW&BS. This program includes efforts to design, develop, manufacture, install and test one C-130 RTW&BS.  HQ AMC has determined the need for RTW&BS capability on the C-130 aircraft.  All manufacturers that propose a bid to design and build the RTW&BS must have a Federal Aviation Administration certificate that certifies the company to design and build equipment that will be used on airborne aircraft. The vendor must also comply with all military specifications on material used in the system. Upon completion of the effort, all designs, drawings and proprietary rights to the project will be relinquished and turned over to the United States Air Force.

1. SCOPE.
This request for information is directed to competitive potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in the design, development, integration, and test of airworthiness certified aircraft modifications.  The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine the strategy for the development of the C-130 RTW&BS.  Further, this information will help the Government structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks.

2. OBJECTIVES.  
The main objectives in this project are as follows:
1. Better attain information for meeting a current requirement (AF1067-AMC 04-226)
2. Design and build one airworthy and certified RTW&BS prototype.

3. REQUIREMENTS.
The Onboard Weight and Balance System shall have real time capability for determining the weight and center of gravity (CoG) of the C-130 aircraft prior to flight.  The following are operational and aircraft system specifications or limitations applicable to the design and development of this System:

3.1	Operational:  The weight of an aircraft is determined through a combination of actual weighing, accurate record keeping, and proper use of the aircraft’s –5 series technical orders (TOs).  Floor loading is the weight, in pounds, of a load divided by area of floor on which it rests.  The aircraft’s –5 and –9 series TOs usually specify the floor loading limits and/or weight limits for the various aircraft compartments.  System capability shall provide for aircraft gross weights within the range of 70,000 lbs to 180,000 lbs.
  
3.1.1	The System shall demonstrate the capability to repeatedly and consistently determine the weight and CG values to within an accuracy of +/- 1%.
  
3.1.2	The System shall have the capability to accomplish and display a typical weight and CoG calculation within two minutes, as well as the capability to repeat the calculation process within a five minute recovery period.

3.2	Airframe:  For design purposes, the System shall be capable of interfacing with the basic C-130E or C-130H aircraft configurations.

3.3	Landing gear: The integrity of the landing gear system shall not be altered to the extent that the operational capability of the landing gear system is compromised or negatively affected. Although landing gear parameters, characteristics, stresses, etc. may be monitored or cycled as part of the System’s analytical process, the landing gear struts shall not be modified in any way that would alter or change the existing strut configuration.
 
3.4	Hydraulics:  Hydraulic power for operation of the System (if required) is available from the aircraft auxiliary hydraulic system. The output of the auxiliary hydraulic pump is 6.0 GPM @ 3,000psi. The approximate volume of this hydraulic system is 6.6 gal. 

3.4.1	Interconnections to the aircraft hydraulic system shall incorporate a remotely operated isolation feature capable of separating the two systems in the event of an emergency or unanticipated need for auxiliary hydraulic power.
 
3.4.2	Interconnection or isolation of the two systems shall not compromise the capability of the auxiliary hydraulic system to perform its normal operation. 

3.4.3	In the event the System design utilizes an integral hydraulic power source, such a system shall be completely “closed” (i.e., it shall operate independently from the aircraft’s hydraulic system so that respective hydraulic fluids do not intermix). 

Electrical: The System shall be compatible with existing C-130 electrical systems.  The power available is 28-volt DC, as well as 400 HZ, 115-volt, 3-phase AC.  Since the need for weight and balance values are likely to be required without aircraft engines running, it shall be assumed that the electrical power available will be that limited by the aircraft’s auxiliary power unit (APU), Gas Turbine Compressor (GTC) or electrical power cart.


4. GENERAL INFORMATION.
Note: FAR Clause 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) applies as follows:

Statement of Work for " GEOSPECIFIC TERRAIN MODELING FOR GAME ENGINES "                                                                 11 August 2005 BACKGROUND.  The USMC is seeking contractor support to conduct a one time independent, unbiased analysis of Global Mapper software and its ability to provide geo-specific 3D terrain models for use in Virtual Battle Simulations (VBS) 1, utilizing NGA source data (elevation, culture data, and imagery). VBS-1 is currently utilized for stand-alone and local network training of individuals and small units but is restricted to geo-typical and proprietary terrain models. The Technology Division for the Marine Corps Training and Education Command is considering ways in which to provide geo-specific terrain models for all virtual simulations. Therefore an analysis which identifies proprietary issues for current game engines (VBS-1 for the purpose of this analysis) and the issues with interfacing geo-specific terrain models produced from COTS/GOTS tools (Global Mapper for the purposes of this analysis) is desired.  Proposals shall be submitted to me by e-mail to shelly.parker@mms.gov. 1.	OBJECTIVE. The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide USMC Training and Education Command with an analysis of 3D terrain produced by Global Mapper tools to be utilized in VBS-1.   2.	SCOPE OF WORK and TASKS. Provide a written analysis in MS Word format identifying the input data VBS-1 needs/can accept and the data NGA can provide.  The report will also examine the capability of the GM application to convert NGA data into the formats usable by VBS-1.  This will include investigating other COTS/GOTS applications, such as Terrex Terra Vista Pro, and ESRI products, that can do the necessary data format conversions.  The vendor must evaluate the applications to determine if they are suitable for use by an operator with no formal training other than training offered with the mapping tools. For instance, an individual who has learned certain mapping basics such the meaning of raster, vector, datum, and projection and can perform simple tasks with mapping software.  The report must address the following: a.	Review and analyze the VBS1 application and documentation to determine its mapping data requirements and limitations. b.	Review and analyze NGA source data. c.	Summarize, document and submit to TECOM the information learned about the VBS1 application and NGA data. d.	Review and analyze the GM application and documentation to determine GM's capability to process NGA data and output data in the formats required by VBS-1.   e.	If GM was found acceptable in the previous step, test it using NGA data and VBS-1 to determine if (1) it performs as advertised and (2) its ease of use is suitable for its intended TECOM role and users. f.	Review information on other gaming software with an emphasis on applications the government has developed or already has the right to use to determine if those applications can perform the desired conversions.    g.	Review information on other mapping software with an emphasis on applications the government already has the right to use to determine if those applications can perform the desired conversions.   h.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

SECTION C – STATEMENT OF WORK

The government is procuring two (2) Underway pC02 systems

 Technical Specifications: 

1.  INTRODUCTION
As part of a multi-year effort to quantify the flux of carbon dioxide between the ocean and atmosphere under NOAA's climate forcing portfolio, systems to measure partial pressure of CO2 are being placed on volunteer observing ships and research ships.  To date, the systems have been built in-house or under contract by an individual.  Because of the increased scope of the effort, we seek a commercial vendor to build the units to the exact and exacting specifications listed below.  To assure conformity these criteria are based on the three current systems operated by the AOML/CO2 group and a dozen additional systems operated by national and international partners. 

Specifications:
The system to measure surface seawater carbon dioxide concentrations must fulfill stringent performance criteria determined via community consensus at a workshop on underway pCO2 systems, held in Miami Oct 2 and 3, 2002.  (See, www.aoml.noaa.gov/ocd/pco2).  AOML will certify that the systems meet the criteria listed below.  The specifications of parts are based on performance, robustness and extensive experience with our current systems in operation.

Overall system accuracy:
The systems should measure ambient air CO2 levels with an accuracy of better than 0.1 ppm (parts per million) out of 370 ppm.  The equilibrated surface water values should be accurate to 2 micro atmospheres.  This accuracy will necessitate pressure measurements to be within 0.2 mBar and water temperature measurements to be within 0.01 C.

Overall system description:
The systems are patterned after those in operation and described in Feely et al, (1998) and Wanninkhof et al, (1993).  It must operate fully automatically and include:
1) A showerhead equilibrator that partitions CO2 in seawater into a headspace gas; 

 2) A valve box to select, monitor and control flows of equilibrator, ambient air, and gas standards; and a location to accommodate a user supplied infrared analyzer to quantify the CO2 content in equilibrator headspace gas and ambient air;
 3) A personal computer-based software interface to log data and control valves and telemeter data.  Pressures in the infrared analyzer and equilibrator must be measured, along with gas and water flows, and temperature of water in equilibrator.  Water flow should be 1.5 L/min or less, and gas flows 30 ml/min.
4) An iridium transmitter and antenna to telemeter data via satellite to shore

The system must include a pressure regulator to adjust water inlet pressure from 5 to 30 psi and  bulkhead ports to  connect at least four gas standards (user supplied) for automatic calibration 

Parts: 
The following components should be used in production unless is can be unequivocally shown that alternate parts improve accuracy and robustness.  
Analyzer:  The system must be built to interface with a user provided LICOR 6262 analyzer.  This infrared analyzer can measure the water vapor concentration in the air stream, which is essential to determine the proper mole fraction of CO2.  The user (AOML) will provide the analyzer. 
Multiport valve:  A multi-port Valco valve (model ECMT2SD8MWE) must be used to select the gas to be analyzed from at least 4 compressed gas standards, equilibrator headspace and ambient air. 
Pressure transducer:  Setra model 239, Vaisala (PTB210C6C1M) or Druck (RPT350) barometer 
Equilibrator:   A small volume showerhead equilibrator. Water must be filtered with a 200-micron filter prior to entering the equilibrators.
Filter cleaning: The water filter must be able to be cleaned autonomously, for instance by back flushing with fresh water.
Drying of headspace gas:  Headspace gas should be dried to a dew point of < 15C using thermoelectric condenser block and a Permapure dryer with a  dried sweep gas. 
Tubing material:  1/8" 316 stainless steel tubing should be used.
Enclosures:  Separate watertight enclosures should be built to contain the equilibrator and its peripheral components with approximate measurements 22”H x 22 “W x 10 “D) and one to contain the valve, IR analyzer, and their peripheral components which should be made of metal and have approximate measurements of 20” Hx24”W x 12’D
Instrument interface:  A PC-based Lab View software  system must be provided  to automatically control the instrumental operations and log data from IR analyzer and sensors.  Data to be logged include time and position from a GPS, IR  analyzer response, equilibrator temperature, barometric  pressure, and flow meter readings. The software will be able to telemeter data to shore via an iridium satellite modem.  A second program  will receive the data shore side  and be able to plot data from all instrumental sensors.  The Iridium protocol will be provided by PMEL.

Computer: The system has to be designed such that control occurs through USB or RS-232 ports. The computer will be supplied as part of the package
Operating manual:  The system must be supplied with an operating manual including manuals, and calibration sheets of the individual components.

52.232-16 Progress Payment . Progress payments will be based on total cost of the contract. Commercial advance payments will not exceed 15 percent of the contract price. Because of the cost of materials involved in purchasing the system and to accommodate small businesses to bid on manufacture of this equipment, 15 % of the purchase price will be paid by NOAA at signing of the contract (for materials only) and the remaining 85% will be paid based on a percentage or stage of completion.

<DESC>The USDA, ARS, LSO intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source Steris, 2424 West 23rd St., Erie, PA 16506 to upgrade two Steris Eagle 2000 Gravity Sterilizers to Eagle 3000 gravity specifications to meet current performance and safety standards.  This involves replacement of the entire   control system with Steris 3000ISO controls, replacing Bio-Seals, adding Steris trap cooling modification kit, adding Steris jacket water sensor and adding Steris impact printer and accessories. These modifications will make the two existing units equivalent to new units.  The BioSeal will increase biological security by preventing leaks.  The control system will upgrade performance and add new levels of safety in operation.  This upgrade will also allow easier interface with existing monitoring systems.  The impact printer will produce more permanent records of operation.  The trap cooling modification will greatly reduce the amount of cooling water required, which will reduce laboratory water and sewage costs. This procurement will be made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(2) (C)(ii).  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Interested parties should submit written responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 7 calendar days after publication of this notice.  It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available.  If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Steris without further notice.  This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is August 23, 2005.

Payment: Any award made under this solicitation is subject to 31 CFR Part 208 that requires all payments made by the government to be made by electronic funds transfer.  Vendors may meet this requirement by acceptance of government purchase card or providing a Vendor Express Number.  If a company has not previously enrolled in the Vendor Express Program with USDA, they should call the National Finance Center at 1-800-421-0323 for an enrollment package.

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  Line Item 0001: The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, Active Radioactive Materials (RAM) Waste Monitor.  

Description
This is a request for bids for one Tool/Bag RAM monitor for measurement and clearance of potentially contaminated items. The monitor shall have a large capacity measurement volume (minimum 50 x 50 x 50 cm) for clearing waste generated by typical RAM laboratory facility.  The laboratory uses a variety of radiation sources, emission types, and energies including low energy 
X-ray (about 36 keV), high energy gamma (1.3 Mev) and moderate to high energy betas (45 KeV to 1.7 MeV).   Isotopes to be detected include C-14, S-35, Cl-36, Fe-55/59, Co-57/58/59/60, Ni-56/59, Sr-89/90, Y-90, Tc-99/m, Mo-99, I-125/129/130/131, Pd-103, Cd-109, Cs-137, P-32, Am-241, Pu-239, and U-238.

Functional Requirements
The detectors may employ a combination of detectors (proportional counters either sealed tube or gas flow and plastic scintillators with photomultiplier tubes)  to satisfy the required detection capabilities for the broad range of energies and emissions listed above.  The system shall consist of a minimum of five detectors; At least two (2) of which shall be large area detectors configured to efficiently detect gamma emitting radionuclides above 50 keV (presumably plastic scintilators), and three (3) of which shall be large area detectors configured to detect beta and low energy x-ray ( 36 KeV) emissions (presumably proportional detectors ¡V either sealed or gas flow). These shall be arranged to maximize detection efficiency and coverage of the interior surface of the chamber creating approximately 4 pi detection geometry (at a minimum top, bottom, sides, and back wall of the chamber).  External background signal shall be suppressed by surrounding the detectors and counting chamber (top, bottom, sides, and door) with a minimum of 10 mm lead or equivalent shielding. Additionally the system shall be able to actively monitor the back ground when not in use and apply this background subtraction to determine net counting results.  All computer displays, electronics, controls, indicator lights, keyboard/pad, are located on top of the monitor or in a manor allowing ergonomic use of the system by one individual.  Count cycles shall be initiated either by simply closing the door or by a simple push button.   Monitor results with the date, time background, net count, and result of check ¡§OK¡¨ or ¡§Alarm¡¨ shall be displayed with sufficient time to allow the user to record results. Alternatively the system may provide a printout or computer saved record of the results that would be readable by the user.  The user interface shall allow the users to set detection limits, count cycle, and alarm parameters, perform QA and calibration functions, and select output units and formats.  The interface shall be menu driven for easy use by a technician without requiring substantial reference to operations manuals or line editor programming skills.   The unit shall include any or all ancillary items needed for full and complete turnkey operation including but not limited to: power cords, surge protectors, input key boards, output printers and cables, video displays, gas regulators, transport carts, shielding, and detector cables and tubing.  

Detector Characteristics
The system shall utilize detectors capable of detecting contamination from beta-, gamma-, and X-ray emitting radiation sources including: C-14, S-35, Cl-36, Fe-55/59, Co-57/58/59/60, Ni-56/59, Sr-89/90, Y-90, Tc-99/m, Mo-99, I-125/129/130/131, Pd-103, Cd-109, Cs-137, P-32, Am-241, Pu-239, and U-238.  The detectors may employ a combination of proportional based detectors (either sealed tube or gas flow) and plastic scintillators with photomultiplier tubes.  (Vendors may optionally propose using solid state detectors.  However they must provide documentary evidence that they will meet the same or better performance, detection, and background suppression specifications that are available with the other detectors. They shall also provide similar documentary evidence of reliability, stability, reparability, and cost effectiveness).  

The system shall be capable of detecting and alarming for activities above 2 nanocuries with a counting time not greater than 5 minutes while operating in a moderate to low external background field up to 0.2 mr/hr.

Typical values of the minimum detectable activities and the supporting calculation and measurement data shall be provided for the radiation sources to be monitored.  These shall be compared as a best value criterion for evaluation of the proposal.   

If a gas-flow based detector is proposed, the counter shall use a standard P-10 counting gas.  Gas flow shall be monitored and controlled by the system and designed to minimize gas flow during times of inactivity and purge the chamber following a shutoff.  The detector voltage shall power down automatically with a signal of low flow to prevent damage to the detector and prevent operation that could report erroneous measurement results.  A low flow indication shall be displayed visually and/or audible either via the controlling computer or the instrument.  The system shall require at most 30 minutes to purge and stabilize following an extended shutdown.  

The system shall be capable of operating in the temperature range of 0„aC to 45„aC (32„aF to 113„aF).     The system shall meet performance requirements without fluctuation or adjustment in operating parameters for normal variations in laboratory environmental conditions with room temperature 15 - 32 degrees C, and relative humidity 20 - 70 percent.

The system shall operate on standard AC power at 115 to 125 Volts at 60 Hz.  

The monitor shall have a large capacity measurement volume (minimum 50 x 50 x 50 cm) for clearing waste generated by typical RAM laboratory facility.   The Floor of the counting chamber shall be capable of supporting items up to 50 lbs without damaging the detectors.  The sides and top of the chamber shall include a mesh screen or grate or liner covering to minimize potential for puncturing, scraping or otherwise damaging the detectors.   This shall be designed to minimize degradation of detection efficiency while still reducing potential for detector damage due to normal placement and removal of monitored bags. (a mesh comparable to those use on personnel contamination monitors would be sufficient). All internal surfaces shall be designed for easy decontamination and/or removal.

The instrument shall be self contained and semi portable.  The system shall be fully incorporated onto its own wheeled cart.  The system (including computer, electronics, display, and output device but not necessarily the gas bottle) shall be capable of being moved by one individual, without disassembly or technical support from the manufacturer.

The system shall be designed for ease of maintenance and repair. The internal lining and detectors shall be capable of being removed, cleaned, or replaced by NIST personnel without undue difficulty or use of specialized tools unless such tools are provided.  If proposed, gas-flow proportional detector windows shall be removable for cleaning or replacement by NIST staff in the event of damage or contamination, and a replacement gas-flow proportional window shall be included with the system. 

NIST HP staff shall be able to perform full setup of monitor results, alarms, thresholds, system parameters, operating cycle for duration of measurement times, and gas-flow controls parameters via simple menu driven users interface.  

Count cycle times shall be variable and selectable by NIST staff ranging from 10 seconds up to fifteen minutes.  (Alternatively count times may be adjusted automatically based on desired alarm set point, MDA, and background algorithms). 

Monitor output shall report date, time, ¡§Alarm¡¨, ¡§OK¡¨ or ¡§Clean¡¨, background value, and support units such as gross and net counts and/or count rates, (Counts, CPS, or CPM) measured activities in disintegration rates as reported in disintegrations per minute and/or  standard units for activity(multiples or fractions of Bq and Ci) , and minimal detectable activities in the same units as measured activities.  The ¡§Alarm¡¨ and threshold shall be based on user-specified levels.

All system documentation, operation maintenance, repair manuals, and required software along with backup disks of the programs for reinstallation shall be supplied.  A listing of all proprietary items, system requirements, current costs, and replacement lead times shall be included with the documentation.

Business Considerations

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is TIRSE-05-Q-00047, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-05. This acquisition is set-aside for small business. The NAICS code is: 561730, and the small business size standard is: $6 Million.

This will be an all or none award based on the lowest price quoted from a responsive, responsible quoter. Quotes will be considered only from quoters who are regularly established in the business relevant to the scope of work to be performed. Contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (refer to below Preparation and Submission of quotes, paragraph 3) to be awarded this contract.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) request a quotation for the following service for the period effective from date of award through a completion date to be coordinated between IRS and the contractor:

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/STATEMENT OF WORK

1. BACKGROUND

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is in need of services to correct an erosion problem at the Memphis Internal Revenue Service Center (MIRSC) at 5333 Getwell Rd., Memphis, TN.

The general facility layout includes retention ponds that are designed to catch the storm water runoff. As a result of runoff entering the ponds due to the steep grading, there are areas of erosion starting to appear. These areas are concentrated around the perimeter of the facility at the fence line and at the retention/dry ponds. 

Perimeter (fence line) erosion: The erosion between two gates (gates 3 & 4) is concentrated at the fence line where the water drains to the ditch on the north end of the property. Because there is a high volume of water leaving the property at this location, the ground under the fence is eroding. This is creating deep ‘ravines’ or cuts into the ground where the water is heaviest. 

Dry Ponds: The dry ponds are normally dry; however since they serve as secondary containment during periods of heavy rainfall, they may have water in them that will need to be removed at the time of scheduled work start. In this area, the steep grading is contributing to the erosion on both sides of the ponds. This is also causing the fence post concrete anchors to become exposed. The bottom of the dry pond will require leveling to restore proper drainage, as the soil runoff has deposited in this area and created high spots which prevent drainage. 

Retention Ponds: Around the ponds on the facility, there is rip rap to prevent erosion. The area between the grass and the rip rap is staring to erode, and the dirt has been carried down into the lower rip rap. Rip rap is needed in these areas is to fill in the thin spots. Additional rip rap is needed around the perimeter of the ponds to fill in the eroded area.

2. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The Contractor shall perform all work under this contract at the MIRSC at 5333 Getwell Road Memphis, TN  38118. Work shall commence September 12, 2005. The completion date will be coordinated between the contractor and the IRS contact based on the approved schedule (refer to paragraph 8, Schedule of Work, below).

3. GROUNDS ACCESS HOURS

a. Normal duty hours of the MIRSC are from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, daily, Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays. The facility will be available to the contractor during normal duty hours.

The contractor will not work on Federal holidays, or any other day designated by Federal Statute, Executive Order, or Presidential Proclamation, except if requested and authorization is granted from the IRS contact. 

b. Government personnel observe the following listed days as a holiday:

New Year's Day	Martin Luther King, Jr's. Birthday (observed)
President's Day	Memorial Day
Independence Day	Labor Day
Columbus Day	Veteran's Day
Thanksgiving Day	Christmas Day

Any other day designated by Federal Statute, Executive Order, or Presidential Proclamation.

4. GENERAL

a. Identification of Contractor Employees

The contractor shall provide to the IRS contact a list of names, and dates of birth of personnel who will be on-site performing work under this contract. This list shall be provided with the Schedule of Work (refer to paragraph 8 below).

5. RECORD OF ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE

Each contract employee must sign in when reporting for duty and sign our when leaving at the end of the work day. The sign-in and sign-out will occur at the entry/exit gate.

6. WORK STATEMENT

The contractor shall correct the erosion problem along the perimeter, dry ponds, and retention ponds at the MIRSC to prevent further erosion to the maximum extent practicable.

The contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, equipment, transportation, tools and materials, and shall plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective completion of all services described herein. 

Estimates of the areas requiring services, to include the size of the ponds, are provided with specific tasks as applicable. It is estimated that backfill is needed for an area approximately 1’ wide by 1’ deep. 

7. SPECIFIC TASKS

PERIMETER. At the fence line between gates 3 & 4, the contractor shall:

•	Install 3 drain boxes/catch basins and subsequent drain hose to move the water off site, along natural drain areas; fill swale with liner and river rock (The locations of the basins should be installed in accordance with the current fall of the land and swales).
•	Install corrugated pipe (under fence) draining the drain boxes to the ditch that is to the North of the fence line.
•	Install top soil to re-grade the area to proper drainage levels along the fence.
•	Install a ‘berm” along the fence line to direct water into the basins to prevent future erosion (to the maximum extent practicable) and deflect water back to the drain boxes. 
•	Install Bermuda sod over the top soil.
•	Place rip rap around the drainage boxes to prevent dirt from entering the drains. 

NOTE: Gates 3 & 4 - This area covers approximately 350’ along the fence line. 
 
DRY PONDS. At dry Ponds #1 & #2, on West fence line, the contractor shall:
•	Backfill with dirt to reduce grade at both fence line and road side of ponds to reduce the potential for erosion.
•	Lay Bermuda sod with staples over backfill dirt. 
•	Form new backfill into current pond drainage slopes, correcting any current grading deficiencies which prevent proper drainage. 

Regrading in this area, creating a less severe angle of decline, will help the erosion issue. 

Pond #1: This pond perimeter is 700’, plus an additional 100’ of fence line that needs to be built up.

RETENTION PONDS

Retention Pond #1. The contractor shall:
•	Lay rip rap inside fence perimeter over eroded areas to prevent further erosion and provide security from entry via openings in the fence at ground level. 
•	Build up existing rip rap at fence to level with bottom of fence line. 

Retention Pond #3. The contractor shall:
•	Place rip rap around the perimeter of the pond to fill in the areas where the erosion has created excessive gaps in the landscaping. 
•	Overlay rip rap over existing layers to fill in thin spots. 

NOTE: Pond #3 - This pond perimeter is 800’. 

The contractor shall add additional fill dirt as needed. 

RETENTION/DRY PONDS: Both ponds together equal approximately 1200’ perimeter. This area is in need of buildup that will change the grade to a gentle slope, which will require an advanced knowledge of the grading principles to estimate the backfill required. 

8. SCHEDULE OF WORK

The contractor shall prepare and submit a schedule of work for the project 7 working days after this order is put in place, and prior to commencement of work. The schedule of work shall, at a minimum, include the date work will begin and the anticipated completion date.

Hiring contract employees for Test Administration 
Education center – MacDill AFB
a/o 2005

Education - MIB
	HS Diploma 					= 0
	AA Diploma 					= 2
	BA/BS Diploma 				= 4
	BA/BS Education related 			= 5
	BA/BS Counseling related			= 6
	MA/MS Diploma 				= 8
	MA/MS Diploma Ed/Counseling related	= 10

Experience - MIB
None / Unsuccessful work history						= 0
	Successful, but not in a related field						= 2 
	Successful in a related field, but not within the military/government	= 4
	Successful in a related field that is with the military/governmental		= 6
	Successful in exactly same job with a DoD Education Center		= 8

Cost - MIB (bid price)
	Rank order candidates with highest bid awarded a 1, 2nd highest bid awarded a 2 and so on.  The lowest cost bid will be at the top of the list and will receive a score equal to the total number of candidates.  

Interview Results - MIB (phone, resume, meetings and etc.)
	Leadership interview candidates and/or evaluate resume packages to determine an order of merit list.   Most effective resume package is placed at the top of the list and least effective resume package is placed at the bottom of the list.   Bottom candidate is awarded a 1, second from bottom is awarded a 2 and so on.

References – MIB (Personal observations, written, phone and etc.)
	Candidates’ references will be rank ordered in an order of merit list by leadership with the worst reference awarded a 1 and the best reference awarded a score equal to the total number of candidates.

Instructions for scoring ties on an order of merit list
In the event of an exact tie such as a contract bid, those candidates are awarded the same exact final score.   To determine that score first determine the location scores on the OML for all tied candidates.  Then divide the total of those tied location scores by number of tied individuals.  As an example:  if two candidates are have the submitted the highest bids at exactly the same cost then those two candidates are tied for the 1st and 2nd positions on the merit list.  The value of those positions is 1 and 2 points.  1 point + 2 points = 3 points.   3 points / two candidates = 1.5 points   Therefore these two tied candidates would be awarded 1.5 points each.
****!! To all prospective offerors, the attach document is the matrix on how the decision will be made for award. Please base your bid on the price for the number of sessions not per hour(s). 

The deadline for submission will not be extended!!!!
