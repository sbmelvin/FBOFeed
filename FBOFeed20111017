<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a purchase order to Gerstel Inc., 701 Digital Drive, Suite J, Linthicum, MD 21090 for the purchase of multipurpose samplers, CIS-4C inlets and CTS-2 cryotraps.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 4 months.</p>
<p>There are unique features of this Gerstel equipment that include the complete integration of the operating software (Maestro) into the GC-MS control software. This allows for the complete system to be operated using a single software system. Maestro also features a unique "Prep-ahead" function which allows for the overlap of sample preparation during sample analysis thereby increasing overall method throughput. Gerstel is the only manufacturer who offers the Dual Head Single Rail MPS with the prep, SPME and Headspace options. In addition, the Gerstel Dual Head Single Rail MPS includes a gas line which is necessary for headspace analysis (needed for current LRN-C methods) that is not present on other vendor instrumentation.</p>
<p>In addition to the features of the instrumentation, Gerstel has been the vendor for all of the GC-MS autosamplers throughout the Chemical Laboratory Response Network (LRN-C). In order to be consistent with these labs and allow for continuity in the program, the CDC needs to have the same instrumentation. The state public health laboratories use Gerstel MPS, CIS 4C and CTS-2 systems and they are familiar with the manufacturer's hardware and software. Gerstel is currently the manufacturer that has provided autosampler instrumentation to the state LRN-C laboratories. In order to have consistency across the network, we need to acquire the same make and model of instrumentation. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Gerstel Inc. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the maintenance to Vallerie Redd VIA E-MAIL ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 01195 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN August18, 2011. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
<p>VACCINE TECHNOLOGIES TO ADVANCE NEXT GENERATION ANTHRAX VACCINES <br />BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER NIAID-DMID-NIHAI2010104</p>
<p><br />Presolicitation Notice Information</p>
<p>Introduction<br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement to advance the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.<br />Description <br />The primary objective of this solicitation is to support the advanced development of candidate products which consist of a vaccine component and a technology that accelerates the immune response for use in post-event settings following the intentional release of the NIAID Category A Priority Pathogen B. anthracis or in response to naturally occurring outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by the NIAID Category A Priority Pathogen B. anthracis. In these settings, simplicity and efficiency of delivery of vaccine to, and the effectiveness in large numbers of patients are key considerations.</p>
<p>Candidate products that increase vaccine stability and/or reduce logistical requirements are important secondary objectives and would further enhance the capabilities of a candidate product that accelerates the immune response. Anticipated benefits may include: decreased manpower and time required to prepare and administer the vaccine, maximum compliance of the vaccine recipients, and production of a protective immune response with 1-2 doses of vaccine.</p>
<p><br />Vaccine components at the Product Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 (https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/Integrated_TRLs.aspx), which have demonstrated completion of current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing and undergone a Phase 1 clinical trial; TRL 5 in which advanced characterization of the vaccine component is demonstrated and cGMP process development is initiated; or TRL 4, in which the vaccine component is optimized and activity and efficiency are also demonstrated in a non-GLP setting may be proposed.</p>
<p>NOTE: When using these criteria, a vaccine component should be rated at a particular level only after all activities listed in that level have been completed (e.g., a product is rated at TRL 4 once it completes all of the activities listed in TRL 4).</p>
<p>Organizations responding to this Broad Agency Announcement should have documented expertise in product development, including regulatory submissions, to advance the development and evaluation of candidate products, against biological threats identified as the NIAID Category A and B Priority Pathogens (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/pages/cata.aspx&not;) or Top Priority Biological Threats in the HHS, 2007 PHEMCE Implementation Plan (https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/PHEMCE/enterprise/strategy/strategy.aspx).</p>
<p>Eligible candidate products include those for the NIAID Category A Priority Pathogen B. anthracis.</p>
<p>Additional technologies, when applicable, that increase vaccine stability and/or reduce logistical requirements, will be supported as components of the candidate product. Novel delivery platforms may be components of the candidate product to be developed. Cross-cutting platform delivery technologies applicable to more than one vaccine are also of interest. Candidate products include:</p>
<p>1. Vaccine Component - The vaccine component of a proposed candidate product should be at least at the TRL 4 in which the vaccine component is optimized and activity and efficiency are also demonstrated in a non-GLP setting.</p>
<p>2. Technology Component</p>
<p>a. The technology components used in the proposed candidate product may consist of a new adjuvant, an immune modulator, a formulation technology or a delivery platform designed to enhance the immune response onset for the NIAID Category A Priority Pathogen B. anthracis vaccine candidates. Simply changing a vaccine formulation, for example taking a liquid to a stable lyophilized vaccine formulation, would not be sufficient to meet the objectives.</p>
<p>b. Technology components should address reduced time to establish immunity with proof of concept efficacy data in animal models that demonstrate efficacy with the proposed vaccine- component and the feasibility of attaining a safety profile that meets all existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements.</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5 year period of performance beginning on or about September 27, 2012.</p>
<p>The NIAID estimates that one or more contracts may be issued for a total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) of up to $9.0 million per year. Importantly, contract activities will be divided into manageable time frames with initial funding of only the Base Period. Funding of subsequent timeframes will be funded by Options. Each Option will be fully funded when exercised and will be dependent on successful completion of critical predecessor activities, including USG acceptance of associated deliverables when applicable. The critical predecessor activities should constitute Go/No Go criteria for successor activities. The contract budget will be aligned with the Base Period, Options and associated tasks identified in the Product Development Plan and associated Gantt Chart.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed five years.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. This Broad Agency Announcement will be available electronically on/about September 26, 2011, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fbo.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a contract to Thales Australia Limited, Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Division, Thales Australia Level 2 Building 51, Garden Island, Australia 2011, on a sole-source basis for the acquisition of one (1) Australian Acoustic Generator (AAG) and two (2) Sweep Track Monitor Systems, (STMS4). The AAG is a water driven turbine powered acoustic generator that produces ship emulation and can be integrated with any sweep system. The STMS4 is designed for deployment with the AAG to provide positional tracking data and to facilitate control of both manned and unmanned operations.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.
  Both items being procured are exclusively manufactured by Thales Australia Limited.  The STMS4 was manufactured exclusively to interface with the AAG.   There are no distributors.  The AAG as well as the STMS4 are proprietary to ADI Limited.  NSWC PCD has successfully evaluated this equipment for use in the US Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Fleet having acquired the equipment under contract N61331-06-C-0030 and N61331-07-D-0006.  Use of alternate equipment will invalidate these tests.  Contracting with another company to design an alternate to this equipment would require extensive development funds that Thales Australia Limited has already expended and will not be cost effective for the US Navy.
  Additionally, numerous patent issues could require resolution.  In summary, the AAG and the STMS4 are only available from Thales Australia Limited.  Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL  32407. NAICS Code 334419. FSC 5845. Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The term "Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics" (AD&amp;P) refers generally to this application of automated monitoring, condition prognosis, and incipient failure detection. AD&amp;P includes applications to mechanical and electrical equipment. It also includes self testing of digital systems, including calibration verification for digital system (I/O) interfaces. Properly designed and implemented, AD&amp;P can clearly benefit the safe and reliable operation of a fuel cycle facility or nuclear power plant. But it is also possible for failure or incorrect operation of AD&amp;P resources to inhibit proper operation. In addition, the implementation of AD&amp;P involves the addition of equipment and software, and tends to make systems more complicated. Added complexity, unfortunately, brings with it an increased potential for hidden or unanticipated couplings and dependencies, and ultimately the possibility of an increased likelihood of failure. The tasks under this contract will provide technical guidance, regulatory-based acceptance criteria, and recommendations for tools and methodologies (T&amp;M) to support regulatory evaluation of proposed applications of AD&amp;P. These tasks also include assistance to NRC staff in preparing review processes and inspection procedures. The results of this work may result in improved NRC regulatory guidance on safety system network designs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

 This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or an obligation on the part of PM-TAS or RDECOM-ARDEC.   The purpose of this Sources Sought is to identify qualified vendors that have qualified battery designs that are capable of meeting the following requirements: 

 The battery shall be in compliance with Mil-PRF-32052 and MIL-PRF-32052/1 except as follows:
-	Electrical        o	Charge/Discharge Cycles: 2000 (minimum)        o	Capacity: 3.5AH        o	Charge Rate: 20-25A(minimum)
-	Environmental        o	Operating Temperature  30F to + 131 degrees F                 	Charging and Discharging
-	Physical        o	Weight: 4 lbs (max)
-	Schedule        o	Qty 10 Prototypes available in 120 days        o	Full Rate Production 365 days after prototype
-	Rough Order of Magnitude Per Unit Cost  Qty of 5300
 This battery design is being sought to support a power system for the Digitized M119A2 howitzer.  Approximately 603 Digitized M119A2 howitzers ( each howitzer requires 8 batteries) will be produced and spares will be required for the next 7 to 10 years.  In addition to lithium ion technology, information pertaining to all other battery technologies capable of meeting the above performance and schedule requirements should be submitted.  All submissions will need to verify safe operations of the proposed technology in all environments.  In addition, submissions of battery designs that are not fully compliant with all requirements are encouraged so that PM-TAS and RDECOM-ARDEC may assess the capabilities of all currently available battery technologies. 
 As a result of this Sources Sought a Request For Proposal (RFP) may be issued to develop a fully compliant battery. A full specification will be released if and when there is follow on procurement activity.

1. The preliminary and final deliverables and all associated working papers, application source code, and other material deemed relevant by the VA which have been generated by the contractor in the performance of this task order are the exclusive property of the U.S. Government and shall be submitted to the CO at the conclusion of the task order.
2.	The CO will be the sole authorized official to release verbally or in writing, any data, the draft deliverables, the final deliverables, or any other written or printed materials pertaining to this task order. No information shall be released by the contractor. Any request for information relating to this task order presented to the contractor shall be submitted to the CO for response.
3.	Press releases, marketing material or any other printed or electronic documentation related to this project, shall not be publicized without the written approval of the CO.
Q.	Earned Value Management System - NIA
1.	An Earned Value Management System (EVMS) is required for major acquisitions for development, in accordance with OMB Circular A-11. The Government may also require an EVMS for other acquisitions, in accordance with agency policy contained in VA Directive 6061. Contractors that are required to have their own EVMS shall follow procedures contained in the VA EVMS Application Guide.
2.	The following paragraphs reflect EVMS requirements and may be modified as necessary for selected use.
a. Contractor Independent Deliverables. This contract requires the contractor to operate as a distinct entity to produce a deliverable(s). The contractor is required to have its own compliant EVMS, per VA Directive 6061, Table B-1, and provide EVM reports to the VA.
(1).	Non-Compliant EVMS. If the offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with the American National Standards Institute /Electronics Industries Alliance (ANSI/EIA) Standard-748, Earned Value Management Systems, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan for compliance with these EVMS standards. Offerors shall not be eliminated from consideration for contract award because they do not have an EVMS that complies with these standards.
(2).	EVMS Reports. As a minimum, contracting officers shall require contractors to submit EVMS monthly reports for those contracts for which an EVMS applies.
(3).	Subcontractors. EVMS requirements will be applied to subcontractors using the same rules as applied to the prime contractor. VA will decide the flow down of the EVM requirement to subcontractors. In all cases, the prime contractor is responsible for reporting EVM data.
(4).	EVMS Plan. When an offeror is required to provide an EVMS plan as parfi of its proposal, the contracting officer will determine the adequacy of the proposed EVMS plan prior to contract award.
(5).	Performance Measurement Baseline. Contractors are required to resource load schedules in order to set a performance measurement baseline. Resources do not have to be specifically named.
(6).	Program Management Reviews. The Contractor shall conduct Program Management Review (PMR) meetings at mutually agreed upon dates and locations. During these reviews, the contractor shall present integrated cost, schedule, and technical performance status. Government Integrated Product Team (IPT) leads or functional managers shall include cost information in discussions of schedule status, technical performance,
 
and risk using earned value as an integrating tool. The following shall be addressed: Costlschedule trends, significant costlschedule/technical variances, projected impacts, quantified risk assessments, and corrective action plans.
(7).	Contractor Earned Value Management. The Cost Performance Report Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81466A), and Integrated Master Schedule Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81650) shall be developed, maintained, updated/statused and reported on a monthly basis per deliverable requirements, respectively. The contractor shall establish, maintain, and use in the performance of this contract, an integrated management system compliant with the Industry Guidelines for Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS) ANSI/EIA-748 as determined by the Government.
An EVMS that has been formally validated and accepted by the cognizant contracting officer is required for all (fixed price, cost, or incentive) contracts, subcontracts, and other agreements valued at or greater than $50 million in then-year dollars. The application of these concepts shall provide for early indicators of contract cost and schedule problems.
For contracts valued at or greater than $20 million but less than $50 million then-year dollars, the following statement applies: The contractor is required to have an Earned Value Management System that complies with ANSI/EIA-748; however, the government will not formally validate/accept the contractor's management system (no formal review). The contractor will submit an EVMS description and proof of prior certification with its bid.
(8).	Integrated Baseline Review (IBR). The contractor shall review its performance measurement baseline plan with the Government within six months of contract award or initiation of an Undefinitized Contract Action, and subsequently, when required, following major changes to the baseline. The Government will verify during the IBR, and follow-on 1BRs when required that the contractor has established and maintains a reliable performance measurement baseline. The contractor will ensure that the baseline includes the entire contract technical scope of work consistent with contract schedule requirements, and has adequate resources assigned. The contractor will assure the Government that effective earned value methodologies are used to accurately measure work accomplished and determine contract cost, schedule, and technical performance. The IBR will be used to achieve a mutual understanding of the baseline plan, cost and schedule risk, and the underlying management processes used for planning and controlling the project.
(9).	Subcontract Cost/Schedule Management and Reporting. Subcontracts exceeding $20M in then-year dollars will apply the requirements of the Integrated Master Schedule Description (VA-DIMGMT-81650) and the Cost Performance Report Description (VA-DIMGMT-81466). For contracts valued at or greater than $20 million but less than $50 million, the following statement applies: The contractor is required to have an Earned Value Management System that complies with ANSI/EIA-748; howeyer, the Government will not formally validate/accept the contractor's management system (no formal review). EVMS flow down to contracts of less than $20M in then-year dollars or Firm Fixed Price contracts that exceed 12 months duration is a risk-based decision and will be as mutually agreed between the contractor and the Government.
(10).	Contract Work Breakdown Structure (CWBS)_ The contractor shall develop and maintain the CWBS and CWBS dictionary.
(11).	over Target Baseline (OTB)/Restructure. The contractor may conclude the baseline no longer represents a realistic plan in terms of budgetlschedule execution. In the event the contractor determines an OTB/Restructuring action is necessary, the contractor must obtain Government approval prior to implementing an OTB/Restructuring action. The request should also include detailed implementation procedures as well as an implementation timeframe. The contractor will not implement the OTB/Restructuring prior to receiving written approval from the Contracting Officer.
(12).	Award Fee Criteria. For contracts that include an award fee, the contractor will demonstrate the use of Earned Value Management (EVM) as a tool for cost and schedule control and as a basis for communicating with the Government. The Government will determine the eligibility for of and amount of any award fee granted. In addition to demonstrating the use of EVM award fee criteria for the contractor will include the following:
(a).	Maintain timely detail planning as far in advance as practical;
(b).	Ensure the system provides' accurate costlschedule performance status, reliable and timely cost/schedule projections, and quantified risk assessments;
(c).	Provide clear and comprehensive explanations of performance problems and associated impacts, and establish and carry out effective recovery plans;
(d).	Control and minimize changes to the baseline particularly in the near term;
 
(e).	Ensure all subcontractor-authorized effort is detail planned into measurable objective work packages to the extent possible;
(f).	Provide program-level Estimate at Completion (EAC) assessments that include consideration of potential risks and cost containment plans; and

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 
Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB) 2012-1 Camp Lejeune, North Carolina 

INTRODUCTION:

This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the USMC Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB) Team consisting of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, Expeditionary Energy Office, Marine Corps Systems Command, Marine Corps Training and Education Command and the Office of Naval Research will take a procurement action in this matter.  Neither the ExFOB Team nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.

The USMC ExFOB Team is interested in gathering information to further its understanding of currently available technologies that could enhance the logistics sustainability of  remote Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) engaged in combat operations.
  Specific areas of interest for this RFI include: (1) Wearable Electric Power Conversion and Distribution Systems; and (2) Lightweight, Man-portable, Water Purification Systems for Individual/Fire Team/Platoon Level Internal Resupply.  Technologies of interest are those that would most rapidly and effectively enhance the self-sufficiency of forward deployed, individual Marines operating from a FOB or naval shipping.  Information is requested in the form of a brief technology description, working photographs of technology (no drawings), inclusion of any government reports, tests, demonstrations and/or any currently existing government contractual relationship.

GENERAL BACKGROUND:

Since March 2010, the Marine Corps has held an annual ExFOB event as a venue for industry to demonstrate their latest expeditionary energy capabilities.
  The primary focus at these demonstrations is to observe and evaluate industry solutions that will enhance the Marine Corps self-sufficiency, reduce the energy demand of platforms and systems, and lightening the load of the Marine Corps in current and future expeditionary operations.  Over the last two years the ExFOB Team has accelerated concepts-to-combat to reduce the Warfighter need for fuel, water and battery logistics.  ExFOB has guided the development of new requirements and has informed Marine Corps investment and acquisition decisions.

ExFOB 2012-1 will occur in the first half of the calendar year on Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune.  The intent for ExFOB 2012-1 is to seek solutions supporting the individual Marine/small unit power and water needs specifically focusing on solutions enhancing the combat effectiveness of the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) at sea and when employed ashore.

Information received in response to this RFI is intended to serve two purposes: (1)  Technology descriptions will help formulate requirements development to increase the combat effectiveness of the Marine Corps; and (2) Technology descriptions may result in invitations for equipment manufacturers to demonstrate their technologies at the ExFOB 2012-1 at no cost or risk to the Government,  if the manufacturer can prove their product or prototype would be sufficiently developed for a conceptual demonstration by 14 April 2012.
   This ExFOB demonstration will be conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Armys Enterprise Market Investigation Process (EMIP). (http://www.peocscss.army.mil/EMIP.html)

The ExFOB 2012-1 demonstration period will take place between 30 April and 04 May 2012 aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  A three day window on either side of the demonstration will be used for vendor setup and retrograde.  Vendors invited to demonstrate their technology will be referred to as participants and will be contacted via email with a signed letter of invitation NLT 1 Feb.  After this date the Marine Corps will actively engage all participants to determine operations/logistics, data collection plan and retrograde.
  The actual ExFOB 2012-1 data collection will take place over five days from 0800 to 1600.  Participants will be responsible for all containment measures and all water will be demonstrated in a closed loop system.  All measures will be taken by the Marine Corps to insure base safety, security and compliance are upheld throughout ExFOB 2012-1.  At NO TIME are goodie bags, gifts or alcohol allowed on the ExFOB premise.  Participants at the ExFOB can, and will, be asked to leave if they are found to be in violation of the above or acting in an unsafe manner at anytime. 


SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST:

Wearable Electric Power Systems 
As the variety of energy consuming devices and batteries in the Marine Corps inventory continues to expand, power source compatibility is becoming a growing concern.
  The increasing requirement for individual Marines to embark on missions carrying redundant energy in the form of multiple incompatible battery types translates into excessive battery weight and a logistical burden on the individual and the force.  The use of wearable, weight-efficient centralized or de-centralized power systems is currently frustrated by the differing electric power requirements of, and interfaces to, hand-carried devices.  An additional complexity arises from the need to distribute electrical power to various hand-carried devices through electrical conductors and dirt resistant, mechanically robust electrical connectors.  Finally, the inability to efficiently harvest and store energy on individuals while both on the move and stationary for varying amounts of time limits the ability to reduce the battery combat load and to extend the power endurance of individuals.
  Information is requested on lightweight, man-wearable expeditionary solutions that form, or contribute to, a system of systems approach that may include one or more of several components: energy harvesting; efficient, high density, energy storage; electric power conversion and distribution; and, power demand reduction solutions for man-portable energy consuming devices.

Lightweight, Man-portable, Water Purification Systems for Individual/Fire Team/Platoon Level Internal Resupply 
The Marine Corps relies on filtration followed by reverse osmosis for purifying large quantities of bulk water from either fresh or salt-water sources.  Microbial sanitation of purified bulk water is maintained via chlorination.
  Water purification at the level of the individual Marine is handled differently.  Currently, the USMC utilizes the MIOX pen and MSR In-Line filter for individual level water purification.  Purification tablets are also included in the Individual First Aid Kit.  As technology has advanced since these items were initially fielded, the USMC is seeking the next generation water purification solution.  The system or technology should be scalable and lightweight using the P248 standards for fresh water.  The system or technology would allow for scalability from the individual to the platoon level.  In addition, simplicity and durability are critical features of a next generation solution.  Power sources should be limited, if possible.
  If affected by the freezing and thawing process, the potential issues should be addressed.    

SUBMISSION PROCESS AND DUE DATE:

Sources capable of fully satisfying these requirements should access the EMIP website below and submit a Technology Application Idea (TAI) submission form as per the directions on the EMIP website.   The ExFOB team is partnered with the Armys EMIP.  The due date for all submissions is midnight on 16 Dec 2011. Additional information regarding the joint Army/USMC review process and ExFOB 2012-1 industry demonstration shall be provided to those who submit TAIs at: http://www.peocscss.army.mil/EMIP.html

<DESC><p>Synopsis: <br />THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A SOLICITATION. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this Special Notice; all costs associated with responding to this Special Notice will be solely at the interested party's expense.</p>
<p>Description: The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to conduct a workshop to present a new program for the Autonomous Aerial Cargo / Utility Vehicle (AACUS) Innovative Naval Prototype. Industry participation in this workshop is encouraged in order to promote discussion of relevant current state-of-the art technologies, potential technical and sociotechnical gaps, and Broad Agency Announcement teaming possibilities.</p>
<p>The primary focus of AACUS is to develop advanced autonomous capabilities to enable unmanned and optionally manned VTOL air systems to be fully capable of providing affordable and reliable rapid response cargo delivery to distributed small units in demanding conditions. AACUS will lead the way in developing and implementing VTOL-based obstacle detection and avoidance and autonomous landing site selection and dynamic execution capabilities for unprepared landing sites, with goal-based supervisory control by any field personnel with no special training. These capabilities, expected to form part of an open architecture framework in order to be used across different VTOL platforms, should have sufficient reliability to be entrusted with precision cargo delivery and evacuating human casualties from remote sites.</p>
<p>The purpose of the workshop is to provide an overview of AACUS for FY12-FY17 including expected milestones, deliverables, demonstrations, and approximate funding levels. A preliminary concept of operations (CONOPS) will be posted to the ONR website in advance of the workshop. Participants from a cross-section of industry, government laboratories, FFRDCs, and academia are encouraged to attend. However, all workshop participants will be expected to present, in an open setting, their areas of expertise that they see contributing to the AACUS program. These presentations will take the form of 5-10 minute presentations and/or poster presentations depending on the interest level.</p>
<p>The workshop will be held at the Crowne Plaza Washington National Airport, 1480 Crystal Dr.<br />Arlington, VA 22202, 703-416-1600, www.cpnationalairport.com, on 1-2 November 2011. Check-in will begin at 7:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time and the meeting will begin at 8:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time both days. The meeting will conclude each day at 4:30 PM. There will be a no-host networking reception on the 1 of November, venue to be announced at a later date. Details concerning registration to attend this event are available at the following website: http://www.onr.navy.mil.</p>
<p>Pre-registration for the ONR AACUS Industry Workshop is required. Walk-ins will not be permitted. Registration is limited to two (2) representatives from each organization attending the Industry Workshop. However if requested attendance exceeds the capacity of the conference room, it may be necessary to further limit attendance of personnel from each organization to just one (1). ONR will reply via e-mail with the registration confirmation. All expenses associated with attendance will be the responsibility of the participant(s). Registration by telephone will not be accepted. Security clearances are not required and all discussions will be unclassified. The deadline for submitting registration requests is 28 OCT 2011 at 4:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time.</p>
<p>Parties interested in submitting proposals in response to any future solicitation regarding the subject of this workshop are advised that they must be in compliance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) at the time of proposal submission.</p>
<p>Questions/comments related to the AACUS INP Workshop will be accepted via e-mail until 27 October 2011. Submit questions/comments to the following e-mail address: Angelo Collins, collinsa@centratechnology.com. Questions/comments shall be reviewed and addressed at the workshop.</p>
<p>Related questions/comments submitted after the AACUS INP Workshop will be accepted via Angelo Collins (collinsa@centratechnology.com) from the date of workshop conclusion on 2 November 2011 until 23 November 2011. This limited time frame for questions/comments is to allow for potential feedback to be incorporated into any resulting BAA /solicitation. Responses to written questions and comments both before and after the workshop will be posted on the ONR website.</p>

<DESC>PROJECT/EQUIPMENT:<br>Illinois Waterway, Lockport Lock, Positioning System Upgrade<br><br>AUTHORITY:<br>10 U.S.C.   2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br><br>1.  CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  US Army Corps of Engineer, Rock Island District, P.O. Box 2004, Clock Tower Building, Rock Island, IL  61204-2004.<br><br>2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  Sole Source Service and Supply Contract with Rockwell Automation for the Positioning System Upgrade, Illinois Waterway, Lockport, IL. <br><br>3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  Replacement of existing rotating cam limit switches on the lower gate machinery with new resolvers, associated I/O, conduit, cabling, and programming updates as necessary to upgrade positioning system. <br><br>4.  AUTHORITY CITIED:  10 U.S.C.   2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br><br>5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  The existing PLC-based navigation control system for the lock facility is an existing Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley ControlLogix system. <br>* The hardware to be installed into existing Allen-Bradley equipment is proprietary required to be manufactured by Rockwell Automation or be compatible with Allen-Bradley equipment as provided by Partners of Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley as indentified above.<br>* Rockwell Automation replaced the PLC-3 processor in calendar year 2004 to upgrade equipment to a ControlLogix L5 PLC and provide software and programming changes upgrading to be compatible with a ControlLogix L5 PLC.  This upgraded the PLC control platform to a state-of-the art system, ControlLogix, and it modified the navigation control system to include resolvers on the upstream lift gates and changed the existing I/O modules and programming for the new resolvers to include graphical interfaces.<br>* A PLC software programmer with demonstrable experience with the controls and operations of the existing navigation lock control system and having demonstrable experience in the last 5 years with Allen-Bradley ControlLogix L5 PLC-based system with a ControlLogix platform that dates back to calendar 2004 is required to ensure that risk of equipment failure is minimized and that there are no unauthorized interruptions to navigation traffic.  Any changes made to the Lockport Lock navigation lock control system are required to be made between tow boat lockages and otherwise made within twelve hour shutdown for which the Government has authorization to close the lock to navigation (i.e. navigation lock chamber shut down).<br>* Rockwell Automation successfully complied with 2 hour shut down requirements in a 2004 upgrade contract.<br>* Government personnel do not have the technical knowledge of the ControlLogix PLC and existing navigation control program necessary to prevent programming changes that could shut the lock down for an extended period of time. <br>* New AMCI 1761 Expansion Interface Cards built for Allen-Bradley 1756 I/O racks and Rockwell Automation Allen- Bradley 1771-ASB series D cards are required for the two new resolvers to communicate with the existing Allen-Bradley ControlLogix PLC control system, and for the Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley Model 1756 I/O racks to be able to communicate correctly with the existing Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley ControlLogix PLC.<br>* Other manufacturer's I/O hardware is not compatible with the existing Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley ControlLogix PLC system and its I/O racks.<br><br>6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  In accordance with Regional PARC Memorandum (RPM) 09-03 Posting of Sole Source Award Notices, a notice of intent to award a sole source must be transmitted/posted to the GPE for a total of 15 days, before the actual sole source award can be executed (not including commercial requirements which can be posted for less than 15 days).  A Notice of Intent to Sole Source was posted to ASFI/FEDBizOpps on 01 June 11 and requests for capability statements were due by 2:00pm CDT on 15 June 11.  No firms submitted a capability statement and supporting documentation by the response date of 15 June 11.  Based on the information in paragraph five above, competition for this action is not appropriate.<br><br>7.  ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  As service requirements similar to this one come up in the future, all existing service providers will be considered and if more than one is capable of providing the required service, open competition for the project will occur.<br><br>8.  MARKET SURVEY:  Based on this project requirements attempts to use other vendors will result in a substantial costs to the Government related to the new vendor producing equipment that is compatible with the existing PLC-based navigation control system.<br><br>9.  INTERESTED SOURCES:  To date, no other sources have written to express an interest in this procurement by submitting a capability statement and supporting documentation by the response date of 15 June 11.   <br><br>10.  OTHER FACTS:  None applicable to this procurement action.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source firm fixed-price type contract to IHS-Global Insight, Incorporated. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is involved in collecting and maintaining critical navigation information for the general benefit of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers District offices for study applications and decision-making support.  The total work effort described here will add to that inventory of strategic navigation information by providing quick accessible information on current and projected traffic flows between individual U.S. ports and harbors and international countries of origination or destination.  Future traffic flows will be forecasted to provide planning information and support the Corps' civil works program evaluation.  The capability to evaluate deep-draft waterborne trade flows at the port level, both from the perspective of historical, present, and the foreseeable future is often required for the execution of detailed project evaluations for new waterway improvements as well as evaluation of the programs for ongoing maintenance and operation (O&M) of current or existing projects.   The requirement to sole source is due to the fact that prior work has been completed in developing an information framework that compiles information on historical, current, and foreseeable traffic flows by commodity and vessel type(s) between U.S. ports and foreign countries or trade partners.  This information framework is part of the World Trade Service (WTS), a proprietary commercial product available from IHS Global Insight.  This service is a forecast of trade by commodity, general vessel type and volume for U.S. coastal regions or reaches (i.e., North Atlantic, South Atlantic, etc.) over a 20-year forecast horizon.  <br><br>The purpose of this continued effort is to develop a second generation information framework (tentatively identified as the U.S. Port Trade Navigator) incorporating considerably more detail for cargo and waterborne traffic projections and respective trade flows that can be cross-tabulated or stratified by vessel type and vessel characteristics.  The required Firm-Fixed-Price contract will provide for IHS Global Insight to modify their "Trade Navigator" software to allow for the disaggregation of WTS regional coastal forecasts to the individual port level.  IHS Global Insight will also disaggregate the vessel fleet associated with these port-level trade forecasts into discrete vessel categories according to service, size, and capacity stratifications that will allow Corps planners and economists to determine channel depth requirements for vessels forecasted to call at individual U.S. coastal deep draft harbors.<br><br>USACE is requesting two general deliverable products with the first, Product I, to be considered a requirement, and the second, Product II, to be proposed as an option for acquisition by the Government.  The first product primarily constitutes a one-time extraction or "dump" of data and statistics of the WTS system with disaggregation of corresponding tonnage forecasts according to year, U.S. port, origin/destination, commodity (where available) and general mode of waterborne transport (i.e., containerized versus bulk, etc.) for a specified number of ports of interest.  The second product involves providing the same capability with enhancements to include estimation or forecast of supporting fleet service frequency according to carrier type, deadweight ton (DWT) class, and summer load-line draft (SLLD) class within a computerized system directly accessible by USACE personnel.  These items are generally described as follows:  <br>a.	Product I:  Complete analyses and work at the level of effort executable with the existing WTS system for the top 24 U.S. ports as prioritized by HQUSACE and deliver the results in an Excel workbook, Access database, or Oracle database.<br>b.	Product II:  Further develop the Trade Navigator as a system directly accessible via the internet by Corps personnel to support analysis of any U.S. Coastal deep-draft port (as needed) for which the Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) compiles data, with a capability and option for continued annual maintenance to support ongoing USACE access and usage. <br><br>This contract will include allowances for Option Years 1 through 4.  Each Option Year provides for continued maintenance of the Trade Navigator software module developed in the Base Year, and continued access by USACE economists and planners to this tool in conjunction with IHS Global Insight's WTS forecast subscription service.<br>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract to IHS Global Insight, Inc. for these services.   These services will be provided to the US Army Corps of Engineers, Institute of Water Resources, Alexandria, VA.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Nancy Hilleary at Nancy.L.Hilleary@usace.army.mil, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22315.<br>

<DESC>In support of the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) Product Office (JPO), the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) has a requirement for a Risk Reduction Program (RRP) to build upon the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Technical Data Package (TDP) and Manufacturing Data Package (MDP), developed by Raytheon Company under Contract DASG60-98-C-0001, to provide a more affordable product, with reduced manufacturing cycle times, a mature supplier and subcontractor base, and a minimum number of obsolete components.  These provisions are intended to minimize the risks the SDD product currently presents to the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production programs and ensure material procurement and manufacturing can meet critical planned JLENS LRIP schedule milestones with minimum technical, cost, and schedule risk. The USASMDC/ARSTRAT intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Raytheon Company, Andover, Massachusetts, to fulfill this requirement.  The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  Award to any source other than Raytheon Company would result in unacceptable delays and substantial costs.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Dianne Trimble at dianne.trimble@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source action is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit a response which will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.<br><br>

<DESC>The Program Manager for Training Systems for the U.S. Marine Corps intends to award a five year Indefinite Quantities Contract (IQC) on a sole source basis to Bohemia Interactive Simulations Inc., 3050 Technology Parkway, Suite 110, Orlando, FL, 32826 for Virtual Battle Space 2 (VBS2) Software Development and Software Maintenance for the Deployable Virtual Training Environment (DVTE) system.  The IQC ceiling value is $10.5M. 

The proposed contract action is to procure USMC specific software development efforts for VBS2 and to procure Software Maintenance for the current VBS2 software delivered by Bohemia and utilized on DVTE training systems that are resident throughout the Marine Corps. Anticipated VBS2 development efforts include Artificial Intelligence - Reaction/Detection, Enhanced Terrain/Structure Degradation, AAR Enhancements, VBS2 FIRES/STRIKE Phase II, Degraded Communications, Customizable Life Form/Animations, DOD 2025 Symbology and Training Event Logistics Data Collection.
 

The Marine Corps has an enterprise license for the unlimited distribution of the compiled executable VBS2 files for Marine Corps purposes but has no distribution rights to the source code. As the developer and proprietary owner of the gaming engine and software, Bohemia is the only entity that can license the use of VBS2 and therefore VBS2 cannot be leveraged or modified by other contractors to support the Marine Corps requirements.  It is the Government's belief that only one source is capable to meet the requirements, and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement. 

All questions, concerns, and information should be addressed to Fred Boehne at fred.j.boehne@usmc.mil or mailed to Fred Boehne at the contracting office address listed below.
 No phone calls will be accepted. 

Contracting Office Address: 
M67854 MARINE CORPS SYSTEMS COMMAND/PM TRASYS

<CONTACT>David Stemple, Phone 2699615372, Email david.stemple@dla.mil
<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency has a requirement for Honeywell 4800isr handheld barcode readers. This is issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) # SP4707-12-Q-0006. Place of performance, inspection, acceptance and F.O.B. are at Destination, Battle Creek, Michigan. Delivery shall be no later than 30 calendar days after award date.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2005-53.</p>
<p>This acquisition is set-aside 100 percent for small business concerns, and the associated NAICS code is 334119 with a SBA size standard of 1000 in employment.<br /><br />Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote. Quotes with quantities of less than requested or products other than those requested specifically by brand name will be deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>CLIN Descriptions:</p>
<p>CLIN 001: Honeywell 4800Isr Handheld Barcode Scanner Kits with MH10 Conversion Formats Defaulted, 12 foot USB cable and 5 year standard warranty. P/N: 4800ISR051C-0F00E, QTY: 310 ea.</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification Documentation: The Honeywell hardware is compatible with DAISY and will be used with RBI. The handhelds have been tested with DSS and are currently being used at the DDCs to support DSS, which will be used with RBI. The DSS System is configured to work with these scanners specifically. It is not possible to reconfigure DSS to use a different brand of scanner. Deviating from this brand would create support issues and possibly delay shipments. Only the Honeywell 4800 will ensure compatibility and interoperability with DSS. This compatibility will ensure interoperability between employees using DAISY and DSS, and in the future, RBI Solution. The devices can utilize the existing IT infrastructure at depots which are co-located with DRMS and will ensure the greatest hardware and software compatibility with the currently fielded baseline. This hardware and software combination will enable extensive interoperability among DLA resources.</p>
<p>Only new equipment is being solicited. Remanufactured or refurbished equipment, as defined in FAR 11.001, is technically unacceptable. Trade-in or exchange of old equipment is not available.</p>
<p>The evaluation factor(s) for award is; lowest-price, technically acceptable. Any resulting contract or order will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>Please place "SP4707-12-Q-0006" in the subject field of any e-mail correspondence. Questions regarding this RFQ are due by 10/21/2011 at 4:00 p.m. EST. Questions submitted after this deadline shall not be answered. Quotes are due by the response deadline, 10/25/2011 at 4:00 p.m. EST. Late quotes shall not be considered for award. Please include your Cage Code with your quote.

The term "unit price" excludes any part of the price directly resulting from requirements for preservation, packaging, or packing beyond standard commercial practice.

<p>(1) Is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and</p>
<p>(2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established price.

<p>(ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request.</p>
<p>(3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Procurement Section (PS) would like to provide a structured Professional Development Program (PDP) consistent with continuous learning needs for their procurement professionals to enhance their awareness, knowledge, competencies, and capabilities through learning and experience by using, capturing, and sharing knowledge to the overall benefit of the FBI's mission requirements. The overall objective is to create an evolutionary-future environment where employees are engaged and encouraged to take a leadership role in identifying and solving problems that benefit the procurement workforce, the customer and the FBI's mission needs.
<p>In order to create this environment the FBI PS believes that contracting professionals must not only have technical competence and broad contracting experience; but they must also demonstrate: <br />- Leader Competence<br />- Business Acumen<br />- Networking and Interpersonal Skills<br />- Customer Relationship Skills<br />- Embracing Accountability<br />- Listening Skills <br />- Coaching and Change Management Skills<br />- Communications Skills<br />- Sense of Community - with all players in the Acquisition Process<br />- Mutual Valuing</p>
<p>These values should be reflected in the PDP through all of the courses taught so that the contracting professional may hone their abilities as a competent and successful business professional, FBI mission partner and leader. The courses should be specifically tailored to provide skill set advancement for all contracting professionals in varying experience levels and background.</p>
<p>Tier 1: Entry-Level<br />The FBI PS has identified three tiers in which these courses should be grouped. The First Tier (Tier 1) will provide the path for contracting professionals who are in the beginner to novice phase of their profession. These entry level courses, taught to GS 7-11 contracting professionals, will reflect the values listed above, and provide a leadership foundation that the CO and CS will take with them throughout their career. Themes should be focused on what and why more than how.</p>
<p>Tier 2: Mid-Level<br />The Second Tier (Tier 2) will provide the skills needed for those contracting professionals who are beginning to come into their own as FBI leaders. These courses will be taught to GS 12-14 contracting professionals, and will reflect the values above, with an emphasis on mission value. The courses in this tier should provide the contracting professional with not only what and why, but the how, and provide these professionals the ability to take ownership of their skills. The courses should also reflect a participant input into learning about and developing their own leadership style. The Tier 2 professional should be approached in a manner consistent with their previous experience, with a lens towards the future challenges of becoming a true leader within the FBI.</p>
<p>Tier 3: Senior Level<br />The Third Tier (Tier 3) training will provide awareness for the experienced contracting professionals, who have been in a leadership role for some years, to shape those leaders coming in and provide the skills necessary to provide daily guidance to future leaders. Tier 3 contracting professionals will be GS-15 professionals who have provided the government with years of service in either a leadership or professional role. The courses in this tier should provide the contracting professional with the ability to pass on their skills, and foster an environment in which budding contracting professionals are encouraged to take ownership of their responsibilities and provide opportunities for the leaders of the future to develop and move into future roles. Themes should have a high-level focus, with a view towards the future of FBI contracting and creating an environment and legacy of success.<br /><br />Please Send all Questions</p>

Fingerprints must also be taken as part of the pre-employment process and must be completed before the physician/PA is allowed to work. The fingerprint check should be coordinated with the Administrative Officer. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. All IHS regulations and policies applicable to these Acts shall be enforced. The Contractor shall comply with IHS facility infection control and safety procedures, practices, and standards.

Performance Work Statement (PWS) Total Asset Visibility (TAV) Suite of Applications Help Desk Support Services

1.0 Introduction:  The NAVSUP Business Systems Center, formerly known as NAVSISA, is the Information Technology (IT) support provider for NAVSUP.  NAVSUP Business Systems Center requires continuing NetWeave interface software support that underpins the connectivity for the remaining Total Asset Visibility (TAV) applications; Centralized Point of Entry Network/Virtual Master Stock Item Record (CPEN/VMSIR), Naval Aviation Logistics Command/Management Information System (NALCOMIS) and Force Inventory Management Analysis Reporting System (FIMARS).
  

2.0 Background:  The Navy established a goal of attaining visibility and accessibility of all unclassified assets held by all claimants in accordance with mutually agreed upon set of business rules.  TAV increases lateral redistribution of assets, increases efficient use of assets, decreases procurement and repair investment costs, reduces duplication of inventory, performs better planning and more informed decisions.  The primary application, Real-time Reutilization Asset Management (RRAM) migrated to Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in July 2011.  Continued communications between CPEN/VMSIR, NALCOMIS, FIMARS and the end users, remains an ongoing requirement, and as such NAVSUP Business Systems Center will continue to utilize broad-based middleware GOTS-COTS interface software.
  NetWeave allows the users to interconnect their otherwise incompatible legacy computer systems and open them up to modern technologies of workstations, LANs, and SQL servers.  This software was designed specifically to support the high performance, scalability, reliability, and data integrity needs of mission-critical, distributed applications.  The vendor supported middleware serves as the glue, which binds diverse computer systems that were not designed to communicate with each other into a seamless application network.

10.0 Security:

SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Access to Federally Controlled Facilities and/or Unclassified Sensitive Information or Unclassified IT Systems (May 2010) 

Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006  DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive  12 (HSPD-12) dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12.
  This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.  This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform certain unclassified both non-sensitive and sensitive duties.  It is the responsibility of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.  
  
The requirement to control access to sensitive information applies to all US government IT systems and/or areas where unclassified but sensitive information may be discussed, displayed or maintained.  DON policy prescribes that all unclassified data that has not been approved for public release and is stored on mobile computing devises must be treated as sensitive data and encrypted using commercially available encryption technology.
 Whenever granted access to sensitive information, contractor employees shall follow applicable DoD/DoN instructions, regulations, policies and procedures when reviewing, processing, producing, protecting, destroying and/or storing that information.  Operational Security (OPSEC) procedures and practices must be implemented by both the contractor and contract employee to protect the product, information, services, operations and missions related to the contract. The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractors Security Representative.  Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the Navy Commands Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractors Security Representative.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter.  The Contractors Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer.  

Sensitive Positions 
Contractor employee whose duties require accessing a DoD unclassified computer/network, working with sensitive unclassified information (either at a Government or contractor facility), or physical access to a DoD facility must be a US citizen and possess a favorable trustworthiness determination prior to installation access.  To obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination, each contractor employee must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC) which consists of a NACI including a FBI fingerprint check plus credit and law enforcement checks.
 Each contractor employee applying for a trustworthiness determination is required to complete:

	SF-85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions
	Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards
	Original Signed Release Statements 

Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.  To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access a DoD unclassified computer/network, and/or have access to sensitive unclassified information, the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period.

IT Systems Access
When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employees duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Commands Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individuals performance under the contract.
  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.  The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Commands Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date. 
     
When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractors Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.
  

Security Approval Process
The Contractors Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Commands Security Manager.  The Contractors Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Commands Security Manager.  Forms and fingerprint cards may be obtained from the Navy Commands Security Manager.  These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employees anticipated date for reporting for duty.
  The Navy Commands Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy Commands Security Manager may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment.  A favorable review of the questionnaire and advance fingerprint results are required as an interim measure prior to the contract employee start date.  An unfavorable determination made by the Navy Commands Security Manager is final and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract.

If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Commands Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).
  The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR.  The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employees performance under the contract. 

The Navy Commands Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing.  Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a position of trust determination.  When a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees shall not be permitted to work on this contract effort and if already working on the contract shall be removed immediately.  

The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of access for a proposed contractor employee who fails to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.
  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees for working in non-sensitive positions, with sensitive information, and/or on Government IT systems.  The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information.

<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers, in descending order of importance: Technical ability to meet specifications, price, and delivery.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></p>

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. <br />Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />VP Signaling Telecommunication and Electricity<br />PT KERETA API INDONESIA (PERSERO)<br />Jl. Perintis Kemerdekaan No. 1<br />Bandung, 40117, Indonesia<br />Tel: +62-22-4230031<br />Fax: +62-22-4203342</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to PT Kereta Api Indonesia that will assist PT KAI<br />in evaluating the development of rail signaling and telecommunications systems in Indonesia.</p>
<p>1. Development of a strategic plan with regards to PT KAI's rail signaling and telecommunications systems programs; <br />2. Provide specific system recommendations with regards to potential rail signaling and telecommunications systems improvements and acquisitions.</p>
<p>PT Kereta Api Indonesia (PT KAI), Indonesia's state-owned rail operator, manages a network consisting of four unconnected rail systems on two of Indonesia's major islands, Java and Sumatra. Its current signaling system consists of both electronic and mechanical signaling and train control systems, much of which relies on outdated technology dating to its initial construction. For example, there are several main lines which utilize mechanical semaphore signals, which railways throughout the world abandoned decades ago because of cost, reliability and safety concerns. In certain areas, PT KAI has deployed relatively modern automatic block signals which make use of fiber optic communications (much of this equipment having been deployed under bilateral assistance packages, primarily from France, Spain, and the Netherlands). As a result the network now contains several different signaling systems of different age, manufacturer and reliability. The diversity of the current system translates into high maintenance costs and has also played a role in several serious accidents in recent years.</p>
<p>If passenger traffic were to continue to follow prevailing trends, PT KAI would be carrying about 324 million passengers and over 26 million tons of freight by 2025. PT KAI projects that daily passengers are set to increase from 500,000-600,000 today to some 1.5 million passengers by 2014 and that maintaining rail safety and efficiency will be critical. In order to accommodate this growth, PT KAI will need to expand its network and make significant infrastructure investments, including new signaling systems, in order to increase efficiency. In order to accommodate higher train speeds and additional freight and passenger traffic, it will be necessary for PT KAI to commit to a system-wide modernization program in which mechanical signal systems are phased out and existing usable systems are better integrated. In addition, there is also interest in advanced technologies such as on-board locomotive systems, positive train control and moving block signaling. According to the government's newly launched national economic corridors master plan for 2011 to 2025, Indonesia is now working to arrange a $35.4 billion in investment to improve the country's rail-based transportation system, and the National Railway Master Plan identified baseline investments needed for existing signaling and telecommunications infrastructure to total $1.3 billion ($996 million for Java and $293 million for Sumatra).</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $593,954 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Central Bank of Nigeria <br />Information Technology Department<br />Plot 33, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Way<br />Central Business District, Cadastral Zone, <br />Abuja, Federal Capital Territory<br />Nigeria</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform technical assistance to assist the Grantee in its effort to provide critical redundancy and information security to Nigeria's financial sector, while reducing the operating costs of Nigeria's banks.</p>
<p>The high cost of capital and stringent terms of repayment available from Nigeria's commercial banks have long represented a significant constraint on business development and economic growth in the country. To address the problem, CBN has advised Nigeria's commercial banks to reduce their operating costs by sharing power and ICT services where possible, with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost of capital in the Nigerian market. Although this is not presently a legal or regulatory requirement, the commercial banks are taking CBN's guidance seriously. In fact, the Chief Information Officers of 19 of Nigeria's commercial banks have formed the "CIO Nexus", a working group focused on planning the implementation of these shared services.</p>
<p>This USTDA-funded TA will perform an assessment of several of the participating banks' data backup systems and DRCs, and compile a common set of requirements and standards for the development of a shared DRC which would significantly reduce costs to the participating banks through the use of shared operational, power, climate control, and ICT services. The TA will also make recommendations on the operational and business models for the Project, including shared fee structures, requirements for use, and strategies for implementation. CBN is expected to take the lead on the implementation of the Project, but the member banks of the CIO Nexus have expressed their support for the Project and their desire to participate in this TA.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $510,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE: </span>There have been some questions concerning the security set out in sections 6.1.&nbsp; This section is being revised to strike the second sentence "some class discussions may be held up to the top secret level" .<br /></strong><br /><strong>NO CLASS DISCUSSIONS WILL BE HELD AT THE TOP SECRET LEVEL.&nbsp; We do not believe this has a material impact to the solicitation requirements.&nbsp; As such, we will not be pushing back the deadline date. &nbsp; <br /></strong><br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Procurement Section (PS) would like to provide a structured Professional Development Program (PDP) consistent with continuous learning needs for their procurement professionals to enhance their awareness, knowledge, competencies, and capabilities through learning and experience by using, capturing, and sharing knowledge to the overall benefit of the FBI's mission requirements. The overall objective is to create an evolutionary-future environment where employees are engaged and encouraged to take a leadership role in identifying and solving problems that benefit the procurement workforce, the customer and the FBI's mission needs.
<p>In order to create this environment the FBI PS believes that contracting professionals must not only have technical competence and broad contracting experience; but they must also demonstrate: <br />- Leader Competence<br />- Business Acumen<br />- Networking and Interpersonal Skills<br />- Customer Relationship Skills<br />- Embracing Accountability<br />- Listening Skills <br />- Coaching and Change Management Skills<br />- Communications Skills<br />- Sense of Community - with all players in the Acquisition Process<br />- Mutual Valuing</p>
<p>These values should be reflected in the PDP through all of the courses taught so that the contracting professional may hone their abilities as a competent and successful business professional, FBI mission partner and leader. The courses should be specifically tailored to provide skill set advancement for all contracting professionals in varying experience levels and background.</p>
<p>Tier 1: Entry-Level<br />The FBI PS has identified three tiers in which these courses should be grouped. The First Tier (Tier 1) will provide the path for contracting professionals who are in the beginner to novice phase of their profession. These entry level courses, taught to GS 7-11 contracting professionals, will reflect the values listed above, and provide a leadership foundation that the CO and CS will take with them throughout their career. Themes should be focused on what and why more than how.</p>
<p>Tier 2: Mid-Level<br />The Second Tier (Tier 2) will provide the skills needed for those contracting professionals who are beginning to come into their own as FBI leaders. These courses will be taught to GS 12-14 contracting professionals, and will reflect the values above, with an emphasis on mission value. The courses in this tier should provide the contracting professional with not only what and why, but the how, and provide these professionals the ability to take ownership of their skills. The courses should also reflect a participant input into learning about and developing their own leadership style. The Tier 2 professional should be approached in a manner consistent with their previous experience, with a lens towards the future challenges of becoming a true leader within the FBI.</p>
<p>Tier 3: Senior Level<br />The Third Tier (Tier 3) training will provide awareness for the experienced contracting professionals, who have been in a leadership role for some years, to shape those leaders coming in and provide the skills necessary to provide daily guidance to future leaders. Tier 3 contracting professionals will be GS-15 professionals who have provided the government with years of service in either a leadership or professional role. The courses in this tier should provide the contracting professional with the ability to pass on their skills, and foster an environment in which budding contracting professionals are encouraged to take ownership of their responsibilities and provide opportunities for the leaders of the future to develop and move into future roles. Themes should have a high-level focus, with a view towards the future of FBI contracting and creating an environment and legacy of success.<br /><br />Please Send all Questions</p>

Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>This is an announcement intended to clarify the NAICS coding for the S&TCD OMNIBUS effort.  The following information shall supercede any previous statements regarding NAICS codes for this project.<br><br>There are three NAICS codes expected to be applicable to this effort, namely:<br><br>541330 Engineering Services<br>541712 Research & Development in Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences<br>541990 All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services<br><br>Unfortunately the AFSI system allows for the selection of only one code with any given post.  I have selected 541330 in this case because announcements pertaining to this project have been previously posted under the other two.  By now including each of the three NAICS codes at least once, we can ensure maximum visibility among applicable interested parties.  Again, to restate: this is not a change to either of the codes previously used but rather a clarification that all three are considered applicable to the contemplated effort.

<DESC>***THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION** The US Army Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division on behalf of the United States Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is requesting information on a small footprint sanitation center for use in the Marine Corps Enhanced Tray Ration Heating System (ETRHS). The ETRHS is a 'kitchen in a box' that allows the Marine Corps food service personnel to prepare up to 250 rations per meal for the Marines on or close to the battlefield. The system has all of the equipment necessary to bake, boil and grill food but requires an additional capability to sanitize the cooking appliances, pots/pans and serving wares.<br>The Government is using this request for information to locate potential vendors that can meet the need for a sanitation center that can fit within the confines of the ETRHS. ***THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION***

<DESC><p>Background <br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS) Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) program is designed to promote the sustainability of the Medicare program by shifting Medicare beneficiaries' health care costs to private sources of payment, when available. The MSP law states that Medicare is prohibited from making payment where payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made by another insurer. In order to adhere to its statutory requirements, CMS' MSP program performs two primary functions: (1) coordinating benefits in order to ensure that Medicare pays properly, and (2) pursuing recoveries, where Medicare has paid conditionally and is entitled to reimbursement.&nbsp;<br /><br />CMS is seeking to establish a centralized Coordination of Benefits (COB) and Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery (MSPR) operation by consolidating under a single program, the performance of all activities that support the collection, management, and reporting of other insurance coverage of Medicare beneficiaries, and the collection of mistaken primary payments. These activities are currently being performed under two separate contracts. CMS intends to establish a centralized COB and MSPR operation that provides quality customer service and a single source to Medicare providers, suppliers, beneficiaries, insurers and other stakeholders by streamlining the MSP data and debt collection processes while ensuring the integrity of the Medicare Trust Funds.</p>
<p><br />Overall goals in this consolidation initiative are to:<br />&bull; Administer the MSP process more efficiently and effectively by providing a single contractor entity to operate, coordinate and maintain the MSP process and thus generate cost savings through a reduction in mistaken primary Medicare payments and identification of conditional Medicare payments.<br />&bull; Provide beneficiaries and their representatives with a more efficient, user friendly and less intrusive MSP identification and debt recovery operation by streamlining the process from the collection of MSP information through to the collection of debt. <br />&bull; Achieve other cost reductions and management efficiencies by consolidating performance of similar activities (e.g., mail-room activities, Customer Service / Help Desk activities, etc.) that are necessary to carry out daily operations.<br />&bull; Provide greater flexibility in contracting to ensure the best earned value for the government. <br />&bull; Enhance program integrity consistent with the objectives of the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP).</p>
<p><br />THE DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK IS ISSUED FOR COMMENTS ONLY. NO RESPONSES TO COMMENTS WILL BE GIVEN. NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED.</p>
<p>PLEASE SUBMIT COMMENTS AS AN ATTACHMENT TO THE E-MAIL.</p>

<DESC>This is Amendment #2 to the synopsis entitled 3.0 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging- MRI, NNJ12ZBH001L, which was posted on October 5, 2011. You are notified that theAmendment #2 supersede and replace the original Request for Information (RFI) in itsentirety with the following:This notice is issued by the NASA/JSC to post a Request for Information on Techniques forusing 3.0 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess trabecular and cortical bonemineral density at central sties via the internet, and solicit responses from interestedparties. Request for Information (RFI): It is well established that bone mineral density (BMD)loss is rapid (1-1.5%/mo) and site-specific (axial and load-bearing sites) during longduration spaceflight. This loss occurs faster in the trabecular compartment than in thecortical compartment. A decreased BMD can be accompanied by other changes in bonestructure which increase the risk for bone fracture and early onset osteoporosis. Bonefracture could have serious implications for a long duration mission. Moreover, the riskfor early onset osteoporosis could limit the astronauts quality of life and careerlength. The current techniques used to evaluate BMD are Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)and Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT). BMD has the advantage of abundantepidemiological studies completed with its use, but it only provides integral (combinedcortical and trabecular bone); whereas BMDs of the separate compartments are importantfor understanding changes in bone structure vs. the remodeling of bone tissue. QCT hasbeen valuable and informative when used to measure BMD of the two compartments in the hipand spine, but it is a research technology for which clinical implications have yet to beestablished. Both DXA and QCT use ionizing radiation, which is undesirable since astronauts arescanned repeatedly to assess changes over time. It is important to minimize this exposureas can be reasonably achieved. Astronauts are already exposed to higher than normallevels of radiation during spaceflight. Therefore, DXA and other X-ray based technologiesare not optimal for quantifying the changes in trabecular and cortical bone mineraldensity. The astronaut population is currently being evaluated with 3.0 Tesla MRI scans forclinical monitoring and ongoing research protocols. NASA is interested in learning ifthere are techniques in development that could use MR technology to understand changes inbone mass and bone structure. The advantages of this modality are the resolution, lack ofionizing radiation, and decrease in astronaut crew time by having all studies performedat a single site. This Request for Information: 1. Is there a non-invasive technique that can utilize standard 3.0 Tesla clinicalMagnetic Resonance instruments to assess changes in bone mass in the trabecular andcortical sub-regions of bone similar to x-ray based modalities?  We are most interestedin a technique for clinically-relevant sites of the central skeleton (proximal femur,femoral neck and spine). 2. If such a novel technique exists, how does the techniques reproducibility andaccuracy compare to measures by X-ray based modalities (DXA and QCT)? 3. What is the feasibility of adopting this novel MR-based technology? a. What are the risks associated with the technique? b. What are the initial cost and operational/maintenance cost?c. Are all the required components readily available or is specialized instrumentationrequired? d. What errors do you expect from spinal degenerative changes or aortic calcification? e. How does the technique correct for movement and water mass? 4. Can this technique provide information on bone morphometry? 5. Is this technique validated for making clinical decisions to improve outcomesregarding fracture risk and early onset osteoporosis (e.g. responsive to therapies,monitoring progression of pathologies)? 6. Are there other solutions with non-ionizing radiation (besides a possible 3.0 TeslaMRI) that could provide us this information? This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry theopportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well aspromote competition. Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments orquestions to: Cheryl Bass via e-mail, cheryl.d.bass@nasa.gov, no later than November 1,2011. When responding reference NNJ12ZBH001L - 3.0 Tesla MRI. Comments may be forwarded to Cheryl Bass via electronic transmission.This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government,nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents willnot be notified of the results.An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with CGI Federal Inc., 12601 Fair Lakes Circle, Fairfax, VA 22033 for Information Technology (IT) Support Services for the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JSFPO). The Government intends to procure the above services under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1, to ensure there will not be a break in the services required, while a competitive Seaport-e Task Order is being put in place. The period of performance on this procurement will be twelve months from date of award, with two (2) three-month option periods.
<p>The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) (F-35) program is a joint DoD ACAT 1D major acquisition program that includes the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps. JSF also includes eight foreign partner countries formally identified as Cooperative Partner Participants (CPP) along with two other countries called Security Cooperative Participants (SCP). Because of the international nature of the program, combined with the highly sensitive technologies being designed into the total air system, IT Services are mission critical. The IT Support Services for over 2,000 personnel in more than seven geographically separated government and contractor sites include providing data storage service for the JSFPO; providing network connectivity to all of the field sites; maintenance of the network including help desk support of 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days a year; providing, maintaining, and accounting for all of the IT hardware both at the classified and unclassified level; maintaining all encrypted networks throughout the country; developing unique software critical to the design and development of the architecture networks; and telephone, teleconferencing, and video teleconferencing.</p>
<p>CGI Federal Inc. is currently supplying the support services for this requirement. It is in the Government's best interest to issue a new contract to CGI Federal Inc. for a continuation of services. This will insure there will not be a break in the services required, which would cause the entire JSF Program to seize operation.</p>
<p>This contract is being processed solely for the purpose to insure continuity of services to avoid interruption of program support. There is a competitive SEAPORT-e package in process for the contractor support service requirements. This sole source action is a temporary bridge for the continuation of services until the SEAPORT-e Task Order is in place. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice. Any responses should reference N68335-11-R-0057. The Point of Contact is Ms. Rachel Bogner, email rachel.bogner@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br>Title:  Games for Training (GFT) Flagship Recompete<br>Contract Vehicle:  TBD<br>Closing Date:  31 October 2011<br>Brief Summary:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is conducting market research to determine interested sources and technology capabilities of contractors (both large and small) for the procurement of a new Flagship First Person Shooter (FPS).  The new FPS based game and tools should include, but is not limited, to the components and capabilities of the current FPS game, Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS2), as described in this Sources Sought Program Description.<br>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  PEO STRI, through requirements provided by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capabilities Manager, has a need for an FPS game to train individual Soldiers and small units in a shared semi-immersive environment.  This notice is provided to inform industry partners and solicit industry capabilities to fulfill the requirements and level of interest for the current GFT Flagship game-based simulation.  Part of the Army strategy for execution of the GFT program is to take advantage of new gaming technologies available in the commercial market whenever possible given the appropriate level of resources.  The Flagship recompete will manifest that strategy by acquiring improved technologies similar to user friendly software development, higher fidelity graphics, an ability to move across PC-platforms, web-based and mobile, and an improved interoperability capability to integrate seamlessly into the Live-Virtual-Constructive environment.    <br>GFT game-based technologies provide semi-immersive, experiential learning opportunities to familiarize and train Soldiers in various tactical scenarios and environments.  This technology can be used to develop, train, and evaluate the decision making processes for the individual leaders as well as enhance teamwork at all levels.  The successful product will provide preplanned scenarios resembling the ones currently a part of the flagship baseline  along with the capability for the User to rapidly generate custom scenarios (both in preparation for a training event and in real time in the game) that provide training and education in subjects such as stability operations, cultural awareness, language, combat lifesaver skills, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) recognition and defeat, and various other skills required for current and future military operations - a flexible Full Spectrum Operations capability. <br>The current GFT flagship product, VBS2, was procured in a competitive source selection in Dec 08.  Over the last three years, the product has evolved to include capabilities such as terrain paging, improved graphic realism, IED training modules, insurgent methodology training scenarios, Special Operations Command (SOCOM) enhancements, an improved cultural and language training capability, and a terrain database plug-in that will facilitate incorporation of Synthetic Environment (SE) Core databases.  The Government has also invested in several middleware capabilities that provide additional features such as enhanced indirect fire skills training and combat lifesaver and medic training.  The required product will provide the User the ability to connect existing and future middleware via an Application Programming Interface (API) or plug-in.  This will enable the addition of new training capabilities for seamless training using the Flagship game as the user interface.  This will ensure the reuse of a multitude of Governmental and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) products and features already developed.   <br>Potential future capabilities that may be included in the Flagship acquisition, or as separate efforts, are as follows:<br>     1.  Construction and Management Simulation (CMS) <br>     This requirement is for a CMS game to support full spectrum operations that includes lethal and non-lethal tasks and missions.  The gaming solution must portray the political, military, economic, social, informational, and infrastructural(PMESII) conditions and associated 2d and higher order effects of decision-making relative to those conditions.  This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br>     2.  Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Games (MMOG)<br>     Future procurement may include an MMOG game to support mission rehearsals and mission planning. The requirement  will allow stimulation of mission (formerly battle) command systems and other training aids, devices, simulations, and simulators (TADSS). This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br>     3.  Real Time Strategy (RTS)<br>      Plans for FY13 and beyond may include procurement of an RTS game to support full spectrum operations. This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br>     4.  Turn Based Strategy (TBS) <br>     Future procurement endeavors may include a TBS game to support decision making skills at all force echelons. This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br>Constraints<br>	1.  The contractor shall provide all the features of VBS2.<br>	2.  The contractor shall use industry standards for model, terrain and other content imported into the game. <br>	3.  The Flagship will be capable of importing and exporting Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) simulation terrain and Common Moving Models as well as One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) behavioral models.<br>VBS2 FEATURES:   VBS2 software is currently available for purchase.  Once the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) is posted, the Government will provide copies to potential offerors as temporary Government Furnished Information.<br>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates this requirement be fulfilled by a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government intends to award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  Interested parties are requested to review the requirements and information stated herein and to submit a written response by the closing date of this posting.  The industry feedback received will allow PEO STRI to validate cost and schedule projections in order to allocate funds to satisfy this requirement.<br><br>QUANTITIES:  The acquisition will be for an Army-wide or enterprise license for one or more commercial games.<br>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  Approximately $25 million over five years. The majority of the cost is expected to be an annual licensing fee that includes an update and technical support for the software.<br>RESPONSES REQUESTED:  The Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) requests contractors who are are a part of the existing PEO STRI Omnibus II (STOC II) Contract and Contractors who are responding to the duplicate SSN posted on FEDBIZOPPS must submit their responses to all the following POC's Michael.Adorno@us.army.mil, Richard.Boast1@us.army.mil; Eric.Hertl@us.army.mil with a copy to Leslie.Dubow@us.army.mil and Wallace.Tennille@us.army.mil.

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) Scott Field Office will issue a sole source modification to contract HC1013-09-D-2000 for First Air Force-Air Forces Northern (1 AF-AFNORTH), Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and the 611th Air Communications Squadron (611 ACOMS) at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska (on behalf of PACAF and Eleventh Air Force). The current contract contains Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity for maintenance, with Fixed Price, Time and Materials delivery orders for system changes. The current contract was competitively awarded to General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), Inc.</p>
<p>HC1013-09-D-2000 supports the mission of maintaining command and control of airspace defense, air sovereignty and supporting Homeland Defense/Security and law enforcement efforts in counter-narco-terrorism for the United States, Canada and their respective states, territories and provinces, to include those in the Pacific and Caribbean. North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM, or NORTHCOM) are tasked for North America. Commander, NORAD (CDRNORAD)/Commander USNORTHCOM requires mission performance on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week (24/7) basis. The Hawaii Air National Guard and Guam Air National Guard are tasked for Pacific area air defense 24/7. Command and Control (C2) consists of processing data, voice and other sensor and information inputs into capability commanders utilize to direct assets in the prosecution of the mission.</p>
<p>This sole source modification will task GDIT to implement one new requirement; a Voice Console Replacement System. <br />The current voice console systems in operation at five geographically separate locations, Eastern Battle Control Center (BCC), Western BCC, CONUS NORAD Region (CONR) Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC), Alaska NORAD Region (ANR) Air Defense Sector (ADS) and the Hawaii Region AOC (HIRAOC) will be completely removed and replaced with a new system. The voice console system provides access to telephone lines and radios. All radios used by the ADSs, BCCs and AOCs are accessed using the voice console system, making it the single and only way to communicate with aircraft. <br />Any interested party may submit a proposal for this effort to the attention of the Contracting Officer. The proposal must describe how the interested party will meet the Single System Manger and Contractor Offline Facility requirements of the statement of work. In addition, the interested party needs to describe how they will integrate a new VCRS into the five geographically separate locations, fit it within the existing architecture and physical space and also ensure the existing systems remain fully operational with no loss or decrease in operational availability.. In accordance with Federal Acquisiton Regulation 5.203(c), the closing date for proposals is established as 1500 hours, Central Daylight Savings Time,&nbsp;31 October 2011.</p>

THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES.</p>
<p>1.0 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) by the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) seeks industry response on the performance of IT Support for the TMA E-Commerce System (TMA ECS) applications. TMA is conducting market research to identify candidate organizations that possess appropriate technical expertise, experience, and resources to provide IT support services. This market research may also assist with the further development and/or refinement of requirements. Information will be reviewed and considered during the development of a Request for Proposals.</p>
<p>2.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>TRICARE is a healthcare program of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) which serves active duty and retired military personnel, other uniformed service personnel, and their dependents. The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is accountable for the management and operation of the TRICARE program to ensure delivery of direct military health care to DoD and other beneficiaries. It supplements direct care through the use of private-sector care services via managed care support contracts. The TMA has central administrative and management facilities in Falls Church, Virginia and Aurora, Colorado. It also operates regional offices in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; San Antonio, Texas; San Diego, California; and Arlington, Virginia. More specifically, TMA-Aurora is responsible for private-sector care activities to include the specification of managed care requirements, the issuance of health care contracts, the management of contract activities, the processing and payment of healthcare claims, and the recording and reporting of financial transactions.</p>
<p>In support of these TMA operations, TMA-Aurora has implemented an E-Commerce Program, which provides an integrated set of financial, contract management, and acquisition support systems to include:</p>
<p>&bull; the Oracle Federal Financials (OFF) 10i application is a UNIX based, Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) system which supports health care claims processing, budget management, and accounting;<br />&bull; the E-Commerce Data Warehouse (EDW) application is a UNIX-based, business intelligence application that uses Oracle 11g as the database engine, Informatica for Extract, Transform and Load (ETL), Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE);<br />&bull; the Management Tracking and Reporting (MTR) and Extranet applications are Windows based, custom-built applications (using ColdFusion and Oracle 11g) that provide a mechanism to track TRICARE program requirement changes, receive contractor deliverables, provide for cross platform reporting, and support contract Performance Assessment;<br />&bull; the PRISM application is a CompuSearch COTS product that provides contract writing, acquisition support, solicitation and contract management capabilities for TMA purchased care and simplified acquisition activities.

The system runs on multiple, Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) provided Windows platforms using a J2EE compliant architecture and WEB browser interface.</p>
<p>The primary objective of E-Commerce Operational Systems Support services is to perform support services to accomplish Sustainment Engineering, Enhancement Engineering, and Engineering Management for the TMA E-Commerce applications, and to conduct DISA infrastructure coordination.

<DESC>This solicitation has been cancelled for the following reasons:
<p>USCG, CEU-Providence did not receive adequate funding to award the subject project prior to November 6, 2011 when the current bids expire. The performance period for the anticipated work is 125 days and requires temperatures above 40 degrees F due to the roofing and masonry repairs. As a result, CEU-Providence is going to let the current bids expire on&nbsp;November 6, 2011 and re-solicit the design package this winter with the intent of making a Spring 2012 contract award.</p>

<AWARDEE>Heuristic Management, LLC
<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development requires an External Private Sector Advisor to support the Bureau for Food Security's Markets, Partnerships, and Innovation Office to facilitate partnerships and management knowledge through the development of the Feed the Future Private Sector Engagement Hub.<br /><br />The Bureau for Food Security requires this support immediately. Private sector engagement is critical to the success of the initiative. Per FAR 13.106(b), the contracting officer determined that the urgency of the requirement deemed only one source available. The urgency of the requirement, coupled with the dollar value, justify use of a firm-fixed price, sole source award.
<p>Heuristic Management LLC possesses a predominant capability in this very specific subset of skills necessary for the development of the Hub, including an in-depth knowledge of the U.S. and multinational private sector, capital markets, and business development, along with expertise in the areas of hunger, agricultural development, and gender equality. The expertise possessed by Heuristic Management LLC is urgently needed to allow the Markets, Partnerships, and Innovation Office in the Bureau for Food Security to develop the materials for this portal and to deliver information to external partners in a concise and systematic manner.</p>
