<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), will be soliciting offers for a contract(s) to survey trees for detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in conjunction with officials of the State of Illinois.  APHIS is planning to survey trees that are hosts for the ALB for signs of infestation.  The program is necessary to reduce the potential for damage of tress from this major pest.  The Asian longhorned beetle bores into and kills a variety of tree species including f maple, elm, chestnut, birch, poplar, ash, and willow.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture has declared an emergency and is committing extensive resources to eliminate this pest and restore the urban forest.  The work will include survey by bucket truck, tree climber, or any other means to thoroughly inspect trees on public and private property as directed.  The Asian longhorned beetle currently infests the following areas in the Chicago area of the State of Illinois:  Chicago, Revenswood, Kilbourn Park, Addison (DuPage County), Summit and All Saints.  APHIS reserves the right to award more than one contract, however, at this time the Contracting Officer anticipates awarding a single contract for the Chicago area.  Firm-fixed price contract(s) will be awarded, covering the period from date of award (approximately on or before January 12, 2004), through September 30, 2004, and will include four unilateral option years.  A post award orientation will be scheduled approximately on or before January 22, 2004. Tree surveyings will begin approximately on February 1, 2004.  SIC Code:  0783; Small Business Size Standard: $5.0 million average annual receipts over three years.  All responsible sources may submit an offer for consideration, however, evaluation preference will be given to responsive and responsible offerors that qualify as Hubzone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, or women-owned small businesses, in accordance with the evaluation criteria identified for the solicitation.  The solicitation will be released on or about December 15, 2003.  To download a copy of the solicitation, please visit our web site at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html.  The government intends to provide the solicitation and all amendments via this web site only.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is issuing a Pre-Solicitation Synopsis to seek qualified sources capable of performing independent Information Technology Product Assurance (ITPA) services in support of the design, development, and implementation of new automated systems, enhancement of existing systems, and designing and implementing changes to the infrastructure that will provide support to the patent and trademark application processing and examination functions, USPTO management and administrative systems, and dissemination of patent and trademark information to the public.   The current contract is 50-PAPT-9-00001, and the contractor is Galaxy Scientific Corporation.  A copy of the contract has been posted at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/itpa/itpa.htm.  The USPTO intends on awarding a follow-on contract in April 2004 to allow sufficient time for transition of the current contract which expires June 30, 2004.

This procurement will utilize the newly issued Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) which is available at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/.  Under PTAG, FAR Part 15 does not apply and “full and open competition” is replaced with “maximum reasonable competition” which authorizes the USPTO to limit the number of offerors to a predetermined number. Upon review of the responses to this Sources Sought/Synopsis, the top 5 highest ranked offerors will be notified and instructed on the next phase of the procurement process which will be the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Those vendors who are determined not to be the most qualified will be advised and will not receive further consideration.  To determine the top 5 highest ranked vendors, the USPTO will evaluate offerors’ responses and rank the offerors in terms of qualifications and highest probability to successfully fulfill the USPTO’s requirements.  Ultimate source selection will be based upon a best value determination.  This procurement is UNRESTRICTED.

Interested offerors shall submit a capability statement, not to exceed 20 pages, that demonstrates the offeror’s qualifications and capability to fulfill the USPTO’s requirements which are outlined in the attached Statement of Work.  The capability statement shall address the following: (1) proposed key personnel and a description of their functional qualifications and prior work experiences, (2) past performance information that shall include a description of at least three previous or current contracts that demonstrate a proven ability to meet the USPTO’s requirements and describe their relevance to the USPTO’s effort in terms of similarity to scope and size, (3) technical capabilities in relation to the USPTO’s requirements, (4) the proposed place of performance, and (5) available resources or plan to acquire necessary resources.  In addition to these five elements, vendors may provide any information that they deem pertinent to demonstrate their qualifications and ability to fulfill the USPTO’s requirements within the prescribed 20-page limit.   Prospective offerors must respond to this Pre-solicitation announcement in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  Capability statements shall be submitted electronically via email in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format to susan.messina@uspto.gov no later than January 6, 2004.   The USPTO will confirm receipt of all submissions.  Late submissions will not be accepted.

There will be a pre-bidders conference (i.e., “Industry Day) to provide an overview of the PTAG and to answer questions regarding this requirement. Industry Day has been tentatively scheduled for December 10th and it will be held at the USPTO in Arlington, Virginia.  All offerors interested in attending Industry Day conference must make a reservation by sending an email to susan.messina@uspto.gov.   All reservation requests shall be received no later than December 8, 2003.   Email requests shall include the company name and number and name of attendees, and a specific contact person and email address that can be reached to provide further information regarding the conference such as the exact location and special instructions.  The USPTO will be sending this email with further information on December 9, 2003.  Alternate arrangements will not be made on an individual basis if an offeror is unable to attend the pre-bidders conference.  The date for the Industry Date is subject to change and the number of attendees may need to be limited due to space restrictions.  

In addition to the capability statement that is required for further consideration in the acquisition process, vendors are also invited to submit additional discretionary information for consideration by the USPTO in formulating the resultant RFP.   The USPTO invites industry comments on the technical requirements to enable the USPTO to validate that the technical requirements specified in the Statement of Work represent a “best practice”.  Also, any suggestions on evaluation factors to consider for source selection or any other considerations that the USPTO may be failing to take into account are welcome and may be submitted to the Contracting Officer’s attention at susan.messina@uspto.gov.  

Since all procurement-related documents will be released via the Internet, a mailing list and list of interest vendors will not be available. However, firms are encouraged to have teaming arrangements with vendors that may have experience in this work.  The USPTO promotes socio-economic programs so teaming with small, minority-owned, woman-owned, HUB-Zone, and veteran-owned businesses is strongly encouraged.

Offerors are advised to register to receive notifications on www.FedBizOpps.gov for any amendments to this notice.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR SYSCOM) intends to award a commercial bridging contract vehicle for a maximum of nine (9) months for continued Program Support Associates (PSA) software engineering support of the FMIS 2000 software application.  The maximum period of performance will run from 1 January through 30 September 2004. This contract vehicle will provide operations/maintenance, systems analysis and corrections of the existing FMIS code for SPAWAR SYSCOM Code 01BRM, while awaiting a combined Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) contract. The estimated value of this bridging action is between $85,000 to $300,000. SPAWAR is not competing this requirement, as PSA (purchased by Titan/ACS) has been the sole design agent for FMIS.  PSA is the only known responsible source capable of providing a complete knowledge of the highly specialized design and coding of the FMIS software system and data base structures during this period of time without the Navy incurring unacceptable delays and costs while awaiting the NAVSEA contract. This  notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within twenty (20) days from the date of this synopsis (2:00 pm, Pacific Standard Time, 18 December 2003) will be considered by the Government.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Synopsis 
This is a Corrected Pre-Solicitation Notice.  Two Phase design/build Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AS UNRESTRICTED. The acquisition is being conducted using full and open competition (unrestricted) and is therefore subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.219-4, “Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hubzone Small Business Concerns”. This solicitation will result in award of the Multiple Award Construction Contract - III (MACC-III).  The MACC III may include up to five (5) Indefinite Quantity contracts with firm fixed price task orders to be placed thereunder.  The contracts are for a base year and three one-year option periods.  A set maximum amount for all task orders to be issued has been established for each year, which includes up to $35 million for the first year, up to $20 million for the second year, up to $25 million for the third year, and up to $20 million for the fourth year.  The total amount for all task orders issued during the four year term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded, will not exceed $100,000,000.  Task orders issued under this contract will range from $3,000,000 to $20,000,000; however, smaller and larger dollar value projects may be considered.  Future task orders will be competed only among the successful contractors.  Award of each future task order may be based on either Best Value to the Government or low price.  Future task orders may require multi-disciplined engineering and design services in all aspects of construction for new and renovation projects.  Environmental engineering services, including analysis of requirements, preparation of permit applications and design may also be required.  All key professional disciplines shall be registered.  The work contemplated under this procurement will include new construction, alterations, renovations, maintenance, repairs, and design-build projects, but fully designed projects may also be competed under these contracts.  Projects may include asbestos/lead based paint removal, demolition, proprietary items and options. A significant number of design-build or performance based task orders may be placed under the resultant contracts.  The work under the MACC-III contracts will be concentrated in, but not limited to, Engineering Field Activity Northeast’s 10 state area of responsibility, which includes Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware.   It is intended to award up to five (5) separate Indefinite Quantity contracts encompassing a base period of 365 calendar days and three one year options which may be exercised by the Government during which separate task orders for projects will be placed.  The Government reserves the right to award up to five contracts under this solicitation or to award only one contract covering only the seed project identified under the solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System, NAICS, Code of 236220, and the small business size standard of $28.5 million are applicable to the seed project.  Award of the seed project will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to this solicitation, is considered to be the most advantageous to the Government as a result of a Best Value evaluation with price and technical evaluation factors being approximately equal in importance.  Two-phase design-build Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  The evaluation factors under Phase-One may include the following:  1) Relevant Past Performance; 2) Management Approach; 3) Technical Experience, Expertise, and Qualifications, 4) Commitment to Small Business Concerns, and 5) Safety Record.  Offerors will be required to provide information for both their construction team, as well as their design team under these factors.  Based on its evaluation of the Phase –One, the DON will invite up to eight (8) offerors judged best qualified for this MACC-III, as well as, the seed project, Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ), Naval Academy Prep School (NAPS), Naval Station Newport, RI, to participate in Phase-Two.   Offerors selected to participate in Phase – Two will be provided the RFP including technical plans and specifications for the BEQ NAPS, at the Naval Station Newport, RI.  Phase-Two will consist of Price and Technical proposals.  The seed project will also be evaluated as to price reasonableness.  Phase –Two technical evaluation factors may include the following:  1) The Overall Aggregate Technical Rating Received for Phase One; 2) Technical Approach to Seed Project; and 3) Seed Project Management Plan.  The award of the seed project will meet the minimum guaranteed amount of $25,000.  The aggregate maximum value of all contracts awarded under this MACC will be $100 million over the 4 years of contract performance.  A bid guarantee (Standard Form 24) executed by a surety company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury as an acceptable surety, or other security as provided in FAR Clause 52.228-1, “Bid Guarantee” will be required for the seed project and every project solicited under this contract during the term of the contract.  All task orders will require payment and performance bonds.  The scope of the seed project is the design and construction of the BEQ, at the NAPS, Naval Station Newport, RI.  The BEQ NAPS shall be configured as described herein.  It shall be used for bachelor housing for students at the Naval Academy Prep School.  It shall be a multi-story structural steel framed building consisting of a maximum total gross area of 7,110 square meters.  The BEQ NAPS shall provide berthing for a minimum of 320 students in (80) 2+2 modules, however, the Contractor shall maximize the building space to provide as many 2+2 modules as possible within the allowable gross building area.

<RESPDATE>021704
<ARCHDATE>04172004
<CONTACT>Patricia Evans, 301-619-7354
<DESC>NA The intent of the Exploration Hypothesis Development Award is to provide funds to support initial exploration of innovative, untested, potentially groundbreaking concepts in chronic myelogenous leukemia.  Results of studies conducted through an Exploration  Hypothesis Development Award may provide the scientific rationale upon which a new hypothesis can be based or may provide, for example, initial proof of principles of an innovative hypothesis.  The award is designed to provide investigators with the oppor tunity to pursue serendipitous observations.  Some gaps in supporting rationale may exist due to lack of available information.  The Exploration Hypothesis Development Award is not intended to support ongoing work.  Therefore, the existence of preliminary data suggests that the research would be more appropriately submitted to a different award mechanism.  Successfully completed Exploration Hypothesis Development Awards are expected to lead to high-risk, potentially high-gain future research endeavors for t his and other funding agencies. Due to the preliminary nature of the studies being supported by this award, projects involving human subjects or specimens will not be supported unless they are exempt under 32 CFR 219.101(b)(4)  or eligible for expedited re view (45 CFR 46.110, 21 CFR 56.110).    Studies that do not qualify for exempt or expedited status during review at any level will be administratively withdrawn and will not be funded. Funding for Exploration Hypothesis Development Awards can be requested for a maximum of $100,000 inclusive of direct and indirect costs for up to an 18-month performance period.  Projects requiring lower levels of funding may also be submitted.  These fund s can cover salary, expenses including research supplies, and travel to scientific/technical meetings.  The amount allotted for travel is $1,800.  The nature of the CMLRP does not allow for renewal of grants or supplementation of existing grants.  Approxim ately $1.2M is available to the CMLRP for research under this announcement.  Depending on the quality and the number of proposals received it is anticipated that 12 Exploration Hypothesis Development Awards will be funded. The Exploration Hypothesis Development Award Announcement was released on November 26, 2003 with a submission deadline of February 17, 2004, 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  Detailed descriptions of the funding mechanism, evaluation criteria, and submission requir ements can be downloaded from the CDRMP web site (http://cdmrp.army.mil).  All applicants will be required to submit one electronic versions of their proposal as a PDF (portable document format) file.  All documents may be downloaded from the CDMRP website . The website also contains further information about the, CMLRP, CMLRP awardees, previous CMLRP Program Announcements, and other CDMRP sponsored programs and events. Again the CDMRP web site is located at (http://cdmrp.army.mil). Questions related to the Program, proposal format or required documentation can be addressed to the CDMRP at 301-619-7079, Fax at 301-619-7792 or email at cdmrp.pa@det.amedd.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>SPAWAR FMIS SUPPORT
<DESC>D -- Information Technology Services, Including Telecommunications Services. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR SYSCOM), 4301 Pacific Hwy, San Diego CA, intends to award a commercial bridging contract vehicle for a maximum of nine (9) months for continued Program Support Associates (PSA) software engineering support of the FMIS 2000 software application.  The maximum period of performance will run from 1 January through 30 September 2004. This contract vehicle will provide operations/maintenance, systems analysis and corrections of the existing FMIS code for SPAWAR SYSCOM Code 01BRM, while awaiting a combined Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) contract (FBO#0524). The estimated value of this bridging action is between $85,000 to $300,000. SPAWAR is not competing this requirement, as PSA (purchased by Titan/ACS) has been the sole design agent for FMIS.  PSA is the only known responsible source capable of providing a complete knowledge of the highly specialized design and coding of the FMIS software system and data base structures during this period of time without the Navy incurring unacceptable delays and costs while awaiting the NAVSEA contract. This  notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within twenty (20) days from the date of this synopsis (by 2:00 pm, Pacific Standard Time, 18 December 2003) will be considered by the Government. POC:  Kimerly R.
