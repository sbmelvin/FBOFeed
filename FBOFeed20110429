<SUBJECT>AB Sciex Maintenance Agreement

<RESPDATE>031711
<CONTACT>Thaddeus E Rollins, Phone 770-488-2427, Fax 770-488-2670, Email tnr6@cdc.gov - Vallerie M Redd, Contract Specialist, Phone 770-488-2845, Fax 770-488-2670, Email gfj3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price maintenance agreement contract to AB Sciex LLC, 110 Marsh Road, Foster City, CA 94404. The contract will be for a base year of 12 months with 4 option years of 12 months each.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.</p>
<p>AB Sciex LLC is the sole manufacturer of the AB Sciex mass spectrometers that is needed to be maintained. The Division of Laboratory Sciences utilizes a variety of mass spectrometers from AB Sciex to accomplish its public health mission. These mass spectrometers are used in analyses performed for chemical terrorism/emergency response, and in research and development to establish new analytical methods for a broad variety of sample types. These instruments are used in mission critical research projects and analyses for DLS, and it is crucial that they are not allowed to be off of a service agreement for any period of time.</p>
<p>While there are other independent companies that can service the mass spectrometry equipment in question, those companies will always have to contact AB Sciex for technical/software updates and factory certified replacement components. Such an arrangement could significantly slow down the process of keeping mass spectrometers maintained and repaired that are involved in mission critical experiments and that are required for emergency/terrorism response. The service engineers with AB Sciex are highly experienced with the equipment itself and with understanding the critical requirements in place due to our division's emergency response duties. Additionally their engineers have been factory trained and certified for repairs and maintenance of AB Sciex mass spectrometers as well as being experts in the repair of related gas generators from Parker Balston and Peak Scientific which are attached to AB Sciex mass spectrometers. AB Sciex sells these gas generators as part of their mass spectrometry systems and can offer service at competitive rates.</p>
<p>AB Sciex (formerly Applied Biosystems Inc.) has proven to be knowledgeable, reliable, and efficient regarding installation, repair, and maintenance of their mass spectrometers and the associated gas generators. Additionally, AB Sciex is clearly able to communicate on the status of equipment maintenance and repair projects. Their field service representatives provided prompt responses to all CDC needs. AB Sciex provides on-site, dedicated engineers so that response is virtually immediate. They also maintained an on-site inventory of replacement parts and equipment so that in the case of instrument failures repair and service requests require the least amount of time possible.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to AB Sciex LLC. CDC believes that AB Sciex LLC is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Thaddeus Rollins via email to tnr6@cdc.gov<br />using solicitation number 2011-N-13270 in the subject line, no later than 11:59 pm Eastern Time, 17 March 2011.</p>

The sole source contractor for this requirement is the University of Alabama - Birmingham (UAB), 701 S 20th St., Birmingham, AL 35294. The proposed contract will be to conduct a 36 month follow up study to the Anniston Community Health Survey originally conducted in 2005 - 2007 after preliminary work done by the Anniston Environmental Health Consortium in 2003 - 2005. The study will involve the enrollment of up to 500 participants from the original study and measure dioxin-like compounds in addition to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to examine associations with heart disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and thyroid disease. This contract will pertain to enrollment and physical examination of the participants, collection of data through questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, and collection of biological samples.

UAB provided the structural framework and staff for the consortium through their Survey Examination Unit and approval of the consortium activities including protocol, informed consents, and questionnaire, and biological samples collection through its Institutional Review Board. UAB completed and maintains the enrollment and data and sample collection for the original Anniston Community Health Survey conducted in 2005 - 2007.

<DESC>In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Manangement System paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform the industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source 42 month, bridge contract, including options, to Harris Corporation to provide continued flight service operations in Alaska. The value for this bridge contract is $56.7 million. 
The current FAA contract with Harris Corporation (Contract # DTFA01-97-C-00070) for operation and support of the Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS) flight service automation system expires on August 24, 2011. The contract milestones assumed the end of flight service operations using OASIS in June 2011, OASIS de-installation in July 2011, and program closeout in August 2011. 
The rationale for the single source bridge contract is based on the conclusion that Harris Corporation is the only vendor that could provide continued flight service in Alaska in the timeframe stated in Market Survey #9982 (Market Survey Assessment for continued flight service operations in Alaska) posted August 31, 2010. Due to time restraints, the FAA determined that it is not feasible to competitively award a contract for a new automation system and achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in Alaska by July 1, 2011.  A continuation of current flight service system in Alaska represents the lowest risk interim solution to the Government.
In addition, Flight Services anticipates a requirement for a single Flight Services automation system, which combines the requirements for both Alaska and CONUS. The requirement is designated as the Meteorological and Aeronautical Planning System (MAPS). A bridge contract is needed to fulfill the immediate Alaskan flight service operations requirement until the competitively acquired MAPS system is operational. A competitive procurement for the MAPS is anticipated in FY 12.
This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Michele Petrone, Contracting Officer, via phone at (202) 385-7518 or via email at michele.petrone@faa.gov by 3:30 PM EST, May 6, 2011.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has a requirement for Standard Missile - 3 (SM-3) Block IA missiles. This effort is part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program. Contract N00024-07-C-6119 was awarded as a sole source contract to Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ, for the production of the SM-3 Block IA and Block IB missiles and spares. MDA intends to issue a contract modification for up to thirty (30) additional Block IA missiles. Raytheon Missile Systems has been the All Up Round Design Agent for all Standard Missile variants since 1966. Therefore, the contractor possesses the unique knowledge, background, resources, and technical expertise related to this complex and highly specialized system to provide the required SM-3 Block IA configuration. This expertise cannot be attained by any other contractor within the anticipated period of performance without incurring a substantial duplication of costs and an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the Agency's requirements. The proposed contract action is for missile production for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon Missile Systems directly.

<DESC>Military tactical mission requirements include distributed Command and Control (C2), Situational Awareness (SA), navigation, and Cooperative Integrated Fire Control (CIFC). It is critical to collaborate, coordinate and rapidly disseminate combat ID, classification and target assignments across shooters, sensors and weapons. Headway has been made; however, there is an urgent need for increased connectivity and capacity between the tactical and airborne domain to exploit complementary C2, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting for greater mission effectiveness
<p>Current tactical communication capabilities have limited throughput and scalability, insufficient AJ (anti-jam) and LPE (low probability of exploitation) capability, and high latency and network join times. Link-16, the most widely used airborne tactical data link, provides C2, SA, weapons coordination, electronic warfare, and other capabilities, but does not meet emerging throughput, scalability, and latency requirements, especially in high electronic attack environments. Developed in the 1970's, Link-16 still meets the needs for a wide range of missions. Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and Cooperative Engagement Capability - Data Distribution System (CEC-DDS) use directional antennas to provide low probability of detection and a high degree of resistance against jamming respectively; however, they are limited in terms of interoperability, configurability, scalability and latency.</p>
<p>There is a need for an Advanced Tactical Data Link (ATDL) with technologies to provide the capability to complement these existing links to support naval integrated sensing and weapons coordination and control across air, maritime and ground domains for both manned and unmanned platforms. Such technologies must be auto-configuring and self-adapting network technologies which provide high data bandwidth and low latency communication for integrated sensing and cooperative integrated fire control. Furthermore, these technologies must be jam-resistant, and solutions such as wideband communications, novel antenna techniques, etc. should be considered. Such technologies must also be cost effective and integratable across a variety of platforms.</p>
<p>ONR Code 31 seeks proposals for efforts that develop and demonstrate such technologies. These technologies are considered required to enable improvements throughout the communications realms of interest.</p>
<p>This effort will develop Science and Technology (S&amp;T) technologies and products that significantly enhance tactical edge communications networks. Solutions are to be delivered at a technology readiness level (TRL) suitable for transition (nominally requiring a TRL of 6) to acquisition POR (Programs of Record). Prior to transition of the technology and products developed here, the capability will first be evaluated via a fleet-lead government-coordinated experimentation process. The challenge is to develop innovative solutions that are sufficiently robust to provide to the warfighter. Potential transition programs include, but are not limited to, E-2D, F/A-18G, F-35, unmanned systems, multiple aircraft via wing or mounted pods, Multiple Ship and special operating forces (SOF) applications, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), US Army, USMC and related programs.</p>
<p>In order to maximize the usefulness and availability of the solutions and technology developed under this BAA, preference will be given to the development/maturation of systems conforming to open standards. Also, solutions that do not utilize developers' proprietary toolkits or interfaces are preferred. The government may issue invitations to give oral presentations based on evaluation of the received proposals. Proposers are encouraged to review current and recent BAAs to gain insight into related technologies, platforms and programs listed in this BAA.</p>

<p>The FedBizOpps staff is not authorized to determine the classification code for any FedBizOpps notice. Because a misclassified contract action fails to notify the firms most likely to respond and therefore may violate the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), the contracting officer is held responsible for correctly classifying a FedBizOpps notice. A misclassified contract action must be corrected and re-synopsized in the FedBizOpps. Detailed classification codes are available on the FedBizOpps website at: http://FedBizOpps.gov/.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE:  Weir and Hydraulic Structures Canton Lake Dam, Blaine County, OK.  The purpose of this notice is to provide details of the project prior to advertisement of the package.  The Government is seeking the best proposals available.  To that end, this notice is to make prospective offerors aware of requirements for the proposal stage of acquisition. <br><br>Background:  <br>At Canton Lake, the Government is constructing an auxiliary spillway adjacent to the right abutment of the existing spillway.  This auxiliary spillway will be controlled by a weir and nine fuse gates.  This auxiliary spillway will be located in the auxiliary channel which is 480 feet wide and has been partially excavated up to the auxiliary spillway location to final channel grade.  Vertical diaphragm walls approximately 50 feet tall line the auxiliary channel.  The requirements below refer to the next phase of construction.  After completion of the below, the final phase will include further excavation to connect the new spillway to the reservoir.   <br><br>Requirement:<br>1.	Placement of a concrete weir (sill) approximately 35 feet deep by 70 feet long and spanning the 480 foot wide channel (approximately 40,000 cubic yards of concrete placement). <br>2.	Concrete water intake monolith approximately 40 feet tall with a 47 by 15 feet base; <br>3.	Concrete intake conduit approximately 11 feet square and 250 feet long.<br>4.	Concrete fusegates, nine each, approximately 30 feet tall and 50 feet wide.<br> <br>It is anticipated that the following services will be required: Structural and mass concrete placement requiring on-site batch plant, formwork, shoring of existing diaphragm walls, excavation, and de-watering.  <br><br>It is the Government's intent to advertise this requirement as a Best Value, trade-off Request for Proposal construction contract.  As part of the proposal submission there will be a requirement to submit a comprehensive shoring plan for the existing diaphragm walls.  The shoring of the existing diaphragm walls, excavation and subsequent weir construction presents a unique constructability challenges.  Offerors should be aware that they will be required to shore the soil beneath the walls during excavation.  In addition, the contractor will be responsible for maintaining the structural stability of the walls during the excavation process for both the weir and the conduit.  The interactions between the diaphragm wall and soil during phases of excavation are complex and significant analysis will be required. <br><br>Potential solutions may include but are not limited to:  additional anchoring of the existing diaphragm walls, new secant pile or diaphragm wall below (or overlapping) the existing diaphragm walls, piles driven at the edge of the conduit excavation, etc.  The Government is looking for contractor expertise and innovation in this area.  <br><br>Attachments to this notice illustrate the final configuration of project features.  There are aerial photographs of the site as of January 2011. These attachments to do not constitute final drawings and are for information only.   The photographs are intended to orient offerors to the site. Offerors should consider only information given in the RFP package when proposing. <br><br>The magnitude of this project's price is estimated between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.

<p>Scope of Project<br />This initiative contains DLA managed NSNs in Federal Supply Groups (FSGs) 3110/3120/3130.</p>
<p>&bull; FSG 3110-Roller Bearings (Unmounted)</p>
<p>&bull; FSG 3120-Bushings</p>
<p>&bull; FSG 3130-Roller Bearings (Mounted)</p>
<p>Anticipated Scope:<br />-Delivery of items to DLA depots or directly to DLA's customers in accordance with delivery terms.<br />-Collaboration with DLA on projected and anticipated demands<br />-Procurement/Purchasing-All actions related to acquisition planning, solicitation, evaluation, negotiations, contract award, contract administration, and contract management functions. Responsible for all subcontracts.<br />-Data management-to include interoperability with industry and government systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RFI Questions</p>
<p>General:<br />1) In regards to the identified NSNs, can you support both DLA Direct (DLA stocked) and Customer Direct (DLA direct) requirements?</p>
<p>2) If your company is a distributor or integrator is your company fully able to support the requirements of FAR 15.402 providing certifiable cost data not only at the first tier level but the second tier level as well (Timken cost data)?</p>
<p><br />3) If your company is a distributor or integrator, can you explain what value added elements your company will provide to the Government?<br />Packaging/Marking Requirements:</p>
<p>1) Do you repackage items as a part of your supplier function?</p>
<p>2) Are you familiar with and can you comply with military packaging requirement for both roller bearings and bushings? (Some roller bearings require clean room packaging-Mil Detail 197)</p>
<p>3) Are you familiar with and can you comply with military product marking requirements?</p>
<p>Data Management:</p>
<p>1) What type of data systems do you currently utilize and do you see any concerns with integrating your IT systems with other industry partners and Government agencies?</p>
<p>2) Can you process electronic transmissions?</p>
<p>Sources of Supply:</p>
<p>1) What type of Roller Bearing/Bushing products do you regularly supply? Are all FSGs identified aligned with your product mix? If not, is the list broader or narrower than the items you support?</p>
<p>2) Please identify whether your company is a manufacturer, non-manufacturer, or other?</p>
<p>3) DLA is required to purchase roller bearings as a domestic product. Per DFARs 252.225-7016, the cost of the bearing components (bearing element, retainer, inner race, or outer race) mined, produced or manufactured in the United States, its outlying areas, or Canada must exceed 50% of the total cost of the bearing components of that ball or roller bearing. What method would you use to actively identify and notify DLA of items that change from domestic to foreign and back?</p>
<p>4) What method would you utilize to reduce the number of foreign bearings and to increase the purchase of domestic bearings?</p>
<p>5) How do you recommend managing Critical Safety Items/First Article Testing items/Product Verification Testing items/Production Lot Testing items in a Long Term Agreement?</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to conduct a procurement with other than full and open competition, under FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to award a GSA Sole Source Delivery Order to Shape Technologie LLC, 1880 Office Club Pt, Colorado Springs, CO 80920, for technical engineering support and exercise scenario generation support for the Modeling and Simulation Branch of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and US Northern Command. This requirement is for continuing support to the Government by providing Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) simulation media and other services. This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers. A Sources Sought was issued and several potential contractors expressed their capability to meet the Government's needs but failed in many areas of the technical evaluation factors. It is determined that no other company has software that models/simulates the ITW/AA system, ground and space sensors, and the various entities that would be detected and tracked by ITW/AA; therefore, Shape Technologies Inc. is the only vendor that can meet our requirement.

<DESC>This is a reposting of the Notice posted April 27, 2011, for administrative reasons.<br /><br />W.L. Pritchard &amp; Co., L.C. (WLPCO) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) as a means of conducting market research to identify industry recommendations for means to obtain satellite-based broadband communications services between the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station located at the geographic South Pole (90&deg;S latitude) and the continental United States. <br />WLPCO presently provides support to the National Science Foundation (NSF), an Executive Branch independent agency of the United States Government. On behalf of the NSF, WLPCO is seeking information on approaches to meet the Government's long term broadband communications needs anticipated for U.S. Antarctic Program science research and mission operations conducted at or near Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station during the 2017-2030+ time frame.<br /><br />NSF will use information received as part of its strategic planning efforts to identify and characterize a range of communication services options for supporting U.S. activities in Antarctica.<br /><br />Of particular interest are commercial approaches that would allow the NSF to enter into a long term lease of communications services from a service provider. Approaches that leverage other prospective government and/or private sector interests to buttress a business case for construction/launch of new resources are also of interest.<br /><br />This RFI provides a broad statement of the Government's needs and seeks industry suggested approaches to satisfy those needs and provide insight into the associated technology and risk.<br /><br />Responses to this RFI will be treated as information only and will be considered as part of the Government's market research efforts.<br /><br />Background:<br />The National Science Foundation funds and manages the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP). Refer to http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/sitemap.jsp for information on the Office of Polar Programs, and http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/support/stations.jsp for information on research stations in Antarctica. Refer to http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/livingsouthpole/station_new.jsp for information on South Pole Station.<br /><br />Description of Services:<br />South Pole Station is the only NSF research station in Antarctica that cannot be served by conventional North-South station-kept geostationary satellites. It is beyond the coverage of geostationary satellites with less than nine degrees inclination. The station currently accesses GOES-3 (launched in 1978), and NASA TDRS F4, F5 and F6. Given the orbit characteristics of these satellites, communications capability at present is not full-time. The station also uses Iridium service to provide thin network coverage during daily gaps in broadband services provided by GOES and TDRS. Additional information about current South Pole Station satellite communications may be found here: http://www.usap.gov/usapgov/technology/contentHandler.cfm?id=1935<br /><br />A summary of NSF communications mission needs in support of USAP operations can be found in the file "Attachment 1 - USAP Satellite Communications Mission Needs." This document summarizes the full scope of anticipated communications across the entire Antarctic region, segregated by geographic regions of interest. Each region is given a relative ranking to discriminate in the relative level of emphasis. This depiction is provided to assist communications planners with evaluating the potential for a single space-based solution meeting a broader suite of mission needs than South Pole only, while providing a basis for making trade-offs in capability v. cost and complexity. However, approaches that do not provide some South Pole service are not of direct interest.<br /><br />Information Requested:<br />To maximize the Government's understanding, respondents should consider the information requested in the list appended to this RFI, titled "Attachment 2 - South Pole Broadband RFI Information Needs."<br /><br />Submission of Responses:<br />Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI in Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Power Point)&reg; as the preferred format. RFI responses are limited to a maximum of 20 pages, including cover and administrative pages. Responses may contain a mixture of text, numerical data, figures or graphics. CD-ROM submissions are requested in lieu of printed materials.<br /><br />Responses are to be submitted to W.L. Pritchard &amp; Co. L.C. at the address noted below.
<p>Management of Information:<br />Submissions that voluntarily contain proprietary information will be managed in accord with FAR 9.505-4, "Obtaining access to proprietary information".<br /><br />Any proprietary information submitted in response to this RFI must be clearly identified via a general declaration on the cover page and on any subsequent page where proprietary information occurs. The Government intends to utilize contractor resources to prepare analytical studies and digests utilizing submissions to the RFI for future planning efforts. Respondents who will require a Proprietary Data Protection Agreement (PDPA) should submit a draft of the necessary permissions protocol prior to submitting any proprietary information. The PDPA will not be counted towards the maximum RFI page count. Any information submitted that is not protected via PDPA shall be subject to full disclosure/release.<br /><br />Please be advised that submissions will not be returned.<br /><br />The support contractors listed below will be reviewing responses to this RFI. It is the respondent's responsibility to execute PDPA with these support contractors, if deemed necessary, by the date of your submission. All correspondence regarding the execution of a PDPA must be directed to the support contractors below.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) intends to execute a modification to add additional funds to an existing contract on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) awarded to Ingenix on September 22, 2005 competitive basis.
<p>The purpose of this follow-on work is a continuation of the work conducted under the 2005 multiple award contracts entitled, "The Epidemiologic Studies of Adverse Effects of Marketed Drugs" with Ingenix (HHSF223200510006C). The purpose of this work is to evaluate a drug product deemed to have in effect an approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug. FDA is interested in determining whether the conditions of safe use are being met.</p>
<p>To evaluate adherence to the risk management program process elements, FDA funded Phase I of a descriptive study to Ingenix to (1) describe and characterize patient use of the drug and a comparator and (2) to describe important patient events in the short time following program initiation (e.g. repeat hospitalization, mortality).</p>
<p>This contractor conducted Phase I of the descriptive study, consisting of an analysis of outpatient use of the drug and comparator. During this initial phase of the study, the contractor completed the outpatient analysis and submitted outpatient descriptive analysis tables.</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to conduct a follow-on study, Phase II of the descriptive study. The proposed work will use the data from Phase I of the descriptive study and link the outpatient data from the Phase I outpatient descriptive study with inpatient data. This linkage would enable completion of Phase II of the evaluation of the risk management program. FDA will leverage Ingenix's capability to link Ingenix's outpatient data with inpatient data from Premier. Premier inpatient data are cross-matched to the i3/Ingenix Invision Datamart outpatient data.</p>
<p>Ingenix is uniquely qualified to collaborate and conduct the follow-on study and perform analyses of data in that they 1) conducted the outpatient descriptive analysis and hold the data from this analysis; 2) the results from Phase I of the study are proprietary and no other source has completed this portion of the study; 3) using another contractor would be cost prohibitive as Phase I portion of the work would need to be performed again; 4) they have a unique and established relationship with Premier and the capability to link Ingenix's outpatient data from Phase I of the study with inpatient hospital data from Premier; and 5) that they have the expertise required since they participated in Phase I of the study awarded in the 2005 contract, "The Epidemiologic Studies of Adverse Effects of Marketed Drugs."</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals. No Solicitations will be issued. However, sources interested in this requirement must provide statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirement of this synopsis can be met. A determination by the Government to compete this procurement based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A modification to the contract will be executed on or after May 13, 2011.</p>

Participation bynon-U.S. organizations is welcome but may be subject to NASAs policy of no exchange offunds, in which each government supports its own national participants and associatedcosts.This partnership opportunity is being issued to select partners for preparing theproposal for development of a hybrid Doppler lidar payload to be hosted on theInternational Space Station (ISS) in calendar year 2017, operating for a minimum of 2years.	Options for extended operations until payload end-of-life are requested. NASA GSFC is seeking potential partners having demonstrated experience supporting thefollowing mission elements throughout the system life cycle (Phases A through E):- Hybrid Doppler lidar technologies and sub-systems including:	- solid state lasers at 355 nm and 2054 nm; 	- molecular and aerosol Doppler lidar receivers and technologies;	- scanning telescopes or arrays capable of addressing at least two (2)  orthogonal azimuth angles (fore and aft or ram and wake) at a	     fixed nadir angle in the range of 30 to 45 deg)		   - Alternatively, complete integrated hybrid Doppler lidar instrument payloads that meetthe science measurement requirements will also be considered - System Engineering support to resolve payload accommodation issues and system levelintegration and test (I & T)- Payload integration on the transfer vehicle- Environmental Test Program of the fully integrated payload- Mission operations support throughout the mission lifetime- Ground data capture and distribution services options- Payload measurement validation and verification- Modeling of instrument performance and simulation of atmospheric wind   observations in globally representative atmospheric conditionsPotential partners shall identify the mission area(s) in which they would propose topartner and provide a brief summary of how they intend to accomplish the mission elementsas identified above. In the event a teaming arrangement is proposed, an appropriatebreakout is required to ensure NASA understands how all mission elements are satisfied.The hybrid Doppler lidar payload is an Earth viewing, active optical system, focused onobserving the vertical structure of the horizontal wind field in the troposphere andlower stratosphere (altitudes from 0 to 25 km).  The hybrid lidar concept consists of aDoppler lidar subsystem utilizing primarily molecular backscattered signals for the windmeasurement in the clear air regions of the troposphere and a complementary subsystemmeasuring aerosol backscattered winds when sufficient aerosols and clouds are present. It is currently envisioned that the molecular channel would use direct detectiontechniques and technologies (lasers, interferometers or alternative spectraldiscriminators, detectors) operating in the ultraviolet wavelength region while theaerosol channel would utilize coherent detection techniques and technologies (laser,tunable local oscillator, detectors) in the near infrared.  Alternative solutions may beproposed for consideration.  The science payload requirements are listed below:Mission Duration -			2 years (2017-2018) ISS Orbit -			~350 to 400 km; 51.6 deg inclination Payload Mass -			&lt;500 kg Payload Power - 		&lt; 3kW Volume (LxWxH)- 	Not to Exceed 1850x800x1000 mm Lasers -				Direct detection Laser: =355 nm; Average Power @355 nm = 35 W (e.g. E=0.35J @ prf =100 pps);  minimum pulse energy Emin= 0.1 J/pulse(prf=3500 pps)				Coherent Laser: =2054 nm; E= 0.25 J/pulse; prf=10 ppsIf selected through this synopsis, it is expected that the selected partner(s) will workwith NASA scientists and engineers to jointly develop the proposal.  If the proposal isselected, NASA anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the selectedpartner(s) for performance of the proposed elements.There will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners for the AO proposalcycle.	If the proposed mission is selected, limited funding will be available accordingto the budget developed during proposal preparation.  If the proposed mission is selectedfor flight, partner(s) will be funded according to the budget developed during the AOproposal phase.Partner selections will be made by NASA based on the listed criteria in the followingorder of importance:(1) Relevant Experience and Past Performance.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Control Service Company for heating ventilation and air conditioning software system technical support for the HVAC Automatic Logic Controls at 16 locations throughout the National Weather Service Central Region. This service is for a base year and four option years.
<p>A Sources Sought Notice was posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on April 19, 011 and closed on April 28, 2011. No responses were received</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this action is 541512.</p>
<p>A dedicated server is installed in the National Weather Service Central Region Headquarters web farm containing Automatic Logic Corporation software. Automated Logic Corporation requires the certified group of field offices provide factory authorized support for their products. Having any work performed by other than the certified vendor would violate all factory warranties for all systems and devices. The authorized Automatic Logic Field Office in the greater Kansas City area is Control Service Company.</p>
<p>It is cost prohibitive to procure a new server and new software installed at the National Weather Service as well as new equipment and software at the 16 locations throughout the National Weather Service Central Region. If this functionality were to be re-established through another vendor, the server current server would no longer be maintainable and a new server and software interface would need to be established. Based on the complicated control functionality of the individual office control systems and the number of monitoring points, this would predicate a significant expense to the Government. The additional cost required would be cost prohibitive and the action would interrupt the function of the mission critical HVAC systems until the new service could be established.</p>
<p>Services required:<br />&bull; Contractor shall provide unlimited Automated Logic Controls telephone support with internet connection to sites for Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM at no additional cost. After hour and weekend support shall be provided on an as needed basis with additional preferred pricing.<br />&bull; The contractor shall provide major software version upgrades, service packs, patches, hardware drivers and any other updates required to keep the Automated Logic System Software and Hardware up to date and current for the applicable Weather Forecast Offices. This shall include the cost of the software and provide for the personnel to update the system as required. Upgrades shall be accomplished at least once every other year. <br />&bull; The contractor shall backup the Automated Logic System files and databases to a local web server as well as transfer a copy off site for storage at their facility. Additionally, the contractor shall provide a removable media device attached to the local web server that the backups will be stored on for recovery purposes.<br />&bull; The contractor shall review alarm and system logs and provide a report on anything which is found to be abnormal or needing attention as well as a list of all updates and backups that were performed.<br />&bull; The contractor shall provide continual training for National Weather Service employees for working on Automated Logic controls. The training can be held in conjunction with people outside the National Weather Service and the training shall be offered at various times throughout the year. The location for this training shall be at the contractor's discretion, but it must be within the Kansas City metropolitan area and this training shall be at no additional cost. Training may also be at a location of the National Weather Service's choosing for an additional fee.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)
Date:  February 8, 2011                                                       PR Number: R8790110012
1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):
The service being procured is the oversight of a large and complex exhibit project for War in the Pacific National Historical Park on the island of Guam.  Exhibits will be installed in the T. Stell Newman Visitor Center which has housed temporary exhibits since its completed renovation several years ago.
The oversight of this particular exhibit project is estimated at $75,000.00. 
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale (Check one and explain below):
    X	Only one responsible source. 
______	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. ______ Other   _____________________________________________________ 
Explain:  
The design contract for the development of exhibits was let back in 2006 as part of a building renovation project. Designs for the traditional exhibit are complete along with conceptual designs for a wide range of complex multi-media elements. The task order for fabrication of all of the exhibits was awarded in September of 2010. 
The prime fabrication contractor, Color-Ad, Inc., is responsible for building the exhibits to meet the specifications of the design package.  The more complex aspect of this project involves final development of the multi-media elements, including a variety of films, interactive media stations, audio stations, digital slide shows and a battle map program.  These interactive exhibits will be created by two separate audiovisual firms, Northern Light Productions and Unified Field, subcontracted by Color-Ad.
This is not a typical exhibit fabrication contract where all aspects have been designed and will simply be built according to the design package. On the contrary, this contract involves a great deal of design development, content research, image sourcing and design coordination that must be thoughtfully and carefully interconnected to the more traditional design aspects, particularly with the Audiovisual component.  Moreover, working on Guam presents challenges no found elsewhere in the NPS that must be taken into account during the design and fabrication phases to ensure the exhibits are successfully built and installed, and to ensure the park is able to maintain them for years to come.
Daniel Quan, the designer that designed the traditional exhibits, has been involved with this project for over five years now and has a unique set of skills and qualifications that cannot be found in the open market with a traditional exhibit producer.  The design was completed through a task order under an IDIQ contract that has expired.  In order to retain Daniel Quan as the designer of record, his services will be procured through a sole source purchase order for the reasons listed below.
Daniel Quan:
"	Understands, more than any one currently on the project, the critical yet subtle relationship between the content in the traditional exhibits vs. the content needed for the multi-media elements."	Has been intimately involved in the project from the start and will provide continuity, clarity, and design direction for the multi-media elements to ensure compatibility with the traditional exhibits.  "	Has a near encyclopedic knowledge of the subject matter and knows of many hundreds of available resources and where to find them. "	Amassed a vast collection of media assets that could take many months to explain to a new comer."	Traveled to Guam on several dozen occasions and understands the geography, the isolation of the island, and the important role that plays in all aspects of the park story."	Facilitated several dozen meetings with park staff and stakeholders to discuss the exhibits' themes and content."	Has developed audiovisual media and can provide appropriate levels of artistic and design direction to the team that will supplement, not duplicate, the traditional exhibits."	Is a licensed architect and highly skilled in the oversight of both architectural and exhibit fabrication work.

 3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:
There are no sources with the unique qualifications to ensure the successful and timely completion of this important exhibit fabrication project.  The designer of record, Daniel Quan, must be retained as he is the only one who knows the design intent and is familiar with design aspects of the traditional exhibits that are not explicitly in the design.
4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

Therefore, in accordance with the above cited authority, the government intends to enter into negotiations with AFA Protective Systems within 15 days after publication of this notice. The term of this contract is a base year from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012 with up to four one-year options to extend the terms and conditions through May 31, 2016.  It is anticipated that the option years will be awarded to AFA Protective Systems without further notice pending satisfactory performance and availability of funds.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses of this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT<br /><br />The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) intends to award a sole source, fixed price contract with Maiden Rock Communications (MRC), LLC, located at 586 Double Arrow Road, Seely Lake, MT 59868, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 6.302-1(a) (B) (iii) (b) (2), Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The purpose of this award is to modify the existing radio processor and to supply the next generation communications equipment for meteor burst master stations. The original meteor burst equipment was developed and maintained by Meteor Communications Corporation (MCC). MCC is the sole provider of the meteor burst technology and has granted a software license to Maiden Rock Communications to modify MCC's meteor burst equipment. <br />Over the past 30 years the NRCS SNOTEL and SCAN networks have operated on the meteor burst radio technology. SNOTEL is a mandated program by the US Congress. These projects range from helping to monitor and predict the snowmelt runoff and required reservoir storage to crop water uses for NRCS. The equipment requirement includes radios for remote station and radios and associated equipment at master stations. The equipment at the master stations includes radios, transmitters, receivers, synthesizers, 520B meteor burst controller, RF switches, 545b transmitter, and associated software. Most of the equipment used at these master stations was designed and purchased over 20 years ago. Time and the elements have made it necessary to plan for the replacement of these components and the software that runs them. Current technology in components and software will require modification to both the components and software. The new components and software must be compatible to interface with existing MCC equipment that exists under proprietary licenses. This notice is not a request for proposals. No solicitation document is available. The NAICS code is 811213 and the business size is $5 million. Point of contact is James Lowe at 817.509.3520. <br />

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.<BR><BR>The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 (g) and with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The Solicitation number is: OPM10-11-Q-0001 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50 dated April 15, 2011.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541110, and the small business size standard is $7.0 million. This procurement is unrestricted, allowing both large and small business to submit quotations.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Planning and Policy Analysis (PPA) office provides planning and analysis support to the Director and the agency. The PPA provides the Director with reports, memos and other analyses to allow the assessment of trends and issues that affect OPM. A particular area of responsibility of the PPA is the analysis of policy options, legislative changes and trends that affect OPM's management of health and retirement benefits for Federal employees. To assure benefits provide maximum value and are secure the office will conduct actuarial analyses, as well as statistical tests using large data bases. PPA is comprised of the following subcomponents: (1) Actuary, (2) Policy Analysis, and (3) Survey Analysis.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for implementing certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Act incorporated the Indian Health Care Improvement Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2009 (IHCIREA) which amended and reauthorized the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). The newly reauthorized IHCIA allows certain Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations to purchase Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) and Federal Employee Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) coverage, rights and benefits for its employees. Eligible employees of urban Indian organizations and tribes or tribal organizations carrying out programs under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act are entitled to purchase coverage, rights, and benefits for their employees, so long as the necessary employee deductions and Tribal/Urban contributions are paid into the appropriate fund(s). The law allows tribes and tribal organizations to purchase coverage, but does not require it.</p>
<p>There are significant challenges in effectively addressing issues related to the implementation of this Act without an in-depth understanding of the special legal, cultural and technical issues involved when working with Tribes, Tribal organizations and urban Indian organizations.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, PPA requires a consultant to assist with the dialogue process with the tribes and tribal organizations. The ultimate goal is to ensure all eligible tribes and tribal organizations have an opportunity to provide input on the implementation of the new provisions in the law.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award one Firm-Fixed Price contract to the offeror that represents the best value to the government. The period of performance shall be from date of award through September 30, 2011.</p>
<p>Offerors are invited to submit their quotations to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Contracting Group in response to this notice by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), May 6, 2011. Quotations submitted in response to this notice shall include the solicitation number in the subject line and be signed, dated and submitted via email to John.Dismond@opm.gov.</p>
<p>Only e-mailed requests for additional information will be accepted at john.dismond@opm.gov through 4:00 PM, EST, May 3, 2011. Note that communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition and result in the cancellation of the requirement.</p>
<p>Vendors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and not registered in the VETS-100 database at the time the requirement is to be awarded will not be considered. Vendors may register with CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or (269) 961-5757, or by accessing www.ccr.gov. Vendors may register with VETS-100 by accessing https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/.</p>

<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Division of Applied Pharmacology requires a Color Cell Sorter Flow Cytometer. This system will be designed to utilize biomarkers of infection with influenza as a measure of drug efficacy. One aspect of this project is cellular biomarkers, especially leukocyte populations. It is important to be able to accurately identify the responding populations and to isolate them for further in vitro functional characterization. In addition, this instrument will support additional projects in the division including viral-reactivation methods development and development of a mouse model with a humanized immune system.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Requirements <br /></strong>1. The instrument must be a newly manufactured unit, not used and refurbished or previously used for demonstration.</p>

<DESC><strong>******** &nbsp;This RFP is&nbsp;in<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> DRAFT</span> form. An amendment will be issued shortly stating when the RFP is FINAL. ***********<br /><br />Please see RFP attachments for further information. <br /><br />I. General Instructions</strong>
<p>1.0 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-48.</p>
<p>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a requirement for Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop managed services. This requirement is solicited as a Full and Open Competition and competed solely through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov).

<p>All vendors interested in submitting a proposal for consideration should do so, prior to the solicitation closing date, in the form of an email to the point of contact listed in this solicitation. All submissions should be in accordance with the stipulations set forth below:</p>
<p>1.1 The proposal shall be clear and concise and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation. The Offeror should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements. The Offeror should assume the Government has no prior knowledge of its capabilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's proposal.</p>
<p>1.2 Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed artwork, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired.</p>
<p>1.3 The proposal packages must be received on the date and time specified in Block 8 on Page 1 of this RFP. Submissions should not contain attachments greater then 5MB in size. Such submissions may be excluded. Proposals shall be submitted to Scott Stallsmith at scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than May 31, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time.</p>
<p>1.4 Proposals submitted after the time and date specified for receipt of the RFP will be considered LATE in accordance with FAR 52.215-1 (JAN 2004), Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition.</p>
<p>1.5 Written requests for clarification may be sent to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at the title of the e-mail must include "URHD QUESTION". The content of a question may be included in a notification or answer to all Offerors, but if so included will not divulge the source of the question.

All questions need to be submitted to scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than May 25, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time.</p>
<p>1.6 Small Business Subcontracting Plan</p>
<p>Each Large Business Offeror shall provide a Small Business Subcontracting Plan that contains all the elements required by FAR 52.219-9 Alt III (July 2010). This plan shall be submitted separately from the Small Business Participation Approach information required below, which applies to both large and small businesses. An approved Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not a requirement for evaluation in source selection, but rather a requirement for award to a large business and will be incorporated into any resultant contract.</p>
<p>1.7 Proposal shall be based on open market pricing.</p>
<p>1.8 The government will make award based on a Best Value Trade-off analysis on the submitted proposals.</p>
<p>1.9 All offerors must either be registered on the ORCA website or submit a completed version of the Offeror Representations and Certifications (please see Section 6.0 of this RFP).</p>
<p><br /><strong>II. General Information</strong></p>
<p>1.0 Prospective offerors are cautioned against contacting other Government personnel in regard to this solicitation prior to award. Prospective Offerors are also cautioned to advise potential subcontractors or teaming contractors of this instruction. If such contact occurs and is found too prejudicial to competing Offerors, the Offeror (including subcontractors or teaming partners) making such contact may be excluded from award consideration. Only responses from the Contracting Officer in writing shall be considered for purposes of this procurement.</p>
<p>The Government will use the data and information gathered in the course of this pilot to determine the feasibility of SaaS, Computing to Go Service Models, and Public/Private Cloud Computing for NGA. If this proof of concept is successful, NGA intends to procure these services agency-wide through a competitive acquisition. As such, pursuant to DFARS 227.7202-1(c)(1), the Service Provider is required to provide deliverables detailing changes to or within the Government's hardware and software systems with Government Purpose Rights, as defined in DFARS Clause 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014. This will enable NGA to provide potential vendors in the follow-on competitive procurement with the information necessary for modifying the Government system to enable these services through any commercial vendor.</p>
<p>If the Service Provider wishes to assert more restrictive rights than Government Purpose Rights in any deliverable or part thereof, it shall do so in accordance with DFARS Clause 252.227-7017. Any Government requests to validate asserted restrictions will be done in accordance with the procedures in DFARS Clause 252.227-7019.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Special Notice - Special Use of Contractor Support </strong></p>
<p>a. The Government will use MITRE personnel for administrative, technical, and price analysis support during source selection. The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government. Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C. 423) (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") as implemented in the FAR. MITRE personnel are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information. Contractor personnel assisting in the proposal evaluation are procurement officials within the meaning of the Act, and will take all necessary action to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a competing Contractor's proprietary data. Non-Disclosure and Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificates for all contractor support personnel participating in this source selection are on file at the respective contracting activities.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.0 Restrictions of Briefings </strong></p>
<p>During the period of source selection, which begins with release of this Request for Proposal (RFP) and ends with contract award, briefings by potential Offerors to Government agencies on the subject matter of this RFP are inappropriate. Conducting such a briefing without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer may be justification for eliminating your company from further consideration under this RFP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ITEMS and ITEMS - Pilots Background Information<br /></span><br /></strong>NGA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency that provides Geospatial-Intelligence to both the DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC). NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate Geospatial-Intelligence in support of National Security. The Director of NGA is the functional manager for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG), which is the combination of people, technology, policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities and community necessary to produce Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) in an integrated multi-intelligence environment to support National Security Strategy objectives.</p>
<p>NGA is looking to change how the agency procures and provisions Information Technology in order to meet expanding mission requirements given budgetary constraints. NGA plans on implementing a managed services model that decreases complexity, increases agility, enhances reliability, while improving efficiency and effectiveness of IT delivery in support of the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). NGA intends to implement these services under the consolidated Information Technology Enterprise Managed Services (ITEMS) program. In order to position the agency for successful implementation of this program, NGA is currently executing risk reduction activities and intends to award several pilots as part of these activities. The purpose of the pilot activities is to explore commercially available technologies for application in NGA facilities as well as external sites. The four pilots being contemplated are Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop (URHD) pilot, Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot, User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot, and Deployed Services (DS) pilot.</p>
<p>The URHD pilot will explore the use of a commercial Cloud as an alternative to in-house solutions. The outcome of this pilot is to determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity at a commodity price; free up one-third of data center floor space for other uses; flatten recapitalization spikes; provide efficiencies that will free up other IT resources for repurposing toward mission; and provide 24 x 7 access to voice, email, data and cloud applications via Personal Information Technology Devices (PITDs), Smart Phones, etc. NGA expects that the pilot will drive out policy concerns and solutions.</p>
<p>The Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot will explore a flexible, on-demand alternative to standard government owned data centers. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity to provide parallel operations that allows thin client transition; parallel dissemination operations; on-demand flexible capacity to allow rapid provisioning of it services; and benefit from the elimination of expensive facility modifications in limited data center space.</p>
<p>The User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot will explore flexible, on-demand alternatives to government owned user-facing hardware. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: eliminate need for multiple thin-clients at the desktop; modern, flexible, user-facing hardware; replacement or augmentation of voice and video services; and implementation of mobile thin-client devices.</p>
<p>The Deployed Services (DS) pilot will explore flexible, cross-security domain collaboration capabilities. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: deployed personnel collaboration capability for use by deployed personnel in crisis; CONUS and OCONUS situations; and a deployed PITD capability, regardless of whether an existing cell phone network exists.</p>
<p>These four pilots form an integrated architecture that mirrors the ITEMS operational objective architecture, albeit at a reduced capability and scope. By demonstrating this reduced architecture, NGA will gain high confidence in the feasibility of implementing the ITEMS approach, and detailed knowledge of how to structure the enterprise ITEMS acquisition.</p>

<p>This is a Combined Synopsis for Commercial Services prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This notice constitutes the only solicitation; a separate solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation NIHCL2011089 includes all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50 with amendments dated April 15, 2011. The acquisition will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements.</p>
<p>The standard North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 333993 and the size standard is 500 employees. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal and is a total small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The syringe filling machine will automatically and aseptically fill various sizes of syringes with sterile solutions manufactured by NIH/PDS, to be used in vaccine formulations, in products used for bone marrow sampling and for similar projects that will come in the future. This bench-top aseptic syringe filling machine will avoid the need for manually handling the syringes (filling and placing a stopper on the end of the barrel) and greatly decrease the likelihood of contamination. Placing the stopper on the syringe barrel requires a machine with a vacuum system. The machine must be portable and compact enough to fit in a 10 foot biological hood within the clean room. <br />The syringe filling machine will have the following specifications:<br />&#61558; Compact design manufactured with a 316 stainless steel frame to work in the limited space of our current laminar flow hood.<br />&#61558; Can be entirely steam sterilized.</p>
<p><br />&#61558; Easily assembled and broken down for cleaning and decontamination.<br />&#61558; Can be handled by 2 trained operators <br />&#61558; The module must automatically fill various types and sizes of syringes from the barrel side. <br />&#61558; The module has to place the stopper inside the barrel of syringes with or without needles.<br />&#61558; Fill Volumes must vary from 0.2 mL to 5 mL<br />&#61558; The syringe filling machine will have a pump module that fills the syringes with water like liquids with a plus or minus 2% accuracy.<br />&#61558; The machine will accept our medical grade silastic tubing, 1/8 X 1/4 in Helix Mark cat# 60-011-21 or equivalent.<br />&#61558; Programmable logic controls allowing manual or automatic dispensing.<br />&#61558; The module must have capabilities for gas purge of the syringes.<br />&#61558; The machine must have a vacuum system capable of inserting 100 stoppers at the same time aseptically when the syringes are in a nested configuration. This process will take less than 5 minutes.<br />&#61558; The module must fill at a rate of at least 400 syringes per hour.<br />&#61558; There should be no particulate matter formed or dispersed inside the syringe and class 100 aseptic hood from the operation of the syringe filling machine.</p>
<p>The module must fit our current horizontal biologic hood, Bldg 10, RM 1C166A7A2, which has a frontal opening with a Maximum Height of 3 ft, depth of 3 ft and length of 10 ft.</p>

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>The USDA - Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Georgia intends to award an order(s) to Small Business Sources capable of providing a Market Analysis, which is the market value of lands typically enrolling in the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP), based on a composite of comparable sales by land use within Market Groups set by a Real Estate Professional. A firm fixed price purchase order is planned as a result of this solicitation.
<p>(i)This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<p>(iv) This is a 100% small business set aside and the applicable NAICS code is 531320, Real Estate Appraisal Services, which has a size standard of $2 million (annual revenue). Only quotes from small businesses will be considered. A size standard is the largest that a concern can be and still qualify as a small business for Federal Government programs. Size standards are the average annual receipts of a firm. Method to calculate average annual receipts of a firm can be found in 13 CFR &sect; 121.104. For more information on these size standards, please visit http://www.sba.gov/size.</p>
<p>(v) Line Item Numbers. Pricing must be held for 30 calendar days after the due date for quotes listed in this notice to provide for adequate time to evaluate quotes and make award.

The quoted price schedule will be used to evaluate each offeror's price and to establish the rates to be used for any resultant<br />order(s).</p>
<p>Bids will be for a market analysis of the whole state of Georgia. It is expected that the real estate professional will set Market Groups that group counties together of like market values (for example, in FY 2010, Georgia had 9 Market Groups for all 159 counties).</p>
<p>(vi) Description of Requirements. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in estimating the fair market value of real estate. It is expected that the appraiser will investigate comparable sales and provide fair market value of lands that typically enroll in WRP and GRP and provide this information in a map form that has market groups of counties with similar values. Any tie quotes will be resolved using the procedures at FAR Part 14. <br />(vii) Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and Acceptance. The period of performance will end on June 29, 2011.

Solicitation No. DTRT57-11-Q-80074 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50. The NAICS Code is 423490 and the Small Business size standard is 100 employees. This sole source announcement constitutes the only solicitation. A written solicitation will not be issued.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK - (Begin)</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Excessive airport and aircraft noise produces stress and annoyance in local communities. National legislation, including the Aviation and Noise Abatement Act of 1978, addresses this problem by mandating the protection of the public's health and welfare through regulation of aircraft noise. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been charged with the responsibility of developing noise control regulations. In this effort, the FAA is compiling data on aircraft noise and assesses community sentiment concerning the noise control issue. The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) Acoustics Facility (VCAF) has supported the FAA's efforts by regularly measuring and analyzing aircraft noise.</p>
<p>Objective:</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to update and improve VCAF's field sound level measurement equipment. Its existing Larson-Davis (LD) sound level measurement systems require several system upgrades in order to meet VCAF's field functionality standards for several upcoming field measurements. These system upgrades will require a purchase of the LD part numbers listed in the "Parts to be delivered" section below.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>The part numbers listed in the "Parts to be delivered" table in Attachment A, purchased via this procurement and delivered to the Volpe Center will be brand-new parts, not used or refurbished.</p>
<p>Parts to be delivered:</p>
<p>See attachment A for Contract Line Items (CLINs) 0001 - 0013</p>
<p>Deliverables and Period of Performance:</p>
<p>All part numbers listed in the "Parts to be delivered" section in attachment A will be delivered to the Volpe Center within four weeks of date of award. All parts will be delivered to the following address:</p>
<p>Clay Reherman, RVT-41<br />Volpe National Transportation Systems Center<br />125 Munroe St.<br />Cambridge, MA 02142</p>
<p><br />Statement of Work - (End)</p>

<DESC>This solicitation is for the acquisition of a 175 ton press brake. The purchase specification&nbsp;is included as an attachment with this solicitation and it spells out all of the features and capabilities that we need. Furthermore,&nbsp;the purchase specification&nbsp;identifies who will be responsible for the various logistical items necessary to get the machine up and running. The using activity needs this machine to perform building repairs, HVAC work, etc. This request is a small business set aside. Hill AFB already owns Pacific brand dies so those are not needed as part of this acquisition since we will continue to use those dies.<br /><br />Please note that&nbsp;solicitation date has been expended.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;see the questions and answers and revised purchase specification attachments. There&nbsp;is another set of questions that have been asked and the answers will be posted next week. &nbsp;

NOTE:  Offerors will be afforded the opportunity to respond to any negative comments received during past performance evaluation except for those already addressed by the contractor (i.e. response to contract discrepancy notices, cure notices, show cause notices, etc).  An offeror showing no relevant past performance relating to this request for proposal will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably, but will receive an unknown risk rating.<br><br> 	4.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br>(End of provision)<br><br>ADDENDUM TO FAR Clause 52.212-2.  The following addendum is included and hereby made part of FAR Clause 52.212-2.<br><br>(a)  Basis for Award<br><br>     1.  The government will award a contract to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government considering price and technical factors stated in this RFP.  Failure to propose a price for all CLINs will render the proposal unacceptable and the proposal will be rejected.<br><br>     2.  Evaluation factors upon which award will be based, are set forth below.<br><br>(b)  Evaluation Approach<br><br>     1.  The Government will evaluate each proposal by employing the lowest price technically acceptable method.  The written proposal, in conjunction with the on-site evaluation, will be used to assess evaluation factor ratings.<br><br>     2.  All proposals will be subjected to an initial screening by the Contracting Officer to determine whether proposals are complete before being evaluated as detailed below.  Proposals that are considered substantively incomplete after initial screening shall be rejected and offerors will be notified they are no longer eligible for further consideration.  Offerors are advised that unsupported promises to comply with contractual requirements will not be sufficient.  Additionally, a proposal that is unreasonable or incomplete in terms of price will not be considered for award.<br><br>     3.  The Government intends to award without discussions.  Offerors shall ensure their initial proposal contains its best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary.  Discussions, if any, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.306 and final offers will be evaluated in the same manner and against the same criteria as were initial offers.<br><br>(c)  Evaluation Factors for Award.  Proposals submitted in response to the solicitation will be evaluated based upon the following factors:  Price, Past performance, and Mission Capability.  The Mission Capability and Past Performance factors are equal in importance and when combined are less important than the Price factor.  <br><br>1.  Mission Capability.  Under Mission Capability the following elements will be evaluated: Expert knowledge of JEFTS/ECS2 systems and the timeline for completion of tasks 1-7.  These elements will be evaluated together for acceptability in the Mission Capability area.  The Mission Capability factor will receive one of the following adjectival ratings:<br><br>	ACCEPTABLE  -  Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation (See Note below).<br><br>	UNACCEPTABLE  - Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br><br>NOTE:  Expert knowledge of JFETS/ECS2 systems will be a key factor in the selection consideration process. A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in this area will NOT be eligible for award.<br><br>	2.  Past Performance. Under Past Performance the following elements will be evaluated:  Experience working in JFETS/ECS2 environment.  The Past Performance Factor will receive one of the adjectival ratings:<br><br>ACCEPTABLE  -  Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown (See Note below). <br><br>	UNACCEPTABLE  - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br><br>NOTE:  No record of past performance will result in an acceptable rating.  Offerors shall submit only past performance relevant to the requirements set forth in this solicitation.  A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in this area will NOT be eligible for award.		<br><br>	3.  Price.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness IAW FAR 15.403-1(c)(1).  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal offers the lowest price, technically acceptable proposal.<br><br>52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT. The Government anticipates to award a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation.<br><br>(M.) The following provisions apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by full text: FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions IBR.  FAR 52.212-3 shall be completed by the offeror, and included in the proposal submission.<br><br>AMC AGENCY LEVEL PROTEST PROCEDURES<br><br>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concems with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concems within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<p>The SKUs listed are older but still accepted. Since they are the ones currently in use at NIST, CheckPoint will still use these SKUs to avoid having a mix of different licenses for the NIST Security team. Resellers have access to these SKUs if they ask CheckPoint for approval to quote them (Resellers should contact Bryce Bostrom at bbostrom@checkpoint.com or 703-371-4088 to get that approval).</p>

<DESC><p>2011 Air Force/Industry Nuclear Weapons Technology Interchange Workshop for Independent Research &amp; Development (IR&amp;D) and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Commercialization Pilot Program (CPP)<br />The Air Force Global Strike Command (GSC) in partnership with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (NWC), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and the AF Independent Research &amp; Development (IR&amp;D) Program Office will conduct an Air Force/Industry Nuclear Weapons Technology Interchange Workshop (TIW) on 2-3 Aug 2011 at Kirtland Air Force Base NM. This workshop is classified at the SECRET level and is limited to US Citizens. This is a Step 1 workshop within the AF IR&amp;D framework, during which the AF presents to Industry its current Science and Technology (S&amp;T) needs, solutions and gaps traceable to specific mission areas (in this case the nuclear enterprise). This invitation is open to DoD military, civilians, DoD technical support contractors, and Industry contractors that have a SECRET clearance, maintain a valid DD Form 2345 (Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement), and meet the requirements indicated in this announcement. Please note that Critical Nuclear Defense Weapon Information (CNDWI), Formally Restricted Data and Restricted Data is not to be presented.<br />This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the government in any way. Response to this request is voluntary and will not impact any future acquisitions. Please respond to the appropriate point of contact 60 days prior to the event with your intent to attend this workshop. Note that specific major contractor attendance criteria exist for both of the IR&amp;D and SBIR technical tracks.<br />The general format of this workshop is planned as follows:</p>
<p>1. On day one, a classified 8-hour plenary session is intended for presentation of four major topics:<br />a. The current nuclear weapons technology needs, as shown in the GSC S&amp;T Guidance, required to support the GSC capabilities; <br />b. NWC's approach to meeting their capabilities' needs; <br />c. AFRL's technology solutions approach to meeting those needs; and,<br />d. Address how industry can engage in filling technology gaps.<br />2. On day two, there will be two simultaneous events occurring relevant to the technical presentations of day one:</p>
<p>a. A classified IR&amp;D one-on-one Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) session between interested major defense contractors and AF nuclear enterprise subject matter experts. These AF team of experts will conduct private Q&amp;A sessions, approximately 20 minutes in duration, to afford major contractors an opportunity to ask technical questions and receive clarification of nuclear technology data presented during the classified plenary session. This opportunity is provided to major contractors only to help them prepare for the IR&amp;D Step 2 workshop that will subsequently follow about 4 months after the Step 1 workshop, tentatively scheduled for the week of 5 December 2011. In this Step 2 event, Industry presents relevant portions of their respective IR&amp;D portfolio germane to GSC's capability gaps addressed in Step 1.</p>
<p>b. Optional Small-Business Innovative Research Commercialization Pilot Program (SBIR-CPP) one-on-one sessions between prime contractors and small businesses are available on day two. These sessions focus on opportunities to discuss transition of specific SBIR projects to major contractors, to AFRL portfolios, and to AF programs of record. Please note that small business' attendance in this track is by invitation from prime contractors only.<br />Who Can Participate<br />The attending companies must:</p>
<p>1. If a major contractor, meet the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) 31.205-18(a)(iii) definition of a major contractor which states that a major contractor "means any contractor whose covered segments allocated a total of more than $11,000,000 in IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year...".</p>
<p>2. Meet the Defense Contracting Audit Agency (DCAA) criteria of major defense contractor (which essentially means any contractor that had $90 million or more in annual auditable costs for the prior fiscal year).</p>
<p>3. If a Small Business, be invited by a major contractor;</p>
<p>4. Maintain a valid DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. DD Form 2345 must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date of the event.</p>

<p>A. The IR&amp;D Process<br />This workshop is the first in a three-step IR&amp;D process that is executed to sustain an active dialogue on collaboration of technology solutions for the AF nuclear enterprise. <br />1. Step 1. <br />Step 1 includes a classified plenary session in which GSC, NWC, other product centers and AFRL will brief industry on:<br />a. The current nuclear weapons technology needs, as shown in the GSC S&amp;T Guidance, required to support the GSC capabilities; <br />b. NWC's approach to meeting their capabilities' needs; <br />c. AFRL's technology solutions approach to meeting those needs; and,<br />d. Address how industry can engage in filling technology gaps.</p>
<p>After the classified plenary session, the AF team will afford major defense contractors an optional opportunity to ask questions in a classified setting relevant to the topics briefed in the plenary session and their subsequent preparation to brief their IR&amp;D programs in the Step 2 event currently scheduled for the week of 5 December, 2011.<br />2. Step 2.<br />Step 2 follows in approximately four months from the execution of Step 1 and offers an opportunity for industry to present their IR&amp;D initiatives to the AF panel of nuclear technology experts, based on what they learned in the Step 1 workshop. Shortly following the Step 1 workshop, the AF IR&amp;D program office will provide major contractors specific and detailed instructions on how to prepare for the Step 2 workshop. <br />3. Step 3.<br />Step 3 is the period of assessment and alignment whereby the AF team considers specific and relevant IR&amp;D projects for budget planning, for mapping into its strategic plans, and for continuing the dialogue with industry on expediting potential partnerships and embarking on specific consortiums to meet technology needs.<br />B.

INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners. Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403). Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services. The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners. Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts. The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC. This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots. Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc) The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support. These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options. The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. Capabilities Package: All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009. The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00. We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions. Points of Contact: The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil. All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team. Do not provide proprietary information in your questions to the contracting officer since all questions and answers will be shared amongst all interested parties.

<DESC>INTRODUCTIONNASA is currently developing requirements for a U.S. Commercial Crew TransportationSystem (CTS) capability that will transport NASA and NASA-sponsored crew safely to andfrom Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and the International Space Station (ISS).  The scope of thiscommercial transportation capability involves designing, developing, and certifying anintegrated system including the launch vehicle, spacecraft, and associated groundinfrastructure to perform all aspects of a human spaceflight mission. The Commercial Crew Program (CCP) is planning to host a Requirements Workshop on May 24and 25, 2011 near the Kennedy Space Center, Florida.  An agenda and specific location forthe workshop will be available within 2 weeks.	On May 24, NASA will provide anintroduction to the CCPs requirement set, known as the CCT-1100 Series and discuss keyfeatures of each of the documents.  May 25 is reserved for individual, private sessionsbetween Industry companies and CCP representatives.  These exchanges are an opportunityfor Industry to ask specific questions and provide detailed feedback on the requirementswith respect to their concepts.  NASA is very interested in Industrys identification ofany unnecessary, overly burdensome, and/or overly prescriptive requirements.  NASA wouldalso like to know if the requirements suite provides enough detail to design, develop,produce, and operate the CTS and if any deficiencies are recognized.  Finally, duringone-on-one sessions, it would be helpful for the CCP to understand areas or specificrequirements that significantly impact the viability or are major cost drivers toIndustry design, development, and certification efforts.   COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM DOCUMENT SET  CCT-1100 SERIESAs part of the planning effort, NASAs CCP has developed the CCT-1100 Seriesdocumentation, to communicate roles and responsibilities, technical management processessupporting certification, crew transportation system and ISS services requirements, ISSinterface requirements, and the application of technical and operations standards forpotential Commercial Partners.	The Crew Transportation Plan (CCT-PLN-1100), defines theevaluation processes for investment performance, CTS Certification, and CTS FlightReadiness and works in conjunction with the other documents in the set that address thetop level CTS requirements and standards.  The Crew Transportation System DesignReference Missions Document (CCT-DRM-1110) summarizes the potential Design ReferenceMissions for the CTS although NASAs current focus is on transporting NASA Crew to andfrom the ISS.  The Crew Transportation Technical Management Processes (CCT-PLN-1120)provides a summary of the technical management processes that support the certificationeffort and CCPs expectations for evidence of compliance across the life cycle of theprogram leading to a certified service capability.  The ISS Crew TransportationCertification and Services Requirements Document (CCT-REQ-1130) and the ISS to CommercialOrbital Transportation Services Interface Requirements Document (SSP 50808) establishrequirements that must be met to achieve Crew Transportation System certification totransport NASA Crew and dock with or operate in the vicinity of the ISS.  NASAs CrewTransportation Technical Standards and Design Evaluation Criteria (CCT-STD-1140) andNASAs Crew Transportation Operations Standards (CCT-STD-1150) documents provideexpectations and criteria used by NASA to guide the development and evaluation of acertified CTS.NASAs overarching strategy for the development of these documents is to ensure therequirements meet NASA safety and performance standards, yet is not overly prescriptiveand allows Commercial Industry maximum flexibility to develop safe, reliable, and costeffective human space transportation systems.  REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPMENT BACKGROUNDIn May 2010, NASA released the first version of commercial human rating requirements toIndustry with a Request for Information (RFI NNH10ZTT005L) in a document titled,Commercial Human Rating Plan (CHRP).	NASA used the extensive and valuable feedbackalong with NASAs refined understanding and planning into the preparation of the CCT-1100Series documentation set.  In addition, in December of 2010, NASAs Exploration SystemsMission Directorate released requirements in a document titled Commercial CrewTransportation System Certification Requirements for Low Earth Orbit Missions.  Thisdocument is applicable to any NASA Program certifying commercial crew transportationsystems to carry NASA/NASA-sponsored Crew to LEO. Initial drafts of the CCT-REQ-1130 and CCT-STD-1140 documents were completed in October2010, and released with the Commercial Crew Development Round 2 (CCDev2) solicitation. After the CCDev2 solicitation release, the CCT-1100 Series documentation continuedinternal development and review.  While there is still significant forward work, the mostcurrent draft version of the document set has been approved for release.  It should benoted that some of the updates were organizational in nature.  For example, some of theprogrammatic processes that resided in CCT-REQ-1130 and CCT-STD-1140 now are captured inCCT-PLN-1120; and CCT-REQ-1130 has been reorganized for clarification.	Additionally,there were some requirements in 1130 that have been changed, added, or eliminated.  It isimportant to review the entire suite of documents to ensure a full understanding of themost current requirements, process, and standards expectations.REQUIREMENT SET, CCT-1100 SERIES RELEASE PLANIn order to expedite the release of the document set, the CCP is releasing CCT-REQ-1130and CCT-STD-1140 with this synopsis.  The remaining portion of the CCT-1100 Series willbe released next week. SUMMARYCCP requests and encourages the Commercial Spaceflight Industry to review the entiresuite of documents for information and in preparation for participation in theRequirements Workshop on May 24 and 25, 2011.  At the workshop, CCP representatives willbe available to answer questions and receive feedback on the CCT-1100 Seriesdocumentation.	Further clarifications on this synopsis or the Requirements Workshop canbe requested by contacting Tammy Burlein by phone 321.867.3484 or by emailtammy.s.burlein@nasa.gov.

AMENDMENT 0001

This amendment is issued to notify all interested parties that this anticipated procurement effort is canceled in its entirety effective immediately.
 

ORIGINAL

The Government intends to procure Barrel Coating on a full-and-open competition basis by awarding to the responsible Offeror whose offer presents the best value to the Government considering technical, past performance, and price related factors.  This will be a competitive, non-commercial procurement in accordance with FAR Part 15 and will result in a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) three-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.

This effort will procure the application of a Barrel Coating to extend rifle barrel life and include a visual wear indicator.  The treated barrels shall be used in support of precision and automatic weapons requirements for the Department of Defense on the MK13 and MK15 Sniper Rifle Systems and the M2HB .50cal Machine Gun.
  The goal is to provide the most precise, durable, reliable, and effective barrels possible by reducing down time of the weapons for barrel replacement and therefore reducing overall O&M costs.  The Government contemplates providing a quantity of barrels as GFM to the awardee in order to accomplish the preproduction portion of this procurement effort.  Upon the successful completion of preproduction units, the Government may then choose to procure production quantities as required.

The awardee will receive orders for a minimum value of $25,000.00.  The potential maximum contract value is $2,000,000.00.  All items shall be produced in accordance with the associated Statement of Work and CDRLs attached to the forthcoming solicitation.
  The delivery requirements will be negotiated through discussions prior to contract award.  Delivery requirements shall be F.O.B. Destination; inspection and acceptance occur at the destination.

The solicitation attachments will be posted to the FBO website concurrently with the solicitation.  The Offeror must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive the solicitation attachments.  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the internet at www.ccr.gov.  In accordance with FAR 4.1201, the Offeror shall also complete electronic annual representations and certifications via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the CCR database.

All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date of the solicitation will be posted to the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and NECO as amendments issued to the solicitation.
  For changes made after the closing date, only those Offerors that submitted a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed; interested sources must download the document from the websites names above.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered.

The Government point of contact is Mr. Matthew S. Summers, Code CXMLNL at telephone number 812-854-8756, facsimile number 812-854-5095 or e-mail matthew.s.summers@navy.mil.  Complete mailing address is:  Mr. Matthew S. Summers, Code CXMLNL, Bldg. 3422, NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5001.
  Reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.

Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within
the scope of the classifications listed may be added after
award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses
(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).

----------------------------------------------------------------

In the listing above, the "SU" designation means that rates
listed under the identifier do not reflect collectively
bargained wage and fringe benefit rates.  Other designations
indicate unions whose rates have been determined to be
prevailing.

----------------------------------------------------------------

                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

================================================================

Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within
the scope of the classifications listed may be added after
award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses
(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).

----------------------------------------------------------------

In the listing above, the "SU" designation means that rates
listed under the identifier do not reflect collectively
bargained wage and fringe benefit rates.  Other designations
indicate unions whose rates have been determined to be
prevailing.

----------------------------------------------------------------

                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, repair parts, tools, and equipment to repair and restore the masonry building exterior, roof systems, limited interior repairs, window glazing, XL piping, and below grade waterproofing at the Edward T. Gignoux Courthouse, Portland, Maine. The Courthouse was built in 1911 with a major addition constructed in 1931 in the Italian Renaissance Revival styles. All work is required to comply with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Primary work items will include masonry repointing, restoration and cleaning, window restoration and reglazing, removal/reinstallation of the existing slate roof system and installation of a new copper perimeter roof system, restoration of window and door sealants, and salvaging of exterior stairs. Provisions for upgrading the existing window glazing with laminated insulated glazing, limited replacement of the current non-compliant XL sprinkler piping and courtyard waterproofing will be addressed as bid options. Work shall also include limited historical lime plaster interior restoration and paint finishes. <br /><br /><br />
<p align="left">The work for all Base Bid Work and Bid Options shall be sequenced in accordance with the approved schedule by the US Courts, US Marshalls, and GSA in order to provide for the safety, security, temporary parking, utility services, and mission critical functions required by the building occupants during the work of this contract. The work shall be sequenced as indicated. Continued Government operations of the US Courts and Marshals Service shall be maintained without exception. Phasing and careful contractor coordination will be required as the building will be fully occupied during the proposed renovation. The contractor shall also be required to maintain the integrity of the existing building security, secure construction staging and avoid any procedures which would compromise the building's security perimeter.</p>
<p><br />Performance period is 690 calendar days after the receipt of the notice to proceed and this will be a firm fixed price contract. This is a best value competitive negotiated procurement set-aside for small business concerns; offers from large businesses will not be considered. NAICS is 236220 with a size standard of $33.5 million.</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit both written technical and price proposals. Offers will be evaluated on technical capability and price, with technical quality being approximately equal to price. Evaluation Factors are: (1) Proven past performance in providing general construction services in historic renovation, restoration and reproduction on projects of similar size. (2) Qualifications and experience of key personnel. (3) Management Plan and Technical Approach. (4) Proven plan to procure, and manage eight (8) technically qualified Specialty Sub-contractors listed in the Contract Specifications. The estimated cost range for this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. A bid guarantee is required and the offerors must provide evidence that they can provide Performance and Payment Bonds after award.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference will be conducted by GSA on Tuesday, May 17, 2011 at 10:00 AM. Contractors shall meet at the Edward T. Gignoux Federal Courthouse, 156 Federal Street, Portland, Maine at 9:30 AM. The Government considers attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive offer as it will enable the Contractor to become acquainted with the work areas and that it is more advantageous for each Offeror to have qualified representation at the pre-proposal conference. As Offerors may not be able to re-enter buildings after the tour, and cameras are not allowed on federal property, all Offerors are cautioned to see all areas as they deem necessary during the tour, in order to augment their ability to submit an informed proposal. Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions or miscalculations in offers. No questions can be answered during the tour therefore; all questions need to be submitted in writing to the contracting officer. While the conference will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify the solicitation provisions, any information received at the pre-proposal is not official or binding and nothing said or represented in the conference will be deemed to modify the solicitation requirements unless followed by a written amendment.</p>
<p>The solicitation, agreement, specifications, drawings and other applicable documents&nbsp;will be&nbsp;available for electronic download at no charge from the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov on May 11, 2011. No other notifications will be sent. No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued, and telephone, fax, or email requests for this solicitation will not be accepted. Contract Award is Subject to the Availability of Funds.</p>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, New York District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the Operational Readiness Training Complex (ORTC) project, Fort Drum, NY (Jefferson County). The estimated range is between $25,000,000 and $50,000,000. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br /><br />Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br /><br /><br /><br />(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in Jefferson County (Fort Drum), NY? <br /><br />(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br /><br />(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br /><br />(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br /><br />(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br /><br />(6) What is the cost impact to the bid/proposal due to a PLA?<br /><br />(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a New York district contract?<br /><br /><br /><br />This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.&nbsp; Responses should be received prior to 2:00 PM EST on 12 May 2011.<br /><br /><br /><br />Responses should be sent to:<br /><br /><br /><br />U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br /><br />26 Federal Plaza<br /><br />Room 1843<br /><br />Attn: Scott Helmer<br /><br />New York, NY 10278<br />

<DESC>Contract W91151-09-M-0100 provides for personnel. management, and services necessary to perform the Children's Ministry Services function in support of the Garrison Chaplain's office at Fort Hood, Texas.  An extension of this contract is being requested in order to continue the programs in place to run concurrent to the school year which ends on/about May 31, 2011.  This contract expires on April 30, 2011, which would negatively affect these programs by terminating them prior to the end of the school year.  Furthermore, a new contract will not be in place until July 1, 2011, and by extending the current contract will allow the current programs to run uninterrupted for the children of Fort Hood participating in this important program.

Justification Review Document

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  VA Black Hills, Fort Meade, SD

2.  Description of Action:  A Firm Fixed-Price contract is contemplated for acquisition of services for repair of a high pressure steam boiler at the Fort Meade Central Heating Plant.

3.  Description of Commodities:  Work consists of providing internal boiler repairs of the refractory system by Rasmussen Mechanical Services of Rapid City, South Dakota.  Work includes replacing the refractory cone to include a new ceramic blanket, stainless steel, specialized anchors and glue, and misc, refractory items. The burner may need to be removed and reinstalled depending on the extent of damage. If the burner is affected the boiler needs to be re-tuned. 

4.  Statutory Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: Boiler safety device testing was being conducted on April 7th , 2011, and during the testing process the refractory system failed around the burner cone and the boiler was placed out of service until repairs can be completed.  The type of refractory repair needed is specialized.  Due to the geographic location of the Black Hills Region, the source of supply for this type of service is limited.  Rasmussen Mechanical Services is the only firm in the local area or firm in South Dakota that we are aware of that can provide this specialized service.  This vendor has provided similar services on other boiler systems at this facility and has established past performance on responsiveness, competence, and cost control in this type of work. 

The boiler should be placed in service as quick as possible to ensure uninterrupted pressurized steam is maintained in the facility for critical patient care services (heat, sterilization, food preparation, etc.). Having this boiler out of service for an extended period reduces our contingency planning and increases our risk for interrupted steam supply for the facility which would have significant impacts.. Therefore, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Statutory Authority 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) is being cited.

6. Sources Solicited: Rasmussen Mechanical Services was contacted to determine the extent of the boiler damage and estimate repairs as they are the only known local vender providing this specialized repair service. They are familiar with the facility and our boiler systems. They are in a position to proceed with ordering repair materials and upon arrival can initiate repairs as soon as given approval to proceed.

7.  Market Research Conducted:  The NAICS code for this type of work is 238220, Plumbing, Heating and Air-Conditioning Contractors, and although there are many contractors in the area and in South Dakota that fall into this category, few are specialized in refractory boiler repair.  So, a Sources Sought announcement was posted on the FBO website for 7 days to seek other companies that could perform this specialized type of work, and no replies were received. To the best of my knowledge, Rasmussen Mechanical Services is the only authorized contractor available in this area to make these repairs.
 
8. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The following additional reason is cited for using the selected vendor, Rasmussen Mechanical Services, as a sole source vender:  

	Rasmussen Mechanical Services can both repair the refractory around the burner cone and also re-tune the boiler if and when the burner needs to be physically removed and re-installed thus negating the need to coordinate between two separate companies. 

10.  Actions to remove Barriers to Competition: Boiler projects are planned in the future to upgrade equipment that will reduce likelihood for emergency repairs. 

11.  Fair and Reasonable Price:  Pricing for previous work performed by this contractor has always been in line with Government estimates.  The quoted price of $16,284.69 is fair and reasonable as compared to previous work completed on the boiler. 
 
12.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  Based upon the information provided herein, I believe the justification for awarding this project to Rasmussen Mechanical Services on a sole-source basis is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and recommend we proceed as such.
