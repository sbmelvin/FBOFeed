STATEMENT OF WORK FOR
HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL ALTITUDE TRAINING
1.0 Scope	
Naval Special Warfare Training Detachment ONE (NSWTD-1) conducts 21 days of continuous special reconnaissance (SR) unit level training (ULT) Tooele, Utah. This training will be conducted two (2) times in the remainder of Fiscal Year 2010.  Contractor is to assist with Part One of this ULT, which consists of six (6) days of complex High Environmental Altitude Training (HEAT) and one (1) day of site survey/conditions per training block.  Part One of the 14-day training blocks must occur in the vicinity of Tooele, Utah, as the remainder of the training will take place in this same location.  As Part One of training is completed, trainees transition immediately to the next part of the training. Contractor shall conduct classroom and practical HEAT evolutions. The Tooele area provides terrain and altitude similar to current deployment operations environment. In addition, Tooele Army Depot provides berthing, classroom, briefing rooms and other facilities at no cost in support of NSWTD-1 training objectives. 
2.0 Background

SEAL TEAM FIVE and SEAL TEAM SEVEN are established Echelon IV Commands under Naval Special Warfare Group ONE (NSWG-1) providing Operational Forces to Special Operation Forces (SOF) Units forward and Geographic Combatant Commanders in support of multiple theaters.  These commitments require the capability to conduct operations in varied hostile environmental and terrain conditions, which, if personnel are not properly trained and equipped, will reduce operational capabilities, personnel safety, and mission success. The varied steep and high altitude terrains encountered during tactical operations requires the education and training of Naval Special Warfare personnel in the use of specialized equipment and how to move tactical elements, supporting elements, and detained personnel without relinquishing security and tactical advantage.  Operations conducted in these vertical areas require technical equipment, knowledge and demonstrated skills to ensure the safety of individuals and units alike. Contractor services will act as a force multiplier, enhancing unit capabilities and improving readiness and effectiveness of NSWG-1 by providing technical and tactical resources. Contractor support is critical in assisting NSWG-1 and NSWTD-1 in meeting emerging mission essential requirements.

<DESC>Firm-Fixed Contract for repair of Kaplan blades. Stockton Power Plant is located in Stockton, MO and has a single turbine-generator unit. The turbine is an adjustable 6 blade Kaplan unit, with a runner diameter of 280 inches. In February 2009, one of the blades broke off. The position of the benchmarks indicate that this failure initiated from the top, inside (pressure, hub side) corner of the blade at the downstream cutout. The weight of a runner blade for this unit is 22,000 pounds. The estimated weight of the broken blade section is 14,000 pounds. The blade section has been located in the bottom of the draft tube. The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, incidentals, and equipment to perform the work required to repair blade.
