<DESC>USAID/Cambodia requests proposals from qualified persons or firms with experience to assist the Government and the Vietnamese private sector to overcome select impediments and support the development and growth of the Vietnamese private sector and through this growth, accelerate the country?s transition toward a more open market-based economy.  The Contractor shall approach the tasks and development of Vietnam?s indigenous private sector through involvement in the areas of small and medium size enterprise (SME) policy environment, SME capacity building/information, training and technology (ITT) and SME access to credit which together shall contribute to the aim of improving the competitiveness of Vietnam?s indigenous private sector. A three year cost plus fixed fee type contract (with possibility of extensions) is expected to be awarded.  Proposals will be reviewed and award made based upon the criteria set forth in the RFP, which shall include an evaluation of an offeror?s past performance.

It is anticipated that one contract will be awarded in a process to be described in the RFP. The total estimated funding will be approximately $2.0 million per year for a 3 year period with possibilities of extensions. USAID may award to one or more than one contractor if it is determined to be in USAID's interest to do so. As this is a results oriented activity, it is expected that funding will be based upon an agreeable workplan, verifiable achievement of required results and the availability of funds.

All questions related to this notice must be addressed in writing, fax or email to the contracting officer at the address stated above.  Specify the RFP number, and include your complete firm name, street address, phone and fax number and email address.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  The issuance date of the RFP is expected to be approximately fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this notice.  The closing date for submission of proposals will be approximately forty five (45) days from the actual RFP issuance date, and will be specified in the RFP. 


The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet.  By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5" diskette.  Only in instances where Internet access or utilization of diskettes is not possible will a hard copy of the RFP be distributed upon request. Requestors must confirm to the Contracting Officer their inability to access the RFP via the Internet before they request a diskette or hard copy of the document.

The RFP, once issued, can be viewed and downloaded from the Agency web site.  You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing in general, and particularly from overseas Missions. The USAID worldwide web address is http://www.usaid.gov .  Select "Business and Procurement" from the home page, then "USAID Procurements".  
On the following screen, select "Download Available USAID Solicitations". Here you will see a list of all new solicitations. You must confirm in writing to the Contracting Officer noted above that you have received the solicitation through the Internet. As the recipient of this solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the INTERNET in its entirety.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you downloaded the solicitation. Generally, the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt. However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet.  You are therefore advised to regularly check the USAID Internet site for amendments.  The publication of this notice does not obligate the U.S. Government to award a contract.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 002 – 8 March 2003.  The purpose of this amendment is to answer vendor questions.  The date for receipt of quotes IS NOT extended.  Clauses and Provisions incorporated by reference are available at the following web site address: farsite.hill.af.mil.  1.  QUESTION: I would like to know where both types of paper which you are asking for are to be used.  Is it for Digital Printing or for an Offset Printer, this makes a difference as to which paper is to be used.  ANSWER:  The 13 1/4 x 18 1/8 paper is for the DI press.  The 11 x 17 paper is for RISO graphs.  2.  QUESTION: Will any of the paper be used for digital printing?  ANSWER: Yes, the 13 1/4 x 18 1/8.  3. QUESTION: Are both sheet sizes grain long?  One size did not have this designation.  ANSWER:  Only 13 1/4 x 18 1/8 paper is long grain.  4. QUESTION: Do both need to be ream wrapped packages of 500 sheets per package in the carton of 2,500 sheets?  ANSWER:  No just the 11x17 paper.  5. QUESTION: The 13 1/4" x 18 1/8" size is new to the market and the standards are bulk packed and 1,300 sheets in a moisture resistant carton not the 2,500 sheets. Would I be able to bid 2 each of these (2,600 sheets)?  This would be more cost effective for you and me versus doing a custom 2,500 sheets.  ANSWER:  No special packaging is required.  Please quote the commercial packaging - 2,600 sheets is acceptable.  6. QUESTION: Can you give an approximate delivery date once awarded?   ANSWER:  The paper is needed as soon as possible.  Please quote your best delivery date as it is an evlauation factor.  7.  QUESTION: The manufacturers are having a difficult time locating the product requested in CLIN0001: 13-1/4 x 18-1/8, 60lb. paper.  Producing it can be done through a converter, but would add to the cost.  ANSWER:  The product is currently available on the market and has been purchased.  It is up to the vendor to locate sources and quote on a product that meets the government’s stated requirement.  8.  QUESTION: Do you currently have a supplier for this product?  I am trying to ascertain the manufacturer of the product.  Better to use an existing source than to re-invent the wheel.  The end result, the government gets the best price possible.  ANSWER:  The product is currently being purchased, however, it is up to the vendor to locate sources.  9.  QUESTION: Is there a mandatory recycled content?  ANSWER:  The paper for the DI MUST be Class A or new paper  13 x 18 .  The 11 x17 can have recycled content.  10. QUESTION: Is there a minimum brightness required?  ANSWER:  No, the paper must be WHITE.    AMENDMENT 001 – 5 March 2003.  In response to vendor questions, the subject synopsis solititaion is amended to include “offset” in the paper description.
