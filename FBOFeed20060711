If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized and posted at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. Furthermore, this procurement is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns; however, ALL interested parties are requested to respond.  If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled.

All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this synopsis not later than July 25, 2006, 2:00 PM PST.  Please submit all requested documentation listed below to: Rebecca E.

In addition, Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102 and 4.1201, apply to this procurement.

The piping will cross terrain that varies; therefore the contractor shall be responsible for providing any and all supports required to safely secure the pipe from all forces including hydraulic loadings. The contractor shall propose and submit a piping layout for approval by the government. The piping will have to cross the road; therefore, the contractor shall provide a road crossing that will not affect the flow of traffic and the flow of water. Road security is scheduled to change around the time of the contract that may require a second road crossing.   Therefore the contractor shall provide an option for an additional road crossing.

The contractor shall also provide the fuel and secondary containment for the fuel and any other hazardous material used in the system.  The contractor shall provide and install the necessary suction lines to the lake. Option B.	The contactor shall provide two submersible pumps driven by electric motors.

<DESC>The procurement contemplated is for a Radar Target Generators (RTG) for the APG-63 (V)1 and APG-70 radar test benches at the Integrated Avionics Test Facility (IATF) IAW specifications and attachments identified in the solicitation.  This RTS shall include hardware and software to realisitically generate precise, user-defined target returns for the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar systems.  The completed effort will provide a fully-integrated RTS with multiple target channels capable of accurately producing synthetic radar targets.The IATF uses RTGs to conduct radar operational flight program (OFP) testing for F-15 aircraft.  Det 2, 28 TS currently has no target generation capability for the APG-63(V)1 radar, which is installed in the majority of the F-15C aircraft fleet.  The absence of aan APG-63(V)1 RTS prevents the IATF from fully evaluating the APG-63(V)1.  Additionally, the existing IATF APG-70 RTS is based on obsolete technology and is over 10 years old.  The age of the existing APG-70 RTS is becoming a limiting factor as the parts continue to age and fail.  These deficiencies severely limit the Air Force’s ability to fully test F-15 OFPs as they are released to the community.  The IATF’s focus on integrated avionics testing hinges on the ability to generate realistic radar targets with overlaid jamming to evaluate the radar’s performance in an electronic attack environment.  Completion of the RTS integration will permit successful F-15 radar testing and allow versatility and increased cost savings not possible through conventional flight testingflight-testing. A firm-fixed price contract award is contemplated. This action will be unrestricted and open to all parties interested. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511 with a small business employee size standard of 750. It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 16 June 2006 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Paper copies will not be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/ amendments to any and all documents.  The site visit is scheduled for Wednesday 21 June 2006 at 8:30 A.M. CST.  In order to participate in the site visit, contractors must contact the individuals listed at the end of this synopsis description for further instruction.  All specific information about the site visit will be given at that time.  Contractors must be prepared to provide the government with specific information for clearance into the IATF such as Name, SSAN, Clearance Level, Citizenship, DOB, POB, and Unit/Company Assigned.  Any prospective contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. Information concerning CCR registered requirements may be viewed via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling the CCR Registration Center at 1-888-227-2423.

<DESC>THORLABS OPTICAL EQUIPMENT

The solicitation number is FA8601-06-T-0118.  The proposed contract is for the purchase of optical testing equipment and mounting hardware, which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1.  The proposed source is Newport Corporation.  The supplies being purchased are as follows: three (3) one inch diameter 2-axis (1310 nanometer – 1550 nanometer) fast steering mirrors.  The government anticipates a sole source award to Newport Corporation for the following reason:  the mirrors required for this effort must be of the same wavelength as the other equipment being purchased from vendors in order to provide the proper characteristics of the project. Without these mirrors to assist in the development of the desired outcome, the project cannot start, let alone be completed. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within eight (8) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any quotation/response should be faxed to Robin M. Hass, 88 CONS/PKBB, 937-656-1412, or e-mailed to Robin.Hass@wpafb.af.mil no later than 18 Jul 06.  Any questions should be directed to Robin M. Hass at 937-522-4647.

It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attention Capt Thompson, by COB 18 March 2005.  For those prime offerors that request a "face-to-face"  discussion of the draft SRD, we encourage you to contact Capt Thompson at 937- 255-4600 to make the arrangements.  We plan to hold these sessions 29 March through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK, Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) - SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11 Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and 3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent, understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0 requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources for Whole Body Imager (WBI) units for use in mass transit and aviation environments.  Offerors are requested to submit white papers for the TSA to determine capability and security clearance.  TSA intends to proceed as follows:

•	Solicitation of white papers by this announcement. 
•	Based on the evaluation of white papers received, TSA will identify eligible vendors.  Eligible vendors will be issued the Technical Requirements Document(s) (TRD) and Qualification Management Plan (QMP), and be authorized to contact TSL to arrange to provide one unit at no cost to the government for technical testing.
•	At the conclusion of technical testing, results will be assessed by TSA to determine if the system is effective and suitable enough to proceed to field testing.
•	Units determined to be not effective or suitable enough for field testing will be returned to the vendor at the vendor’s expense.
•	Vendors whose units are determined by TSA to be effective and suitable enough for field testing will be provided a Request for Proposal (RFP) for lease of four systems.  Three systems will be fielded for operational testing for 45-90 days at locations TBD by TSA and one system will remain at the TSL as the baseline reference unit.  Associated field testing support will also be required in the RFP.
•	At the conclusion of operational testing, all four units will be returned to the vendor.

The vendor may provide four units for mass transit or aviation environments, or may provide units for both environments by: (1) providing eight units total (four for each), (2) providing four units which are capable of operating in two modes: aviation and mass transit, or (3) providing four units for testing in one operational environment and modifying the units prior to testing in the second operational environment at the vendor’s discretion.

In order for systems to be eligible for submission for technical testing by the TSL, vendors must successfully complete independent radiological safety testing at their own expense to meet ANSI N43.17, and must provide the laboratory results or certification.  Radiological safety testing must be conducted on a unit that is representative of the final design as evidenced in the Bill of Materials that will be submitted.

Following determination by TSA that the system is effective and suitable for field testing, an RFP will be issued.  As stated above, the RFP will provide for lease of four systems, and will also require that the vendor provide training, maintenance, and technical advice (as needed) during the field experiment.  Policies, procedures and processes (including a vendor submitted concept of operations) associated with Whole Body Imager systems will be included in the evaluation.  If upgrades become available during field testing, TSA at its sole discretion will decide whether or not the upgrades will be installed and evaluated.  Upgrades or changes, if allowed by TSA, will be made at vendor’s expense.

Requirements

Whole Body Imager systems shall provide the capability/ability to (1) visually locate (applicable to both mass transit and aviation requirement) and (2) visually identify (applicable only to aviation requirement) potential threats on a person including beneath normal environment clothing or otherwise obscured.  The Whole Body Imager is intended to perform discreet, non-contact, and threat-queuing for both routine surveillance/screening and probable-cause search in aviation and/or mass transit applications.

For Aviation applications, the Whole Body Imager must be able to be integrated into the checkpoint environment.  This means that the system may be a portal and a screener may be available to instruct/guide passengers in proper positioning for scanning.  For mass transit applications, the Whole Body Imager must be able to function in an environment where: the individuals scanned are moving normally in the scanning space, there may be one or more individuals in the area scanned, and no local screener is available to guide passengers in the scan.

Whole Body Imaging systems will be used to aid in detection of metallic, non-metallic, and organic threats, and to aid in discriminating innocuous items.  The system may be used as either a primary or secondary means for detecting and or locating anomalous objects on a person in a mass transit and/or aviation environment.

When installed in aviation checkpoints, the imaging system and the screener workstation where image interpretation takes place may not be co-located.  In mass transit applications, the imaging system and the screener workstation where image interpretation takes place may or may not be co-located.  The WBI system must provide the capability to view images remotely.

Additional detailed requirements are contained in the TRD(s), which will be provided to vendors deemed eligible by TSA per above.

Submission Requirements for Announcement

Vendors may submit more than one white paper if they have more than one system appropriate for either mass transit and aviation environments, or may submit a single white paper if a system is appropriate for both environments. 

Interested Offerors shall submit white papers providing the following information:

•	Certification of site clearance up to Secret issued through the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) administered by the Defense Security Service (DSS).
•	Dunn & Bradstreet number to verify current registration in CCR.
•	Written commitment to provide radiological safety testing by a qualified independent laboratory. Subsequent proof of certification must be submitted immediately upon delivery of test unit to TSL. Failure to provide proof of certification will result in immediate disqualification from further participation, and return of the test unit at the vendor’s expense.
•	Certification of the ability to provide one test unit to the TSL at no cost within 120 days of authorization to submit and three additional units according to the delivery schedule specified in the RFP.
•	Written statement that the vendor can provide the services described in this announcement.
•	Vendors may, at their discretion, submit a description of the system indicating whether it’s active or passive and the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum used (i.e. MMW, X-ray, IR, etc.).
•	System dimensions (size, weight, height, and floor-loading in pounds per sq. inch) and listing of major end-item components.  In order to assess if the units can be physically accommodated in TSA checkpoints for aviation requirements the size requirements are as follows:  The footprint shall not exceed 4 square meters, height shall not exceed 3 meters and weight shall not exceed 650kg/m2.   For mass transit if the system is stand alone, then footprint shall not exceed 4 square meters and the height shall not exceed 3 meters.  If the system is intended to be incorporated into existing infrastructure such as walls, turnstiles, overhead installations, etc. then size, weight, shape and height shall be feasible for the intended means of installation.  Units that do not conform to these maximum size limitations will not be considered for testing.

Misrepresentations or inability to meet requirements stated in this announcement will be cause for immediate disqualification from any further participation in TSA WBI technical testing and field experimentation.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will require that the vendor: 

•	Conduct and administratively support Technical Interchange Meetings.
•	Conduct Post Award Conference.
•	Report on cost, schedule, and technical progress in meeting reviews/status reports.  
•	Provide and maintain a single point of contact for the Testing and Evaluation (T&E) program.
•	Conduct, or support the Government in conducting a Test Readiness Review (TRR) prior to performing any formal test.
•	Provide complete Bill of Materials (or Master Configuration Item List (MCIL)) at least 14 days prior to start of field testing.
•	Support site implementation, installation, integration, and equipment removal.
•	Develop Site Acceptance Test (SAT) Plans and Procedures and conduct SAT on-site for each unit under government supervision.
•	Develop and deliver Operator Manuals supporting operation by representative TSA operators. Provide real-time support such as a website or toll-free hotline where users may call to obtain guidance. 
•	Conduct operator and operator maintenance training at each installation site.
•	Develop and provide training simulators for each site.  Training simulators shall include an image library that is representative of images provided by the operational system.
•	Perform preventative and corrective maintenance, and provide technical assistance services as required during the course of the pilot.
•	Ensure effective security practices are in place to protect sensitive and classified information. 
•	Not disclose any information concerning TSA’s field experimentation program without specific authorization and pre-clearance of content by the Contracting Officer.

Response Format and Due Date

Written responses are required.  Responses shall be prepared using 12 point font; and shall not exceed 4 pages in length, including all data displays, charts, graphs, and tables.  The due date for receipt of responses to this announcement is 4:30 pm EST July 20, 2006

<DESC>OVERVIEW

As a matter of urgency, the German Government will pre-finance works in support of the expansion of the German Provisional Reconstruction Team (PRT) contingent of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) based in Mazar-E-Sharif, Afghanistan. The German Government is requesting additional infrastructure procurement measures to finalize the re-structuring of the Northern Region and build-up and effective Forward Support Base (FSB) in the area, both of which are time-critical issues.

As part of the detailed planning work required for achieving full operational capability (FOC), the German Government intends to award multiple contracts. Germany is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which is expected to be authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The estimated value of this project is 11.6 million EUR ($14.8 million USD).

At this time, it is unclear whether the German Government intends to advertise these civil works under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) or National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedure, within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on up to eight (8) specific civil works projects. However, the German Government has requested permission from the NATO Infrastructure Committee to be exempted from International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on some/all of these projects so that they can be handled under NCB rules for contract award, with individual contracts to be awarded to local Afghan firms. The Germans feel this way of proceeding will guarantee a timely implementation of work, while avoiding problems associated with contract award to a major contractor, especially in Afghanistan. Contract award to local firms allows direct influence to be exercised and avoid the often time-consuming entry formalities. In addition, the involvement of local firms offers the possibility to react swiftly to unforeseeable circumstances while, at the same time, enhancing acceptance by the local population which again serves the purpose of stabilizing the security situation of the northern region. Thus, they expect the stronger involvement of local trade and industry in contract award to have a stabilizing effect on the security situation.

The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) to be issued is unknown at this time. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-ISAF-GERMANY-FSB-MAZA-2006.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The works and their estimated costs include the following:

1. Signal Centre with antenna field (2nd construction phase) - 5.0 million EUR
2. Build-up of recreational installations including sports facilities - 3.0 million EUR
3. IT/FM cabling with civil works - 2.0 million EUR
4. Patrol path - 1.0 million EUR
5. Water supply for fire fighting purposes - 0.2 million EUR
6. Waste collection point and recycling/disposal - 0.2 million EUR
7. Preparation of the working field for washing facilities (ground work, supply lines, sewage pipes, etc.) - 0.1 million EUR
8. Weather station - 0.1 million EUR

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: TBD

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: TBD

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD

4. Anticipated contract award date: TBD

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), PG-13 Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS), currently intend to enter into a contract with Keithley Instruments, Inc. Cleveland OH. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334515. Anticipated award of contract is July 2006.  The item description is equipment support development of Marine Corps Electro Optical Systems Test Facility.  The following is required for purchase:  CLIN 0001 Quantity (4) System Electrometer (Part # 6514); CLIN 0002 Quantity (1) Shipping charge (to Dumfries, VA).  The following requirements to the above quantities are as follows:  The variety of weapon sights and irradiating devices to be evaluated span a rather wide range of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum (visible band—VIS, near infra-red band—NIR, and the short wave infra-red band—SWIR) and therefore require test equipment and targets that can encompass that wavelength range.  The test equip!  ment and targets necessary to characterize these sights must themselves be characterized by way of calibration procedures which require a capability to measure extremely low currents from photodetectors which are used to enact the calibration.  In addition, the output images from the devices under test must be completely characterized, and this also requires equipment having the versatility to measure the extremely low currents from the imaging sensors.  In all cases the low current measurements must spa 0 milliamps maximum down to a low current resolution of 100 attoAmps (equal to 1x10-16 amps).  Such a low current measurement capability requires that the input bias current not exceed 3 femtoAmps (equal to 3x10-15 amps).  The measurement equipment must also have the capability to measure DC volts:  10 microvolt resolution up to 200 volts maximum.  Computer control of this measurement equipment is essential in order to conduct the measurements quickly in succession for auto!  matic data acquisition for some of the test setups   Additionally the  equipment must be able to be calibrated with traceability to the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).  The Electrometer that is produced by Keithley Instruments, Inc. model 6514, enables the measurement of these extremely low currents, voltage measurements, and with computer control capability, and therefore meets all these requirements.  Associated software, if any, must not interact with the NMCI network.  The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using simplified acquisition procedures and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR parts 12 and 13. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals, as the Government has determined that there is no other vendor that meets the requirements set forth above. A determination by the Government not to compet!  e this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Questions concerning this intent can be e-mailed to: crystal.m.clark@usmc.mil or faxed to number (703) 432-3526. The date and time of closing is MONDAY, JULY 17, 2006, 3:30pm EST (Eastern Standard Time).

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for approximately 266 Tomahawk Block IV Composite Capsule Launching System (CCLS) Capsules.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS)  P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ  85734-1337.  RMS is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer of the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RMS solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV Missile.  RMS currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  RMS is responsible for maintaining the existing capsules and performing any required re-certification, repair, refurbishment or remanufacture of them.  RMS is the only source that possesses the current technical, configuration, manufacturing data, and unique expertise required to produce a CCLS capsule capable of complying with the Tactical Tomahawk Block IV configuration.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to provide these CCLS Capsules, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of cost.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia announces its intent to issue a sole source solicitation to Sonalysts, Inc. for the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) for biomedical and operational research services in support of the Navy Lab’s research mission.  Specifically, the contractor must have the scientific knowledge and practical experience working in the Submarine Atmosphere Health Assessment program (SAHAP) to determine epidemiological factors of importance in ensuring the health of Naval personnel; conducting studies and research on problems associated with disabled submarines (DISSUB) to maximize chances of survival to include evaluation of multiple physiological parameters in terms of environmental and physiological systems; and the investigation of the performance and utility of Search and Rescue (SAR) devices, particularly escape scenarios.  The services include tasks such as the design, development, test, and evaluation of procedures, guidance, equipment, and systems to enhance human performance under the various environments mentioned above.  Sonalysts is the incumbent contractor and is considered the only source capable of providing the highly specialized services.  It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, since only Sonalysts possesses the required knowledge of the NSMRL programs mentioned above, and has the requisite research background and capabilities to continue the on-going support of the programs due to the extensive acumen in the respective research fields that is required of each researcher.  Current Sonalysts research efforts at the lab do not have a defined completion point.  Various projects and studies build on past research performed and are the basis of future projects and studies; thus, there is an integral need for a company with the corporate knowledge, research skills, and personnel resources that Sonalysts possesses.  It is anticipated that the services will be provided through the award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract for a base period of performance of one year with four one-year option periods.  All questions should be directed to Leanne Hanger at leanne.hanger@navy.mil.  Number Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<SUBJECT>70--LICENSE FOR MPEG4 AVC/H.264 IP CORE AND SOFTWARE
<SOLNBR>N0016706M5191
<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison (301)227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, (NSWCCD) has been tasked to develop a completely reconfigurable payload for unmanned vehicle systems and in support,  requires a license agreement for MPEG4 AVC/H.264 IP Core and Software. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with 4i2i Communications Ltd; and award a firm-fixed price purchase order under the authority provided in FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The first objective is to develop an advanced and reconfigurable information processing and a communications exploitation environment within restricted size, weight, power and performance limitation characteristics. The 4i2i embedded IP Core software works exclusively with Alpha Data’s PMC cards to provide a unique image compression algorithm. While other H.264 algorithms exist in the market, none has been implemented on PMC cards such as that supplied by Alpha Data. This embedded software supports not only the intellectual Property Core (IP) cited below, but it is the only system within the PMC format that has the unique VHDL interface and Communications Modules that will support the reconfiguring capability required for this project. The combination of the PMC card and IP core is the only solution currently on the market that will enable successful implementation of Panther II requirements. Panther II will require the use of highly-proprietary technology which is enabled o!  nly by the flexibility of the Alpha Data hardware. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.   A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 07/26/2006.

<DESC>NOTICE OF UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL.  The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with the Transplant Communications, Inc., Baltimore, MD  21224.  This procurement will be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 13.  The purpose of this acquisition is for the production of a short (12-15) minute video overview of Donation After Cardiac Death (DCD) that will assist Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) in professional education efforts with hospitals in their service areas.  The video will address the legal and ethical issues of DCD as well as the benefits for both transplant recipients and donor families.  The video proposes also to provide steps to hospitals for instituting DCD programs and identify actions that donor hospitals, OPOs and transplant centers can use to eliminate possible barriers that might prevent creating a DCD program. Because the program is based on an unsolicited proposal, which the Government has determined  to be an unique and innovative approach that was independently originated and developed by the offeror; without the Government’s supervision; benefits the Agency’s mission, and was not an advance proposal for a known agency requirement, the Transplant Communications, Inc. is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required work and service under authority in 41 U.S.C. 253(d) (1) A, as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (i)(A).  The Contractor has spent a substantial amount of research on this project and will do this work with a large portion of the effort as an in-kind contribution.  The anticipated period of performance is for twelve (12) months.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990. This announcement is for information only.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  The reference number is #06-S234-0524DLC.

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service in Pullman, WA has a requirement for a Luminex200 System w/MasterPlex CT with MasterPlex GT v.2.3 Analysis software and MasterPlex QT v.2.5.  The Luminex System is a flexible analyzer base on the principles of flow cytomety that meets the needs of our unit for geotyping and protein based assays with suspension array technology.  The Luminex 200 instrument can analyze up to 100 fluorescently dyed 5.6 micron-sized polystyrene microspheres that act as both the identifier and the solid surface to determine positive hybridization.  The analyzer consists of
integrated lasers, optics, advanced fluidics and high-speed digitalsignal processors allowing determination both specificity of bead analyte and detection of positive sequence specific genomic hybridization.  Our present system runs genotyping assays with a Luminex instrument in a WSU core facility.  It is important to continue to utilize the Luminex technology in the interest of consistency with our assays.  However, our needs to genotyping make our needs for software unique.  MiraiBio provides the basic Luminex200 instrument, installs and services the unit, and provides three types of software that meet our
specific needs.  One type of software provided by MiraiBio is MasterPlex CT, which provides integrated control of the Luminex200 instrument and provides a platform for data acquisition.  More precisely, the MasterPlex CT software allows for integrated setup and maintenance of the instrument, remote monitoring of the instrument and increased user control for data acquisition.  Also included I the MiraiBio package is MasterPlex GT genotyping Software.  MasterPlex FT has been specifically
designed to simplify genotying and haplotying analyses from multiplexed data generated with the Luminex200.  Additionally, the MasterPex QT software is specifically designed to interface with the acquisition (MasterPex CT) software and to analyze cytokine assays to meet our needs.   The USDA intends on negotiating with the only know source MiraiBio.  Interested firms are encouraged to submit proposals to Vickie Lutes as listed in this notice.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS!  The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for the Remote Seismic Data Acquisition System consisting of the model TL remote Seismic Data Acquisition System – battery powered (10 each) and model CL externally powered data receiver for TLs (1 each).  Requested delivery for this requirement is approximately thirty (30) days after receipt of the purchase order.  This is a Sole Source with SHI IAW FAR 6.302-1.  SHI is the only source capable of fulfilling the government’s requirement as their equipment suite has become the recognized equipment and analysis standard for all International Monitoring System and United States Atomic Detection system locations.  One cannot combine the data from diverse remote seismic data acquisition and monitoring systems if the systems do not follow a common data standard.  Having equipment that transmits and receives information in a format compatible with the existing equipment is vital to maintain a workable data and error-checking standard using multiple suites of equipment.  Being able to monitor equipment status, poll remote sensors and receive collected information using existing data standards is critical in reducing the amount of processing overhead encountered when having to deal with multiple data standards.  As the International Monitoring System’s primary field seismic analysis equipment integrator, SHI is the sold US developer of software and hardware to collect, monitor and analyze field seismic data.  In addition, SHI is the only contractor capable of integrating data produced by US and foreign sensors used as part of the International Monitoring System.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 3829 with a business size of 500 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 334519.  Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis.  45 CONS/LGCBB has determined that Science Horizons, Inc. is the only source capable of providing this requirement.  Phone calls will not be accepted.  Point of contact is Bonnie Pruett, Contract Specialist, 45 CONS/LGCBB, 1201 Edward H.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development Mission to Tanzania (USAID/Tanzania) issues this Request for Proposals (RFP) for an umbrella grants management and capacity building program that would focus on two components of the U.S. Government’s (USG) HIV/AIDS Program:  1) establishment, financial support, and capacity building of Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) sites for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and 2) operation of a multi-donor program that provides small grants to indigenous organizations for projects addressing HIVAIDS prevention, care, treatment, and impact mitigation.  Subject to the availability of funds, USAID/Tanzania intends to award a Cost Reimbursable Contract for $23 million over a 4-year period.  This program might expand to up to $26 million due to anticipated rapid scale-up of activities to address care, treatment, and capacity building needs in Tanzania or the possible combination of the grants making and capacity building components of this contract and the technical component of ART services that is presently provided through a separate award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army TACOM Picatinny has a requirement for the manufacture and  installation of a Dry Bag Isostatic Press System Conventional blocking presses are used to produce billets of high explosive  (HE) from a variety of energetic compositions.  These billets are then  sectioned and machined to meet the specifications required to fabricate a  particular warhead.  The current process is labor intensive and has limited  applications in an advanced research and development facility.  Tooling  requirements for these conventional presses are stringent due to the high  compaction pressures and close clearances permitted for safe operations.  The  conventional blocking presses have a proven record of reliability for  producing simple, repetitive parts.  They will continue to be used  extensively in the research and development of warheads and energetics. The isostatic pressing system sought provides an alternate method of  consolidating HE with a higher degree of efficiency, quality, and safety.   Isostatic pressing widens the scope of design by allowing researches the  flexibility to produce parts of complex shape and size.  New and unique  warhead designs can be produced through isostatic pressing, as well as, the  ability to case-load certain types of warheads. The objective of this effort is to manufacture, deliver, assemble, and install  an automatic, dry bag isostatic press system to be configured for remote  control operations.  This press system shall be used to produce shaped  explosive charges and/or to press-load explosives into warhead cases. The contractor shall provide a dry bag isostatic press system that shall meet  the specified footprint area to be housed in the designated building.  The  system shall meet all dimensional requirements and working capacity,  pressure, vacuum and temperature conditioning requirements. The remote control of the system shall be performed by a Supervisory Control  And Data Acquisition (SCADA) to monitor and control the critical parameters.  The contractor shall provide an isostatic system without exposed threads,  metal pinch points, sparking parts, or sliding parts to prevent explosive  build up. These requirements allow for the safety of the operator(s). The contractor shall install and connect the isostatic press system, SCADA  system, and all ancillary equipment for the operation.  Training is required to ensure that ARDEC operators will be able to perform operational and  programmable functions without service calls unless malfunctions occur. The contractor shall follow each milestone for the specified period of  performance. Any questions, please contact Lance Drennan 973-724-4842 lance.drennan@us.army.mil

The AN/PSS-14 Mine Detecting Set is a dual sensor mine detector that provides Army Combat Engineers with a much-improved capability to detect metallic and low-metallic  mines over the capabilities of the previously fielded AN/PSS-12 Mine Detecting Set.  The AN/PSS-14 Mine Detecting Set uses Ground Penetrating Radar coupled with an improved metal detector, an integrated algorithm suite, and enhanced audio features.  An AN /PSS-14 Training Set contains one (1) Sweep Monitoring System (SMS) and one Training Target Set.  The SMS, is a camera-based training tool that assists students in acquiring skills to swing the detector properly. The SMS tracks the movement of the AN/PSS-1 4's sensor head using an advanced video tracker and provides feedback to the operator regarding proper speed, height and ground coverage.  Major SMS components include: rugged, weatherproof computer; AC Power cable assembly; European wall outlet adapter; m ain interface cable assembly; Operator's Manual; Quick Reference Card; Tripod Base Assembly; Tripod Upper Mast; Tripod Foot Pad Assembly; Ground Stakes (3); camera assemblies; speaker; calibration tape; and colored foam target balls.  The training target s et (TTS) consists of simulated mine targets.  The TTS contains the following training targets: fourteen (14) anti-tank metallic targets TT-M-AT, fourteen (14) anti-personnel metallic targets TT-M-AP, twelve (12) anti-tank low-metallic targets 30 centimeter s in diameter TT-30-AT with specified metallic insert, fourteen (14) anti-tank low-metallic targets 25 centimeters in diameter TT-25-AT with specified metallic insert, twelve (12) anti-tank low-metallic targets 20 centimeters in diameter TT-20-AT with spec ified metallic insert, twelve (12) anti-personnel low-metallic targets 12 centimeters in diameter TT-12-AP with specified metallic insert, fourteen (14) anti-personnel low-metallic targets 9 centimeters in diameter TT-9-AP with specified metallic insert, a nd twelve (12) anti-personnel low-metallic targets 6 centimeters in diameter TT-6-AP with specified metallic insert.

<DESC>Amendment No. 3 to Solicitation No. BBGCON3606S6178-MB, dated 5/24/06 is hereby issued to extend the proposal due date and to answer questions received from interested offerors.  THE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS HAS BEEN EXTENDED from 2:00p.m. EDT, Thursday, July 13, 2006 to 2:00p.m., EDT, Friday, July 21, 2006. 
Following are questions received and their corresponding answers:
Question 1:  Depending on the whether they are single function or multifunction, the difference in time could be 4/1 and the cost significantly different.  We would suggest single function digital relays, either GE DIFC or Baslar BE-1-51B.  For a multifunction relay then GE SR750.  Based on the one-line E-501 it appears like the relays were single function since the relay was indicated as a 51 device.  Please clarify.  Answer 1: Please provide multifunction relays as required per the specification.  A single function relay could be proposed as an alternate to the bid.  Question 2:  If IBB are just changing out breakers, why would there be any change in relay settings if the same ratio CTs are used? Please clarify.  Answer 2:  The Short Circuit and Coordination Study has not been updated and is required.  Changes to the settings, if any, are part of this requirement.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER IS CHANGED FROM FA4819-06-T-0033 TO FA4819-06-R-0008.  The procurement contemplated is for a Radar Target Generators (RTG) for the APG-63 (V)1 and APG-70 radar test benches at the Integrated Avionics Test Facility (IATF) IAW specifications and attachments identified in the solicitation.  This RTS shall include hardware and software to realisitically generate precise, user-defined target returns for the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar systems.  The completed effort will provide a fully-integrated RTS with multiple target channels capable of accurately producing synthetic radar targets.The IATF uses RTGs to conduct radar operational flight program (OFP) testing for F-15 aircraft.  Det 2, 28 TS currently has no target generation capability for the APG-63(V)1 radar, which is installed in the majority of the F-15C aircraft fleet.  The absence of aan APG-63(V)1 RTS prevents the IATF from fully evaluating the APG-63(V)1.  Additionally, the existing IATF APG-70 RTS is based on obsolete technology and is over 10 years old.  The age of the existing APG-70 RTS is becoming a limiting factor as the parts continue to age and fail.  These deficiencies severely limit the Air Force’s ability to fully test F-15 OFPs as they are released to the community.  The IATF’s focus on integrated avionics testing hinges on the ability to generate realistic radar targets with overlaid jamming to evaluate the radar’s performance in an electronic attack environment.  Completion of the RTS integration will permit successful F-15 radar testing and allow versatility and increased cost savings not possible through conventional flight testingflight-testing. A firm-fixed price contract award is contemplated. This action will be unrestricted and open to all parties interested. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511 with a small business employee size standard of 750. It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 16 June 2006 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Paper copies will not be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/ amendments to any and all documents.  The site visit is scheduled for Wednesday 21 June 2006 at 8:30 A.M. CST.  In order to participate in the site visit, contractors must contact the individuals listed at the end of this synopsis description for further instruction.  All specific information about the site visit will be given at that time.  Contractors must be prepared to provide the government with specific information for clearance into the IATF such as Name, SSAN, Clearance Level, Citizenship, DOB, POB, and Unit/Company Assigned.  Any prospective contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. Information concerning CCR registered requirements may be viewed via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling the CCR Registration Center at 1-888-227-2423.

<DESC>This requirement is restricted for set-aside as a national 8(a) competitive acquisition.  

The solicitation for the Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB) SABER contract will be released soon.  It is tentatively scheduled for release on or about 31 May 06.

This is a follow-on effort to the current contract, F33601-01-D-W005.  Required contractor expertise includes a Contract Manager, Environmental Manager, Design Manager, Quality Assurance Evaluator, and Project Manager.

Prime Contractors shall be capable of securing bonding in the amount of at least $2,000,000 and potentially as much as $5,000,000.

Please note that as of the date of this notice being posted the above PIXS website is not up and running.  It is anticipated that the web site will be operational by the time the solicitation is ready to be issued.  In the event the website remains unavailable an alternative means will be posted for public information.

The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?

Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<DESC>COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE-X AMENDMENT 039 (29 SEP 05) – Response to Industry Question Concerning Program Protection Plan The CSAR-X Program Protection Plan (PPP), as identified with the PRV Security  Classification Guide, is a Government document providing information to CSAR-X  test and operational users on the requirements to protect the CSAR-X aircraft  within the test or operational environments.  The draft RFP includes the  requirement for the offerors to propose the efforts necessary to support the  CSAR-X program office in developing the CSAR-X Program Protection Plan.  The  PPP should not drive any design requirements.  All design efforts for the CSAR- X program should focus on the technical requirements as set forth in the CSAR-X  SRD and RFP. Technology that needs to be protected in the test and operational environment  includes, but is not limited to, the following; 1.  Technology used to defeat a threat 2.  Information used to accomplish a threat defeat. 3.  Examples: sensor performance, countermeasures performance, intelligence  receiver performance, CNI performance, encryption/decryption methods/equipment. 4.  Any deficiencies related to the above. The CSAR-X Extended Reference Library document has also been updated to include  a link to TO 00-35D-54 in the unrestricted documents section. COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE-X AMENDMENT 038 (22 SEP 05) – Draft RFP Sections L+M The CSAR-X Flight has issued an updated draft RFP Sections L+M for SDD and  initial Production efforts for industry review and comment. Please provide  review comments to SOFSG/THK by COB 26 September 2005.  Attachments to L+M  remain unchanged except for attachment 2 (posted on PIXS 21 Sep) and attachment  17 (provided to potential offerors 21 Sep).  The CSAR-X Extended Reference  Library document has also been updated and moved into the regular document  library. COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE-X AMENDMENT 037 (17 AUG 05) – Response to Industry  Request for Cargo Air Load Model The Air Force no longer supports the Cargo Air Load Model (CALM).  The current  program is the Automated Air Load Planning System (AALPS), and is available at  https://www.tis.army.mil/aalps/default.htm.  AALPS helpdesk requests must be  directed to 1 (866) 822-4672. The AALPS program is available on 3 disks and is  free of charge. COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE-X AMENDMENT 036 (22 JUL 05) – Draft RFP and Draft  Sections L+M and Attachments The CSAR-X Flight has issued an updated draft RFP and updated draft Sections  L+M with attachments for SDD and initial Production efforts for industry review  and comment. Please provide review comments to SOFSG/THK by 27 July 2005.  The  CSAR-X Extended Reference Library has also be updated.  COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE-X AMENDMENT 035 (24 JUN 05) – Draft Production  Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) and Attachments The CSAR-X Flight has issued a draft CDRL package and attachments for  production efforts for industry review and comment.  Please provide review  comments to ASC/LUH by 29 June 2005. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 034 (20 JUN 05) – Program name change The Personnel Recovery Vehicle program has been renamed “Combat Search and  Rescue-X” (CSAR-X). The formal RFP, and supporting documentation, will be updated to reflect the  change. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 033 (26 MAY 05) – Draft Contract Data  Requirements List (CDRL) and Attachments The PRV Flight has issued a draft CDRL package and attachments for SDD efforts  for industry review and comment.  Please provide review comments to ASC/LUH no  later than one day prior to scheduled face to face discussions. Current plans  remain to provide for face to face discussions of contractor comments during  the week of 6 June 2005.  Please contact the individuals listed below to  establish date for discussions, if not already scheduled. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 032 (18 MAY 05) – Draft Sections L+M and  Attachments The PRV Flight has issued draft Sections L+M and attachment.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replaceme  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or co which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct?

Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt  Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD  An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3,  dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.

Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Geologic Hazards Team, has a requirement for services to coordinate project planning for the St. Louis Seismic Hazard Mapping Project, to produce high-resolution seismic hazard maps for the St. Louis metropolitan area of Missouri and Illinois.  Required tasks will include:  Coordinating Project meetings; scheduling Project field trips; leading outreach activities, to include creating and issuing press releases, providing story ideas to local TV and radio media regarding seismic hazards, and contacting local and regional professional organizations to educate their membership about Project issues and activities; and providing quarterly status reports to the USGS.  Proposed contractor must have demonstrated the following minimum qualifications:  1) Extensive knowledge and experience working with potential users of Project products, particularly the engineering, urban development, and public policy sectors in the St. Louis region; 2) Extensive knowledge of earthquake hazards, particularly those that affect the St. Louis region; 3) Familiarity with the development and implementation of earthquake education and outreach activities appropriate to the St. Louis region; and 4) Experience with marketing engineering products in the St. Louis region.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Phyllis Steckel, 2138 Meadow Oaks Lane, Washington, Missouri, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.  THIS ANNOUCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; NO FORMAL RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE.

<SOLNBR>06HQ34-NoSolicitation
<RESPDATE>080106
<ARCHDATE>07112007
<CONTACT>LYNDA MCCARTHY CONTRACT SPECIALIST 7036487336     lmccarthy@usgs.gov;
<DESC>Request for Comments This is not a notice for a solicitation.  This is only a Request For Comments (RFC).  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFC or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this RFC.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid; merely a request for comments.    Background: The Water Resources Discipline (WRD) of the USGS operates a critical real-time data collection system that provides data to support both the routine management of water-affected resources and emergency planning during extreme hydrologic events, such as flooding. The major data acquisition system that the WRD uses is the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Data Collection System (GOES DCS) which allows data to be acquired from remote sites using the GOES satellites.  A major vulnerability to WRD's system is the GOES receive facility at Wallops Island, Virginia operated by  the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS)  of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA). This facility is currently a single point of failure for acquiring data from the GOES DCS for WRD and other users who either directly or indirectly receive data from  this facility. WRD is addressing this vulnerability by placing a Direct Readout Ground Station (DRGS) system at the USGS Center for Earth Observation and Science (EROS) at Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  The DRGS  will receive data directly from the GOES satellites and provide an alternate source for data  transmitted over the GOES satellites. NOAA/NESDIS intends to support the implementation of this system by the USGS as long as the USGS agrees to receive the entire GOES DCS data stream and allow other GOES DCS users who are also dependent on the facility at Wallops Island to acquire data from this system as an alternate source to Wallops Island.   This system will become the major part of an interagency GOES Emergency Data Distribution Network (EDDN) supported by both GOES DCS users and NOAA/NESDIS.    To increase the independence of this alternate data collection system, WRD will consider as an option installing a GOES pilot transmitter at the Center for EROS. A pilot transmitter provides a reference signal that is used by all GOES receivers.  The pilot transmitter at the Center for EROS would be a backup for pilot transmitters operated by NOAA/NESDIS.   Finally, WRD will install a DOMSAT receiver that will acquire data from the Wallops Island facility via the DOMSAT communications satellite to provide a data feed from the Wallops Island facility to the Center for EROS.  The receiver will require the installation of a suitable antenna which shall be a part of the procurement. Important General Requirements: The procured system is intended to operate continuously 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and should be as automated as possible, requiring minimal operator intervention.   Significant events and failures that require operator intervention should be brought to the attention of staff support via alarms and critical event messages.    All components of the system shall have the capability to be monitored and controlled both locally and remotely over a Wide Area Network (WAN).  Request for Review and Comments: Drafts of a statement of work and system specifications have been developed by USGS/WRD and USGS/EROS for the procurement of the system described above.   They include the following documents: 	Statement of Work for a GOES Direct Readout Ground Station (DRGS) 	System at the Center for EROS 	Specifications for a GOES Direct Readout Ground Station (DRGS) 	System at the Center for EROS 	DAMS-NT Network Interface Specification  300/1200 BPS GOES Data Collection Platform Radio Set (DCPRS) Certification Standards These documents may be accessed by clicking on the link below: 	http://www.usgs.gov/contracts/docs/GOES/goesndx.html This Request for Comments (RFC) is to allow all vendors that may be interested in responding to a future Request for Proposal (RFP) to review these drafts and supply comments and suggestions. USGS is a strong advocate for the small business community and interested small businesses/lead teams and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses are especially encouraged to submit a response to this notice and should identify the business name and business size [large, small, 8(a), etc.].  Responses should comment on the firm's ability to meet the Section 508 requirement for accessibility of user controls, displays and interfaces. Responses to this request should be in the form of documents in the Microsoft Word format. Responses should be sent to the Contracting Officer, Lynda McCarthy, at lmccarthy@usgs.gov.  Responses are due no later than August 1, 2006.  All comments and suggestions will be seriously considered and, if appropriate and in the best interest of the government, may result in modifications to the above drafts before a Request For Proposal (RFP) is issued.

ISSUANCE DATE:	07/11/2006
CLOSING DATE/TIME:	4:30 pm Cairo time on 08/15/2006
POSITION TITLE:	Regional Middle East Democracy and Governance Senior Program Specialist
MARKET VALUE:	GS-14 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	2 years with possibility of extension. 
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/Cairo, Egypt
SECURITY ACCESS: 	Employment Authorization
AREA OF CONSIDERATION:	U.S. Citizens or U.S. resident aliens who are able to obtain the required security clearance.

Note: A candidate who is otherwise qualified, but does not meet full requirements of the position, may be appointed as a trainee and be required to serve at a lower grade level for the period of one year.

A. 	ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION:
Although the position requires extensive travel to the Middle East, the incumbent residence will be in Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is the largest city in Africa and the Middle East.  It has a number of urban problems such as severe pollution, and traffic congestion.  However, it is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites, and most sports.  The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are easily reachable and provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba diving.


B.	POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR:
The Regional Middle East Democracy and Governance Senior Program Specialist will be supervised by, and will report to, the Supervisory General Development Officer of the OMEP office (Office of Middle East Programs) at USAID/Cairo, Egypt.

C.	OVERVIEW:
The new regional Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP) in the U.S. Agency for International Development, Egypt Mission (USAID/Egypt) is soliciting applications from qualified individuals to serve as the regional Middle East Democracy and Governance (DG) Senior Program Specialist.  Promoting democratic processes and good governance is a crucial challenge in the Middle East and North Africa region, and a priority goal of U.S. foreign policy.  In the past several decades, some reforms in democracy and governance have happened across the region. However, progress throughout the region is halting, and not inclusive.  The region suffers from limited popular participation in the political process and often from poor, unaccountable governance.  Many of the tactics to address problems of governance, weak democratic institutions and processes are bilateral in nature.  At the same time, a regional approach across USAID presence and non-presence countries is necessary for some efforts, such as sharing of Arabic based resources between bilateral programs and strengthening and establishing transnational associations, including professional associations and institutions that can help combat corruption and weak governance.  Further, helping national institutions to use better common practices should promote the transparency and good governance that serves as an incentive to investment and leads to social and political stability.  USAID pursues regional approaches to DG in order to further a main U.S. objective of mitigating conflict and promoting the culture of democracy in the Middle East.  OMEP’s role in carrying out these goals is to address transnational issues and opportunities, promote public-private partnerships, facilitate the exchange of information and ideas between countries, and engage multilateral institutions.  OMEP’s strategy will focus on the main components of youth, water, and DG.  Democracy and governance activities may include regional anti-corruption efforts, providing a forum for sharing of Arabic language best practices, and strengthening regional associations to combat bad governance. 

The Middle East DG Senior Program Specialist provides strategic and policy guidance and specialized technical assistance, and serves as a project/activity manager with OMEP, located within the USAID/Egypt Mission.  The position ensures timely and effective implementation of a portfolio of activities in support of the overall USAID regional strategy for the Middle East.  This position has the unique role of designing and establishing a strategy for the regional democracy program under USAID’s first regional Strategy for the Middle East and North Africa, covering USAID presence and non-presence countries, and starting-up a new portfolio of regional activities and technical assistance.  The incumbent will be required to maintain close coordination with the USAID bilateral missions in the Middle East, notably, in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, West Bank/Gaza, and Yemen, as well as coordination with USAID/Washington’s Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and Bureau for Asia and the Near East (ANE), in order to collaborate on the design of regional activities, as well as the dissemination of information and expertise throughout the region. 

In addition to close coordination within USAID, the Middle East DG Senior Program Specialist will serve as a counterpart in the field to the USG agencies and actors working on DG in the Middle East and North Africa. The incumbent will provide expertise and strategic and policy guidance on democracy and governance in the Middle East. The incumbent will be required to develop a comprehensive understanding of all donor DG activities throughout the region, including USAID non-presence countries such as Libya and Syria.  Incumbent will coordinate with the Department of State’s (DOS) Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) staff along with USAID/DCHA and ANE staff who regularly contribute to MEPI coordination efforts.  The regional Middle East DG Senior Program Specialist may serve as project manager for several MEPI activities.

The DG Senior Program Specialist would report to the OMEP Director.

<DESC>Background:
The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) has a requirement to establish an Earned Value Management (EVM) process for both developmental and steady-state projects.

Statement of Need:
This notice is issued by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), an organization of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), as a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit responses from interested parties.  The OCIO is seeking sources able to establish an EVM program that will enable the OCIO and Project Managers (PMs) to assess the cost and performance of projects and track project deficiencies.  Additionally, the Offeror will provide guidance and assistance to the Project Managers in the use of EVM and will monitor and track EVM corrective actions.  

This notice, which is for information and planning purposes only, allows industry the opportunity to provide feedback on their ideas for the provision of services noted above.  This document will also verify reasonableness and feasibility of future program requirements and promote competition.  DOT intends to establish and implement EVM as soon as feasible and is looking for a single Offeror that can provide solutions and support for the issues listed below. 

This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by DOT, nor will DOT pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments.  No awards will be issued as a result of this RFI.  However, the information received through this RFI will be utilized to assist in formulating future requirements and an implementation strategy for Earned Value Management within the OCIO of the DOT.  A part of that strategy will include other competitive procurements, such as obtaining the actual EVM solution. 

Issues to be Addressed:
The Offeror must address the following items:

•	Establish an Earned Value Management (EVM) Program within DOT
The Offeror must be able to provide detailed information regarding its capabilities in being able to establish an effective program of Earned Value Management (EVM) for both developmental and steady-state projects.  The EVM Program must be structured to allow the OCIO and Project Managers (PMs) to assess cost and performance of projects.  The Offeror must be able to provide guidance to and work with the PMs in the use of EVM.  The Offeror will monitor and track corrective actions.  The EVM program must be consistent with the DOT’s strategic plan and OMB directives.  

•	Define the Required Tools
The Offeror must provide detailed information regarding its capabilities to identify the applicable EVM tools that will be required in order to achieve the desired EVM results.  

•	Training of DOT Personnel on the Use of EVM
The Offeror must provide detailed information regarding its capabilities to provide general oversight and training of staff on the use and purpose of EVM to ensure its proper interpretation and use within the DOT.

•	Price and Timeline Information
The Offeror must provide a rough order of magnitude price for each of the items listed above and provide pricing assumptions along with a proposed time frame for the accomplishment of those items.  

Responses must also include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; average annual revenue for the past three (3) years and number of employees; ownership; whether large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, Veteran, Service Disabled Veteran, and/or Woman Owned; whether the Offeror is on GSA Schedule; number of years in business; list of customers covering the past three years. (Highlight relevant work performed).

In summary, the OCIO within the DOT requires the establishment of an Earned Value Management Program that will be complementary to and in support of OMB directives.

This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and DOT does not presently intend to award a contract at this time.  As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  DOT does not intend to pay for information furnished in response hereto.  DOT reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. 

Sources interested in this requirement should send all relevant commercial literature (e.g., description of the services and products offered, specifications, price lists, etc.) and any other necessary information that demonstrates the above requirements can be met.  Information should be submitted by October 14, 2005 via electronic mail to sherrill.king@dot.gov and rhonda.robinson@dot.gov.  

PLEASE REPLY AND CONFIRM RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL MESSAGE.

Sincerely,
Sherrill S. King

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION (OST)
	
PROGRAM TITLE:  DOT-WIDE RECORDS MANAGEMENT APPLICATION - PHASE 2 

Name:  Rhonda Robinson, Contracting Officer, DOT, OST
Organization:  Acquisition Services
Region:  DOT Headquarters 
Phone Number:  202-366-6689
Email:  Rhonda.robinson@dot.gov
Date:  August 3, 2005
Industry Reponses Due by:  August 31, 2005
Procurement Method:  Public Announcement

Introduction:
The United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) is seeking Records Management Application products.  With this Request For Information (RFI), the OST is seeking Commercial Records Management Application providers assistance in providing information that the DOT may utilize to support the scanning, indexing, storage and  migration of paper records, for DOT-wide implementation, business solution and/or investment decision. 

Background:
The DOT is planning a move to a new Headquarters Building, and as part of a department-wide consolidation process, DOT plans to convert substantial portions of its paper records into an electronic format.  

Statement of Need:
This notice is issued by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), an organization of the DOT OST, as an RFI to solicit responses from interested parties. The OCIO is seeking sources with the ability to recommend and implement a strategy that provides for the identification, evaluation, recommendation, purchase, installation, operation, and support of a Department-wide Records Management Application (RMA) for DOT. 

This notice is for information and planning purposes only, with the intent to allow industry the opportunity to provide feedback on their ideas for the provision of services described below.  This document will also verify reasonableness and feasibility of future program requirements and promote competition.  DOT intends to install 3,500 seats with the RMA over a three (3) year period, 2000 in the first year, and 750 in years two and three.  The 2000 seats and associated services must be in place by February 2007.  DOT is looking for a single Offeror that can provide solutions and support for the issues listed below.  

This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by DOT, nor will DOT pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments. No awards will be issued as a result of this RFI. However, the information received through this RFI will be utilized to assist in formulating future requirements and an implementation strategy for DOT Records Management program.  A part of that strategy will include other competitive procurements, such as obtaining the actual RMA solution. 

Therefore, the DOT is interested in commercial RMA providers’ review, comments and input on the following: 

Issues to be Addressed:
The Offeror must address the following items:

•	Solicitation/Procurement Document Preparation
The Offeror must identify and state the technical requirements and specifications of DOT pursuant to the process of the preparation and issuance of procurement documents that will allow prospective vendors to respond by offering an appropriate RMA solution.  The Offeror must document the process by which the technical requirements of DOT were determined and incorporated into said procurement documents.  A portion of this task will require the identification of the functional requirements of the several DOT Operating Administrations (OAs) for the Department-wide RMA, as well as the incorporation of related information already obtained by DOT.  The RMA must comply with  DOD 5015.2-STD, and the requirements of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and be consistent with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) for DOT.

•	Solicitation Response Evaluation and Recommendation to DOT for RMA  Acquisition
The Offeror must provide a documented methodology for evaluation of responses received resulting from the above referenced procurement consistent with the needs of DOT as stated in the procurement documents, and make a recommendation to the OCIO, based on all relevant documentation, for acquiring a specific Department-wide RMA solution. The Offeror should provide an estimated cost for the acquisition of the RMA solution, and an explanation of the underlying assumptions that form the basis for stating that price.  A portion of this task will require the Offeror to arrange for and evaluate demonstrations of how the proposed RMA solutions will operate based upon certain work flows of the several DOT OAs.  Moreover, the proposed RMA solution must be consistent with the Enterprise Architecture for DOT and will be reviewed by members of that DOT office prior to purchase or implementation.  The Offeror must not be associated with any RMA solution in any sense that would constitute a conflict of interest by limiting the ability of the Offeror to fairly and objectively evaluate all potential RMA solution proposed.


•	Implementation and Support of Selected RMA
The Offeror must manage and support the chosen RMA in terms of its initial installation onto DOT servers and the DOT network, and in terms of its on-going operation.  A portion of this task will require the identification of work flows of the several DOT OAs for input into the Department-wide RMA, as well as the incorporation of related information already obtained by DOT.  Support for the RMA solution must be integrated into the DOT Information Technology Services support system
	
•	Integration of Selected Records Management Application with Existing Applications
The Offeror must integrate existing Records Management, Document Management, and Content Management applications already in use at DOT, and the contents thereof, into the Department-wide RMA.  Existing applications at DOT may include, but are not limited to, Identitiech, Hummingbird, Documentum, Filenet, and/or Zylabs.  The RMA solution must be compatible with and integrated into the Microsoft Office Suite/Outlook products.  

•	Training of DOT Personnel on Use of the Selected Records Management Application
The Offeror must address the management and support of the provision of training for DOT personnel in the usage of the Department-wide RMA.

•	Loading of Scanned Images
The Offeror must manage and support the loading of scanned images into the Department-wide RMA.  Pursuant to the effort at records reduction, DOT has issued a solicitation for scanning and it is anticipated that the OAs may have several million images of records scanned by the time the RMA is selected.  Those images may be in TIFF, PDF, etc. formats, may be documents with or without OCR, and may or may not be indexed.  While the terms of the scanning procurement will require the vendor providing that service to assist with the loading of the images into the RMA solution that DOT eventually implements, the Offeror here should anticipate a primary role in loading those legacy records into the RMA solution, and provide for loading of newly created records on a “Day 1 Forward” basis.  Consequently, the Offeror must consider the issues of loading and indexing existing records into the selected RMA solution.
 
•	Price and Timeline Information
The Offeror must provide a rough order of magnitude price for each of the items listed above, and provide pricing assumptions along with a proposed time frame for the accomplishment of those items.  As noted above, DOT expects to install the 3,500 seats over a three year period.  As such, the Offeror should provide the rough order of magnitude pricing for each item and the yearly cost for that item over each year of the three year period.  As an example, if the Offeror states “Training” at $4,000 dollars, what would be the cost for Year 1, how much for Year 2, and how much for Year 3?  

Responses must also include the following:  Name and address of firm, size of business using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; average annual revenue for the past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, Veteran, Service Disabled Veteran, and/or Women Owned; whether the Offeror is on GSA Schedule; number of years in business; list of customers covering the past three years. (Highlight relevant work performed).

In summary, the Department-wide RMA must accommodate input, storage, and indexing of a variety of records types, allow for secure authorized access and retrieval of those records based on complex metadata that reflects the business needs of DOT’s modes and offices, must be compatible with similar applications already in use or implemented by DOT modes and offices, must be acceptable to the NARA, and be DOD 5015.2 compliant.

SECURITY NOTICE:
1.	Work under contract may involve access to sensitive information which shall not be disclosed by the contractor unless authorized by the contracting officer.  To protect sensitive information, the contractor shall provide training to any contractor employee authorized access to sensitive information and, upon request of the Government, provide information as to an individual’s suitability to have such authorization.  Contractor employees found by the Government to be unsuitable or whose employment is deemed contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security, may be prevented from performing work under the particular contract when requested by the contracting officer. 
2.

3.	The contractor shall include the above requirements in any subcontract awarded involving access to Government facilities, sensitive information, and/or resources.
4.	Contractor Responsible for IT Services:  The contactor shall be responsible for IT security for all systems operated by or connected to a DOT network, regardless of location.  This includes any IT resource or services in which the contractor has physical or electronic access to DOT’s sensitive information that directly supports the mission of DOT (e.g. hosting DOT e-government sites or other IT operations).  If necessary, the Government shall have access to contractor and any subcontractor facilities, systems/networks operated on behalf of DOT, documentation, databases, and personnel to carry out a program of IT information (to include vulnerability scanning), investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to DOT data or IT systems.
5.	Within 30 days of contract award, the contractor shall develop and provide to the Government for approval, an IT Security Plan which describes the processes and procedures the contractor will follow in performance of said contract to ensure the appropriate security of IT resources developed, processed, or used under said contract.  This Plan shall be written and implemented in accordance with applicable Federal laws stipulated in the reference section above.
6.	The contractor shall screen their personnel requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to systems operated by the contractor for DOT or interconnected to a DOT network in accordance with DOT Order 1630.2B, Personnel Security Management and ensure contractor employees are trained annually in accordance with OMB Circular A-130, Federal Information Security Management Act, and NIST requirements with specific emphasis on rules of behavior.  This requirement shall also be included in any subcontract award for IT services.
7.	The contractor shall ensure DOT IT security baseline standards are applied to all IT systems developed and/or maintained by the contractor.


Applicable Conditions:
This acquisition meets critical timing constraints dictated by requirements inherent to moving into the new Headquarters building and avoidance of added cost by the Government.  

This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and DOT does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.   DOT does not intend to pay for information furnished in response hereto.  DOT reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.

Description:  Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Program Office – San Antonio, and the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal for the Privatization of Military Family Housing for the AETC Group II project on or about 14 July 2006. The AETC Group II project consists of six bases: Columbus AFB, MS; Goodfellow AFB, TX; Laughlin AFB, TX; Maxwell AFB, AL; Randolph AFB, TX; and Vance AFB, OK. Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a one-step RFP process. In their proposals, each prospective Offeror (or Offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources, financial strategy, and a description of its technical approach to the AETC Group II project as described in the RFP. Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Highest Ranking Offeror (HRO) to the Air Force. The HRO will then begin negotiations with the Air Force and complete additional remaining submittal requirements needed for closing the real estate transaction.  These additional submittal requirements are also identified in the RFP. The AETC Group II project is a real estate transaction to privatize 2,338 military family housing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 2,338 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years. The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,530 housing units, primary and secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the Project Owner (PO). The Government may subsidize the project's financing as described in the RFP. The PO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the AETC Group II family housing inventory. Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the PO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the PO. This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Request for Proposal is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

<SUBJECT>A -- Clinical Site Monitoring Project
<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to extend the current contract N01-AI-05405 with Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) for 36 months until December 31, 2009 under Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), Unique Capabilities.  The Clinical Site Monitoring Project is designed to meet the needs of NIAID by conducting on-site monitoring, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Training, and quality management consultation for the following networks or major study sites of the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the Acute Infection Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the NIAID Vaccine Research Center (VRC), the ESPRIT and SMART studies, the Comprehensive International Program for Research on AIDS (CIPRA) and a host of other investigator initiated non-network based clinical trials.  The NIAID, as the funding agency for trials conducted by these groups, must provide oversight under Title 45 CFR 46, and when DAIDS holds the Investigational New Drug (IND) application Title 21 CFR 50 & 56 which deals with the protection of human subjects in research. The current contractor monitors or audits in 50 countries, at 900 sites on over 300 active protocols. Their primary role is to help DAIDS ensure that the rights and well-being of trial participants are protected and that the data collected during the course of a study is complete and accurate. They do this by monitoring adherence to the protocols, the reporting of adverse experiences, and by conducting audits of the regulatory files and pharmacies.  Several types of assessment visits may be conducted including site initiation, interim site visits, closeout visits, quality management consultation visits and special assignment visits. Additionally, sites may request GCP training, source document and essential document training, and may choose from several other training modules that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the trial sites.  
Currently, PPD conducts monitoring in more than 50 countries at over 900 clinical trial sites on more than 300 protocols.  With more than 40 offices worldwide they have been able to quickly move into even the most remote areas.  Additionally, on-site monitoring of NIAID sponsored studies is both a regulatory responsibility as well as a moral obligation in order to ensure that the safety and well being of study subjects is protected.  PPD currently has a highly experienced staff of well-trained monitors already working in or able to travel to the designated countries and are well positioned to begin additional monitoring as needed.  There is already a fully validated system in place for collecting, verifying and reporting of monitoring results by site.  Management systems are in place for frequent conference calls for the program officers responsible for each of the networks to discuss on-going issues related to the monitoring effort.    PPD has many years experience in monitoring these DAIDS funded networks and can immediately expand their work on this project to accomplish unique monitoring tasks as they arise.

As more and more sites are added we continue to have an urgent need for on-going training on evolving DAIDS policies and procedures, Good Clinical Practice, Federal Regulations, and Human Subjects Protections.  Adequate training in all aspects of clinical trials research is the key to ensuring consistency in results from multiple sites around the globe.  PPD has provided these training activities as needed in resource limited environments and has worked with DAIDS staff to develop a “train the trainer” program to address on-going and future needs.  In summary, DAIDS recognizes that the PPD monitoring and training group has the unique capabilities to immediately implement the necessary activities at new sites without unacceptable delays. Additionally, with on-going studies at more than 900 sites there is a need for continuous monitoring and training activities.  PPD is currently the only monitoring/training contractor to perform these services for the DAIDS funded networks listed above and they can continue this activity without any lost time or negative impact to the on-going trials.  To introduce a new contractor for this period of time to perform these substantial and critical activities could jeopardize the safety of clinical trial participants and delay the success of new treatments and interventions for the prevention of HIV/AIDS.  It would not be in the best interest of NIAID/DAIDS to interrupt or delay monitoring and training in these challenging environments in the developing world.  In addition, solicitation and negotiation with a new source would take approximately 18 months or more and would result in unacceptable delays in ongoing NIAID research efforts.  It is estimated that a new contractor would result in a duplication of funds for start-up, hiring, training, development and validation of the necessary albeit temporary monitoring database, SOP generation and approval, and other systems requirements.  The costs associated with these and other various start-up activities would be in excess of $1,000,000, would not be recovered through competition and would result in a significant and unacceptable delay in required activities.  Additionally, this extension would allow time for the completion of the restructuring of the DAIDS funded networks and awarding of the new grants for clinical trial sites.  It would also allow sufficient time for completion of the requirements for the interface with the DAIDS ES.  In turn, this would permit the development of a more complete and accurate Scope of Work for the next re-competition of the monitoring contract which would allow a more level playing field for offerors.   Therefore, no other service will satisfy Agency requirements.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting their interest and a capability statement demonstrating their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of costs and effort.  See Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<SUBJECT>R -- Modification to Contract HHSA290200500019C
<DESC>Modification to Contract HHSA290200500019C - The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) currently has a sole-source contract with The Advertising Council to develop a public awareness campaign on patient empowerment to help AHRQ reach the goal of promoting patient safety issues and encouraging consumers to be more active in their health care.  The primary audience for this public service ad campaign is all caregivers using our Nation’s health care system for themselves or their families.  Continuing in this direction, AHRQ would like to extend the messages in the current patient empowerment campaign and specifically target other key audiences that have a great need for this type of information – older Americans and minorities.  Therefore, AHRQ intends to modify this sole-source contract to accomplish this goal.  The current contractor’s niche and uniqueness is its ability to reach out to decision makers at each media property by delivering individual media kits describing the sponsor’s message with a specific request to donate media time or space.  The Advertising Council is the unique organization designated by the advertising industry to present its public service advertising and communications industry.  There is no other known source offering the full range of public service campaign services nationwide.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract modification based on responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions or responses to this notice should be directed to the Contracting Officer at Sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov no later than July 25, 2006.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>--Intent to increase programmatic ordering capacity for Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR)
<DESC>The U. S. Army Engineering & Support Center, Huntsville, Alabama, intends to award modifications increasing the programmatic ordering capacity of current contracts for Facility Repair and rehabilitation in support of Governmental installations and fa cilities throughout the United States, POC Charles D. Miller, (256)-895-1399, Contracting Officer or Donna L. Parker (256)-895-1241, Contracting Officer.  Description: The U. S. Army Engineering & Support Center, Huntsville, intends to modify the current c ontracts by increasing the programmatic ordering capacity by $66,000,000.00 to provide facility repair and rehabilitation at various facilities throughout the United States.  The services to be provided under this modification will remain consistent with t he Scope of Work and nature of the original statement of work for contracts: DACA87-02-D-0035 BMAR , DACA87-03-D-0004 RCI, DACA87-03-D-0005 Global Engineering, DACA87-03-D-0006 Vanguard Contractors, DACA87-03-D-0007 Ameresco.  The existing contracts were a warded under full and open competition and provided for the issuance of firm-fixed price and time and material task orders.  The current programmatic capacity was based upon our projections for customer requirements at the time. It is now clear that the po tential magnitude of programmatic support was far greater than our projections at the time of contract planning and award.  There is no way this office could have foreseen the drastic increase in requirements that have occurred in the current year, due in large part to Hurricane Katrina recovery support.  This office is currently involved in the pre-solicitation phase to award replacement contracts.  The acquisition strategy for the programmatic support contracts will provide multiple award IDIQ contracts t o cover five years.  However, for this specific request, the unique, prior experience and involvement of the current contractors, the need for facility repairs and renovations, and the requirement for modification of existing task orders, the authority 10 U.S.C. 230 4(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 6.302-1 is applicable:  Only one reasonable source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements and award to any other source would result in (a) substantial duplic ation of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or (b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement.  Due to the unique, prior experience and involvement of the current contractors, the need for facili ty repairs and renovations and the requirement for modification of existing task orders, the sole source award (modification to increase the programmatic ordering capacity) to the current contractors, is justified because to do otherwise would result in su bstantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays.  This notice is not a formal solicitation.  The synopsis of intent to award a sole source is not a request for proposal (RFP).  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in p reparation of response to this sources sought announcement.  The Offerors who can demonstrate the necessary experience and expertise and who can provide the U. S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, with the above services in the time frame re quired and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government, are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response which includes pricing, to include profit rate, overhead rate, G&A rate, project management and support personnel rates, ability to self-perform work, layers of subcontracting and associated mark-ups, and any information indicating a bona fide ability to meet these specific requirements.  All responsible sources may respond to this synopsis, and all such responses will be considered  by the agency.  Written responses should include business size.  NAICS 236220 Commercial & Institutional Building Construction.  The small business size standa rd is $31 million.  If no written responses from well-qualified sources are received within fifteen (15) calendar days, a modification will be awarded.  Written inquiries may be e-mailed to charles.d.miller@usace.army.mil or donna.l.parker@usace.army.mil o r directed to Charles D. Miller, Contracting Officer, Fax No. (256)-895-1141.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: Dell Laptop computers are required to provide the reliability and functionality required by the Office of Overseas Building Operations.  The equipment is for use in the OBO Community and is used by multiple personnel constantly.  Dell is one of the main computer equipment manufacturers and is known for reliability, functionality, cost effectiveness and maintainability improved through R&D. OBO/IM/NOMB has diligently researched three major computer companies with the following criteria - Cost, reliability, CPU speed, CPU manufacturer, CPU configuration, memory, memory expansion, bus speed, video memory, video speed, display size, display dps, weight (very important in laptops - varies greatly), maintainability (R&D), and reliability. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: The R&D portion is important as this saves man-hours in maintenance and repair times.  The Dell equipment is approved by Diplomatic Security for both for standalone use and for Main State SDI use.  If other than the specific dell laptop models required are procured, there will likely be functionality issues in various individual divisions which will result in the division procuring the equipment a second time to get the functionality and reliability they require.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1. COTRACTING ACTIVITY
Department of the Air Fort, 6th Contracting Squadron, 2606 Brown Pelican Ave, MacDill AFB, FL 33621-5000

2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING PROCESSED
This will be a firm fixed-price contract for two FireBERD 8000 bit error rate test sets exclusively manufactured and distributed by ACTERNA.

3. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS
6th Communications Squadron, 6 CS/SCBO 2405 Florida Keys, Bldg P40, Rm 120 MacDill AFB, FL 33621 needs to purchase two FireBERD 8000 bit error rate test sets to complete mandatory test and acceptance of telecommunications circuitry on Macdill AFB.  In addition the test set is a vital troubleshooting tool used daily in the base Network Operations Center to restore telecommunications outages. The current FireBERD 6000 test sets on hand are outdated and have exceeded their life expectancy.  They are also no longer supported by depot maintenance or the manufacturer for repair or replacement.

4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.
10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements."

5. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE BRAND'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF ONLY ONE PARTICULAR BRAND AUTHORITY.
The FireBERD 8000 bit error rate test set is uniquely designed to test long haul and dedicated user circuitry bit error rate.  It provides diagnostic testing necessary to ensure digital communications lines meet or exceed communications thresholds pre-determined and directed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).  No other piece of equipment satisfactorily provides the unique testing capabilities of the FireBERD 8000.  These test sets require no additional training for technicians as they are taught in the basic skills technical school for the Systems Control career field.

6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE.
I talked with Arnie Selnick from ACTERNA.  The FireBERD 8000 is only available directly from ACTERNA (the manufacturer) and is not sold to any other vendor for distribution.

7. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE
The Contracting Officer shall determine the price offered to be fair and reasonable through:
a. Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(i)).
b. Comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)).
c. Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(iv))
d. Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(v))
e. Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(vi))
f. Analysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(vi))
g. The CO's personal knowledge of the item being purchased.

8. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED.
The FireBERD 8000 is the standard test used in Air Force telecommunications facilities.  It performs unique bit error rate testing directed by the Defense Information Systems Agency.  The proposed test set is an "all in one" piece of equipment.  Other independent devices will perform independent functions of the FireBERD 8000 but purchasing multiple pieces of equipment to provide the same function would be much more costly.  Additional training would be required to support separate pieces of unknown equipment.

BACKGROUND:  The condition of coral reefs in the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas has dramatically declined and it is suspected that natural and/or anthropogenic stressors may be responsible

SCOPE:  The purpose of this effort is to apply geospatial and advanced statistical approaches to determine the relationship(s) among coral condition (e.g., bleaching, disease, abundance, diversity) and suspected natural and anthropogenic causes (e.g., temperature, ultraviolet radiation, water quality).  The relationships among each measure of coral condition and potential cause shall be statistically examined; all combinations of potential causes shall also be examined to determine which combination(s) provide the strongest relationship(s) with each measure of coral condition.

APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  The Contract Specialist will upon request of contractors provide an Excel Spread Sheet which displays an inventory of available data for completion of this scope of work.  The data are stored as electronic files in GIS layers or feature classes and include all metadata for the Florida Keys reef system required for the performance of this contract.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/TASK DESCRIPTIONS:  This procurement is for (a) the conduct of geostatistical and advanced statistical analyses of geospatial data on coral condition in the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas using stressor distributions provided by EPA, (b) interpretation of the results of the data analyses to distinguish which environmental factor, or combination of factors, best relate to the presence of coral and its condition, and (c) discussion and demonstration of the statistical analyses and approaches used in the analyses to EPA staff, during a 5-day period, onsite at the Gulf Ecology Division.

<DESC>TITLE:  A Study on the Role of Well-Designed Transportation Projects Enhancing Communities*

ACTION:  As prescribed by SAFETEA-LU, Section 1925 entitled “Community Enhancement Study,” this is a notice of availability of funding for transportation research under a program to encourage relationships among transportation, community, and system preservation plans and practices and identify private sector-based initiatives to improve such relationships.  The FHWA anticipants awarding one cost reimbursement contract of up to 16 months in duration and $2 million to a national organization representing architects who have expertise in the design of a wide range of transportation and infrastructure projects, which include the design of buildings, public facilities, and surrounding communities to conduct the study.*

SUMMARY:  The FHWA will fund transportation research to conduct a study on the role of well-designed transportation projects enhancing communities in:
1.	Promoting economic development;
2.	Protecting public health, safety and the environment; and
3.	Enhancing the architectural design and planning of communities; and the positive economic, cultural, aesthetic, scenic, architectural, and environmental benefits of such projects for communities.*  

The study shall address the following:
1.	The degree to which well-designed transportation projects have positive economic, cultural, aesthetic, scenic, architectural, and environmental benefits for communities.
2.	The degree to which such projects protect and contribute to improvements in public health and safety.
3.	The degree to which such projects use inclusive public participation processes to achieve quicker, more certain, and better results.
4.	The degree to which positive results are achieved by linking transportation, design, and the implementation of community visions for the future.
5.	Facilitating the use of successful models or best practices in transportation investment or development to accomplish each of the following:
a.	Enhancement of community identity.
b.	Protection of public health and safety.
c.	Provision of a variety of choices in housing, shopping, transportation, employment, and recreation.
d.	Preservation and enhancement of existing infrastructure.
e.	Creation of a greater sense of community through public involvement.*

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Responses submitted for this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) must adhere to the format and content instructions set forth below. These instructions have been specifically tailored to the process and the evaluation criteria to be applied during proposal evaluation. Failure to submit any of the information requested by this BAA may be cause for unfavorable consideration. Any inconsistencies between the various sections of an Offeror’s response must be fully explained. A significant inconsistency, if unexplained, may raise a fundamental question of the Offeror’s understanding of the work required, and ability to perform the contract.*

The Offeror’s response should demonstrate their understanding of this procurement and capability for performance in a concise, logical manner and should not contain superfluous material, which is not directly related to this procurement.*

The Government will process late submissions of proposals in accordance with FAR 52.215-1. If a proposal is received late and is not eligible for consideration, then the Government will reject that proposal without evaluation.*

BUDGET/COST PROPOSAL

The total value of the award will not exceed $2,000,000 as follows: $1,600,000 basic requirement + $400,000 option.*

The budget for the basic requirement is $1,600,000.  All Offerors shall propose to complete the required deliverables as specified below within this budget.*  

FHWA acknowledges that requests for special studies could arise during the course of this effort.  Therefore, an optional financial set aside is available to support such analysis.  Each Offeror shall propose an unburdened plug number of $400,000 as a line item in the cost proposal entitled “Special Studies.” The Special Studies option may be exercised at the Government’s discretion and negotiated with the contractor during the course of this effort.*

NOTE: Cost sharing is encouraged.  Proposals may exceed the basic requirement budget ceiling and total budget ceiling if the additional resources are proposed as cost share.  Any cost share shall be included in detail in the Cost proposal.* 

DELIVERABLES

At a minimum, the Offeror shall provide the following deliverables.  The Offeror is not limited to these deliverables, and may elect to propose additional deliverables as part of their proposal.* 

The Contractor shall provide quarterly status reports to the Government providing an increasingly detailed outline of the Community Enhancement Study, including research undertaken and proposed for each 3-month period of the task.  The Government will meet with the Contractor at 4-month intervals to discuss progress on the study and to assess the need for “Special Studies.”  These meetings may occur via telephone, videoconference, or in person.  The Contractor will provide at the end of the contract a final report detailing the findings from the Community Enhancement Study.*

 The Contractor shall provide all report deliverables in camera-ready hard copy and an electronic copy in Microsoft Office 2000 or equivalent on a CD-ROM(s). In addition, electronic files containing the word processing, graphic, and table data may be required as deliverables. The Contractor shall establish electronic file transfer capabilities such that correspondence and deliverables can be communicated electronically to the FHWA Program Office.*

All products submitted under this announcement become the property of FHWA and may be disseminated or used for government purposes subsequent to the completion of the work.  The developer of the material also may have continued incidental use of the products for the purpose of additional research or marketing but may not sell or offer the products without prior approval of FHWA.*

REPORTING

The Contractor shall submit a brief monthly report until the work is completed.  The report should describe in brief (e.g. in outline format) work completed the prior month, work anticipated in the upcoming month, approximate percent of work completed and approximate amount of resources expended.*    

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS

Each proposals shall include:

1.	The full name, address, point of contact, a telephone number, fax number and an electronic mail address for the organization.
2.	A detailed description of proposed work describing
a.	Need or problem statement (1 page)
b.	Technical approach (30 pages) 
c.	Past performance relevant to current proposal with points of contact (up to two pages and may include references to readily accessible documents)
3.	The period of performance (time line) for the work and submission of deliverables (up to one page);
4.	Tailored biographies of key staff including relevant expertise (1 page for each key researcher and 1 page (inclusive) for all other staff);

6.	A cost proposal indicating staffing levels, hours, hard costs for the total project and amount of funding expected from FHWA (Not To Exceed $2,000,000 in Federal funding).*

DATES:  Please be aware that the security procedures in the Nassif Building prohibit individuals from delivering material directly to offices in the building. Individuals visiting the building must report to the southwest guard station at the Nassif Building. All materials left there will be examined and x-rayed before being delivered to Room 4410 through the normal internal mail delivery procedures. As this can take up to several working days, offerors must make allowances to assure that proposals arrive in Room 4410 by 4:00 p.m. on January 16, 2006. Proposals received after the due date and time will be considered late in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.*

If so requested, the guard will call the Acquisition Office (x66714) to have someone come down and accept the material once it has been examined. Offers must be received and date/time stamped in Room 4410 by the prescribed date and time to be considered timely, not just delivered to the guard station, the Nassif mailroom or loading dock. While we will do our best to accommodate such requests, FHWA is not responsible if someone is not immediately available to pick up your proposal.*

Further, please be advised that all of our mail (items handled by the US Postal Service) is sent out of town for scanning and irradiation prior to delivery to this building. This process can take several days, so even if you mailed us something from across the street, it may be a week before it actually arrives here. FedEx and United Parcel Service do have direct access to the building and offices. Please keep these factors in mind as you determine the best means to deliver your proposal so as to ensure delivery in room 4410 by no later than 4:00 PM (local time).*

Submittals must be printed hard copies consisting of one original and four copies along with one electronic copy on CD-ROM.*

CONTRACT TYPE:  FHWA anticipates awarding one cost reimbursement type contract.*

ADDRESSES:  Proposals must be delivered to Christian Hellie in the FHWA Office of Acquisition Management, 400 7th Street, S.W., Room 4410, Washington, DC 20590 (Mail Stop HAAM-30E).  Please not that current security procedures may result in delays of USPS mail delivery.* 

For further information about the Community Enhancement Study, please contact Kenneth Petty in the FHWA Office of Planning at 202-366-6654 or kenneth.petty@fhwa.dot.gov.*   

EVALUATION GENERAL

The Government will award a contract to an acceptable Offeror who is the best overall value, basing its source selection decisions on three factors – Technical, Cost/Price, and Business Factors  among the competing offerors.
	
1.	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s best interest.

2.	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

3.	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

4.	A cost realism analysis may be performed, and the source selection authority may consider cost realism in evaluating performance or schedule risk.*

To be considered for award, as prescribed in SAFETEA-LU, SEC. 1925, the Offeror must be a national organization representing architects who have expertise in the design of a wide range of transportation and infrastructure projects, which include the design of buildings, public facilities, and surrounding communities.  Proposals from Offerors who do not meet this criterion will not be evaluated and not considered for award.*

The Government will evaluate the qualified competing offers on the basis of the following factors:

A)	TECHNICAL IMPORTANCE AND INNOVATION (listed in descending order of importance) 
1)	Alignment with planning program and Agency research goals 
2)	Justification of need or problem identification
3)	Realistic work plan and technical approach/ Demonstrated likelihood of successful completion
4)	Demonstration of necessary facilities and equipment to successfully perform the work
5)	Clear identification of a specific audience or audiences*


B)	COST/PRICE (listed in descending order of importance)
1)	A relative reasonableness and realism to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work 
2)	Overall value of deliverables in support of FHWA planning research*

BASIS FOR AWARD
The Government will accept the offeror that is considered the best value and most advantageous to the Government. Of the three evaluation factors, Technical importance and innovation, Cost/Price and Business Factors, Technical is more important than Cost. Business factors are of less importance than Technical or Cost. As the ratings of competing Offerors approach being essentially equivalent in any of the three areas, the remaining areas will become more important in the selection decision.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote, solicitation number SP3100-6191-9502.  This requirement is set aside for small business; the associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334310 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.
The Defense Distribution Center located in New Cumberland, PA has a requirement for a contractor to furnish and install an Audio/Visual Presentation System in the Command Control Center (CCC) Conference Room located in Building 81.  
Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for the contract line items as follows: clin 0001, Equipment -- Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination, New Cumberland, PA); clin 0002, Installation of equipment; clin 0003, one year warranty and preventative maintenance; clin 0004 (optional), second year preventative maintenance.  Note: Desired schedule for delivery and installation is 3 weeks ARO; Required schedule for delivery and installation is 4 weeks ARO.

The Scope of Work for this requirement is as follows:
The CCC conference room is approximately 28-feet long by 20-feet wide and is a SECURE ROOM (controlled access).  A 4-foot X 10-foot conference table and 10 chairs are positioned in the center of the room.  Current equipment in the room includes a white board, with three separate sliding panels, comprising most of one wall; six computer desktop workstations located along two adjacent walls; a SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) communications (email) network system, linking the 6 computer workstations previously identified to their respective (SIPR/NIPR) Local Area Networks (LAN); a wall-mounted 19-inch television (which will need to be removed by the Contractor before installation of the new AV equipment) connected to a Cable TV network and a ceiling-mounted visual projector that faces a retractable projection screen along the same wall as the sliding dry-erase white boards noted above.  Ideally, amongst other functionality, the added audio/video display capability being requested in this SOW will supersede (replace) the need to utilize the current video projection and supporting retractable screen currently being employed in the CCC.  There are numerous power outlets throughout the space. The conference room has a standard 8-foot drop ceiling.  A schematic of the space is available from the Contract Specialist POC.
Government responsibilities:
1. Provide access to necessary areas to complete the project during normal business hours (0800 – 1700 M-F)
2. Provide a safe and clean environment for contractor employees and their subcontractors.
3. Provide computer network system, both SECURE and NON-SECURE, to have video display equipment interfaced to.
4. Provide cable TV network to have video display equipment interfaced to.
5. Provide 110V power supply for the following equipment being installed by the contractor

Contractor responsibilities:
The contractor shall provide the capability for the Command Control Center (CCC) to visually display on three separate contractor-provided and installed 60-inch (or larger) plasma monitors, information and or video from existing computer network systems, SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) systems and from an existing cable TV network.  Capability to display this information by these three plasma monitors must also include the ability to display multiple-source data into one plasma monitor simultaneously (minimum of two and maximum of four (quad) displays per monitor) and the ability to switch sources feeding these the monitors instantaneously.  It is anticipated that two of these plasma monitors would be located along the wall where the current retractable projection screen is located and the third screen would be located along a different wall within the same space. Each monitor must also have audio capability (integrated or as a separate speaker system)
The contractor shall also provide the CCC capability to add up to six additional computer workstations at the CCC Conference table, by providing the necessary computer network (both NIPR and SIPR) interface connections, to allow for a “plug and play” type capability and for these added workstations to also be able to feed information and have it displayed to the three plasma monitors, with the same level of functionality as previously described for the already existing computer network workstations. The overarching concept is that a laptop could be placed onto the conference room table and quickly and easily be “plugged” into the existing LANs, and removed just as effortlessly.  
The contractor will provide two audio/visual control systems.  One will be a movable desktop control panel, with the intention of it being used at the conference table, when needed. The second control system will be integrated with a portable podium. The podium should be easily movable (wheels or extremely light weight and be of standard size and configuration. Both systems should be capable of operating independently or in tandem (simultaneously).   
Specific audio/video equipment recommended to be provided and installed by the contractor to achieve the required added functionality includes, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Three 60 inch plasma data display screens (or larger), with a minimum 1024x768 resolution, with depth dimension not to exceed 6 inches, capable of being wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted. Each monitor must also include audio output capability. 
2. Combination S-VHS Hi-Fi VCR/DVD player. Only special requirement for this equipment is that it can be stored properly in equipment rack also to be provided by the contractor.
3. Two portable video control panels.  One suitable for desktop mounting, the other to be part of a portable podium system. 
4. Portable podium with attached/installed video control panel.  Due to size of CCC Conference room, there is no need for a microphone with this podium.  The podium should be easily movable, either on wheels or extremely light weight and be of standard size and configuration 
5. Equipment rack (if required), to house VCR/DVD player, switcher, and any other associated equipment. 
6. Required interfaces, control system, remotes, power switches, switch boxes, cables, connectors and other mounting brackets to install all items identified above.
7. Required interfaces and hardware to support capability of integrating additional six computer workstations on the conference room table, when needed (plug and play) to the existing computer network (NIPR and SIPR).
8. One year warranty and preventive maintenance on entire audio visual system installed by the contractor.
9. Second year preventative maintenance. 
Contractor shall install the audio visual system.  Contractor shall ensure full integration with VTC equipment.  Contractor shall test and align the system.  Labor and programming will include all on-site installation and wiring, coordination and supervision, testing, checkout and training.  Also includes all fabrication, modification, assembly, rack wiring and programming.  All items that are mounted must be able to be remounted if equipment must be relocated in the future to another room.
A site visit will be conducted on Monday, July 17, 2006 at 01:00 PM EDT (1300 EDT).  Contractors interested in attending must provide the following information to the Contract Specialist POC no later than 12:00 PM EDT (1200 EDT) on Thursday, July 13, 2006:
	- Company Name

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:  Dell desktop computers are required to provide the reliability and functionality required by the Office of Overseas Building Operations.  The equipment is for use in the OBO Community and is used by multiple personnel constantly.  Dell is one of the main computer equipment manufacturers and is known for reliability, functionality, cost effectiveness and maintainability improved through R&D. OBO/IM/NOMB has diligently researched three major computer companies with the following criteria - Cost, reliability, CPU speed, CPU manufacturer, CPU configuration, memory, memory expansion, bus speed, video memory, video speed, display size, display dps, ), maintainability (R&D), and reliability. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: The R&D portion is important as this saves man-hours in maintenance and repair times.  The Dell equipment is approved by Diplomatic Security for both for standalone use and for Main State SDI use.  If other than the specific Dell desktops required are procured, there will likely be functionality issues in various individual divisions which will result in the division procuring the equipment a second time to get the functionality and reliability they require.  The cost savings are in man-hours for M & R, functionality, speed, and upgradability.  Not meeting the above wastes man-hours and budget. No Remanufactured, No Refrubished equipment is acceptable.  New only. Added additional bid terms CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Buyers and Sellers understand that FedBid ranks all bids by price, regardless of the evaluation criteria used by the Buyer; however, pursuant to applicable acquisition regulations and/or departmental guidelines, Buyers may use criteria other than price to evaluate the offer. Please note that any such evaluation criteria must be articulated in the solicitation to the extent required by such regulations and/or guidelines.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Solicitation Number HSCG40-06-Q-41561. 
1. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION:  This is a justification for the procurement of various Paxman Parts, as a commercial item acquisition, utilizing other than full and open competition procedures.  The various Paxman Parts are for engine model numbers manufactured by Man B&W Ltd., and installed on Coast Guard vessels and application. Only Paxman engine parts manufactured by or under contract to Man B&W Ltd. are acceptable to use in the overhaul of the Paxman Valenta engins, Model 16RP200m. The Paxman engine parts are manufactured using proprietary engineering information and are constructed in such a manner that only authorized distributors can supply this requirement. There are NON-Paxman engine parts that are acceptable to use on the overhaul of aforementioned Paxman engines. These parts are ones that have previously been supplied by a vendor and successfully used for overhaul of the same Paxman Valenta engines. Viking INC is the only acceptable supplier, who is not an authorized distributor of MAN B&W Ltd. 2.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The Coast Guard currently has a requirement these various Paxman parts in accordance with current OPEM specifications utilizing genuine OEM Parts.  The ELC anticipates awarding a firm fixed price type contract “only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements”. 3. APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  Man B&W Ltd.,is the only known company possessing the original drawings, specifications, engineering  control procedures and proprietary methods to ensure the latest design configuration, manufacturing and quality control required to produce parts to current engineering specifications and requirements. 4. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL SOURCES: Documentation available is not sufficient to provide for a competitive solicitation.  Paxman is not willing to sell the rights to its drawings and manufacturing data. Man B&W Ltd., the OEM of the parts, has proprietary rights to the  engineering drawings and specifications used to manufacture the parts.  Further, the scope of manufacturing special tools, and equipment required to manufacture the various parts are unknown.  5.  FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  The Contracting Officer anticipates that the cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable and consistent with previous purchase of same items and the Independent Government Estimate (IGE). FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  There are no known appropriate substitute parts for Paxman engine parts and only one known authorized supplier Man B&W LTD.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS AMENDED TO EXTEND THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE FROM 16 JANUARY 2006 TO 18 JANUARY 2006.

TITLE:  A Study on the Role of Well-Designed Transportation Projects Enhancing Communities*

ACTION:  As prescribed by SAFETEA-LU, Section 1925 entitled “Community Enhancement Study,” this is a notice of availability of funding for transportation research under a program to encourage relationships among transportation, community, and system preservation plans and practices and identify private sector-based initiatives to improve such relationships.  The FHWA anticipants awarding one cost reimbursement contract of up to 16 months in duration and $2 million to a national organization representing architects who have expertise in the design of a wide range of transportation and infrastructure projects, which include the design of buildings, public facilities, and surrounding communities to conduct the study.*

SUMMARY:  The FHWA will fund transportation research to conduct a study on the role of well-designed transportation projects enhancing communities in:
1.	Promoting economic development;
2.	Protecting public health, safety and the environment; and
3.	Enhancing the architectural design and planning of communities; and the positive economic, cultural, aesthetic, scenic, architectural, and environmental benefits of such projects for communities.*  

The study shall address the following:
1.	The degree to which well-designed transportation projects have positive economic, cultural, aesthetic, scenic, architectural, and environmental benefits for communities.
2.	The degree to which such projects protect and contribute to improvements in public health and safety.
3.	The degree to which such projects use inclusive public participation processes to achieve quicker, more certain, and better results.
4.	The degree to which positive results are achieved by linking transportation, design, and the implementation of community visions for the future.
5.	Facilitating the use of successful models or best practices in transportation investment or development to accomplish each of the following:
a.	Enhancement of community identity.
b.	Protection of public health and safety.
c.	Provision of a variety of choices in housing, shopping, transportation, employment, and recreation.
d.	Preservation and enhancement of existing infrastructure.
e.	Creation of a greater sense of community through public involvement.*

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Responses submitted for this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) must adhere to the format and content instructions set forth below. These instructions have been specifically tailored to the process and the evaluation criteria to be applied during proposal evaluation. Failure to submit any of the information requested by this BAA may be cause for unfavorable consideration. Any inconsistencies between the various sections of an Offeror’s response must be fully explained. A significant inconsistency, if unexplained, may raise a fundamental question of the Offeror’s understanding of the work required, and ability to perform the contract.*

The Offeror’s response should demonstrate their understanding of this procurement and capability for performance in a concise, logical manner and should not contain superfluous material, which is not directly related to this procurement.*

The Government will process late submissions of proposals in accordance with FAR 52.215-1. If a proposal is received late and is not eligible for consideration, then the Government will reject that proposal without evaluation.*

BUDGET/COST PROPOSAL

The total value of the award will not exceed $2,000,000 as follows: $1,600,000 basic requirement + $400,000 option.*

The budget for the basic requirement is $1,600,000.  All Offerors shall propose to complete the required deliverables as specified below within this budget.*  

FHWA acknowledges that requests for special studies could arise during the course of this effort.  Therefore, an optional financial set aside is available to support such analysis.  Each Offeror shall propose an unburdened plug number of $400,000 as a line item in the cost proposal entitled “Special Studies.” The Special Studies option may be exercised at the Government’s discretion and negotiated with the contractor during the course of this effort.*

NOTE: Cost sharing is encouraged.  Proposals may exceed the basic requirement budget ceiling and total budget ceiling if the additional resources are proposed as cost share.  Any cost share shall be included in detail in the Cost proposal.* 

DELIVERABLES

At a minimum, the Offeror shall provide the following deliverables.  The Offeror is not limited to these deliverables, and may elect to propose additional deliverables as part of their proposal.* 

The Contractor shall provide quarterly status reports to the Government providing an increasingly detailed outline of the Community Enhancement Study, including research undertaken and proposed for each 3-month period of the task.  The Government will meet with the Contractor at 4-month intervals to discuss progress on the study and to assess the need for “Special Studies.”  These meetings may occur via telephone, videoconference, or in person.  The Contractor will provide at the end of the contract a final report detailing the findings from the Community Enhancement Study.*

 The Contractor shall provide all report deliverables in camera-ready hard copy and an electronic copy in Microsoft Office 2000 or equivalent on a CD-ROM(s). In addition, electronic files containing the word processing, graphic, and table data may be required as deliverables. The Contractor shall establish electronic file transfer capabilities such that correspondence and deliverables can be communicated electronically to the FHWA Program Office.*

All products submitted under this announcement become the property of FHWA and may be disseminated or used for government purposes subsequent to the completion of the work.  The developer of the material also may have continued incidental use of the products for the purpose of additional research or marketing but may not sell or offer the products without prior approval of FHWA.*

REPORTING

The Contractor shall submit a brief monthly report until the work is completed.  The report should describe in brief (e.g. in outline format) work completed the prior month, work anticipated in the upcoming month, approximate percent of work completed and approximate amount of resources expended.*    

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS

Each proposals shall include:

1.	The full name, address, point of contact, a telephone number, fax number and an electronic mail address for the organization.
2.	A detailed description of proposed work describing
a.	Need or problem statement (1 page)
b.	Technical approach (30 pages) 
c.	Past performance relevant to current proposal with points of contact (up to two pages and may include references to readily accessible documents)
3.	The period of performance (time line) for the work and submission of deliverables (up to one page);
4.	Tailored biographies of key staff including relevant expertise (1 page for each key researcher and 1 page (inclusive) for all other staff);
5.	Description of facilities and equipment needed to support the proposal (2 pages); and
6.	A cost proposal indicating staffing levels, hours, hard costs for the total project and amount of funding expected from FHWA (Not To Exceed $2,000,000 in Federal funding).*

DATES:  Please be aware that the security procedures in the Nassif Building prohibit individuals from delivering material directly to offices in the building. Individuals visiting the building must report to the southwest guard station at the Nassif Building. All materials left there will be examined and x-rayed before being delivered to Room 4410 through the normal internal mail delivery procedures. As this can take up to several working days, offerors must make allowances to assure that proposals arrive in Room 4410 by 4:00 p.m. on January 16, 2006. Proposals received after the due date and time will be considered late in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.*

If so requested, the guard will call the Acquisition Office (x66714) to have someone come down and accept the material once it has been examined. Offers must be received and date/time stamped in Room 4410 by the prescribed date and time to be considered timely, not just delivered to the guard station, the Nassif mailroom or loading dock. While we will do our best to accommodate such requests, FHWA is not responsible if someone is not immediately available to pick up your proposal.*

Further, please be advised that all of our mail (items handled by the US Postal Service) is sent out of town for scanning and irradiation prior to delivery to this building. This process can take several days, so even if you mailed us something from across the street, it may be a week before it actually arrives here. FedEx and United Parcel Service do have direct access to the building and offices. Please keep these factors in mind as you determine the best means to deliver your proposal so as to ensure delivery in room 4410 by no later than 4:00 PM (local time).*

Submittals must be printed hard copies consisting of one original and four copies along with one electronic copy on CD-ROM.*

CONTRACT TYPE:  FHWA anticipates awarding one cost reimbursement type contract.*

ADDRESSES:  Proposals must be delivered to Christian Hellie in the FHWA Office of Acquisition Management, 400 7th Street, S.W., Room 4410, Washington, DC 20590 (Mail Stop HAAM-30E).  Please not that current security procedures may result in delays of USPS mail delivery.* 

For further information about the Community Enhancement Study, please contact Kenneth Petty in the FHWA Office of Planning at 202-366-6654 or kenneth.petty@fhwa.dot.gov.*   

EVALUATION GENERAL

The Government will award a contract to an acceptable Offeror who is the best overall value, basing its source selection decisions on three factors – Technical, Cost/Price, and Business Factors  among the competing offerors.
	
1.	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s best interest.

2.	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

3.	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

4.	A cost realism analysis may be performed, and the source selection authority may consider cost realism in evaluating performance or schedule risk.*

<DESC>Questions and Answers Regarding this solicitation:
July 11, 2006

Question 1:  Is the requirement for exactly 25 layers of Aramid fiber an absolute requirement and offerors with different composition to be eliminated?
 
Answer 1. We are using these body armor panels for a research study on artificial
aging. We want to be very certain that there is enough material available for
the body armor panels to maintain their performance during this artificial
aging research study. Thus, we are extremely confident that we need 25 layers
of material in these vests. There are several (NOT JUST ONE) certified models
that meet this requirement.


Question 2:  It is not normal business for a manufacturer to obtain the yarn used to manufacture the ballistic material.  Is this the reason for the delivery time of six months so that the manufacturer can obtain the yarn?

Answer 2. If an offeror is able to provide a quicker delivery time, then they may do so.
