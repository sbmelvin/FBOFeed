<DESC>There is NO INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR.  This is a FULL-AND-OPEN-COMPETITIVE procurement.  In a Request for Proposals (RFP) which will be published soon in FedBizOpps at Internet address http://www.eps.gov, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) will be seeking proposals for one 20-month cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for a project to be entitled “Clarus Weather System Design”.  Clarus is the Nationwide Surface Transportation Weather Observing and Forecasting System.  Clarus is NOT an acronym, but instead is simply the Latin word for “clear”.  Clarus will demonstrate a road weather observation data-sharing network and a suite of forecasting tools enabled through establishment of the network.  The contractor selected in THIS procurement will be required to apply the Clarus Concept of Operations and Use Case Diagrams-----those items are currently being created by a SEPARATE contractor OUTSIDE this procurement, and the FHWA hopes to make at least a preliminary version of those items available to offerors under THIS procurement, as an attachment to THIS procurement’s RFP----to establish Clarus system requirements, to develop design documents for an open extensible system, and to conduct a Proof-of-Concept Demonstration.  The contractor selected in THIS procurement will be required to create an open systems design for exchanging and managing surface transportation weather observations and forecasting, to demonstrate a working proof of concept showing coordinated performance among the system’s components, and to prepare enhancements to the system design that overcome limitations of the observed proof of concept demonstration.  The contractor selected in THIS procurement will be required to utilize a systems engineering approach-----consisting of High Level System Requirements (such as user interaction with the system for road weather information needs); Detailed System Requirements (such as communications protocols, programming interfaces, format translators, and data storage capabilities); an Architecture Analysis and a Design Gap Analysis to develop a High Level Design by examining alternative architectures and exposing limitations in Environmental Sensor Stations deployment; Detailed Design, including System Design Documents that define the hardware configuration and develop system software specifications; and Implementation, integration and testing in a Proof of Concept Demonstration; Subsystem Verification; System Verification----to develop full system design documentation that complies with the Concept of Operations and Use Cases.  The system will be evaluated to determine how it supports basic observation sharing that will ultimately fulfill road weather information needs.  Following the demonstration, the contractor shall use lessons learned to correct and enhance the system design and produce final system design documents.  An INDEPENDENT system verification and evaluation MAY occur under a procurement SEPARATE from THIS one.   The FHWA estimates that this procurement’s project will require:  472 staffing hours for a Program Manager; 1,240 staffing hours for a Principal Investigator; 2,440 aggregate hours for Senior/Key Task Professionals; 4,160 aggregate hours for Other Senior Professional/Technical Staff; 3,060 aggregate hours for Mid-Level Professional/Technical Staff; 2,060 aggregate hours for Junior Level Staff; 1,040 hours for Researchers/Technical Writers; 268 hours for Computer Support; and 528 aggregate hours for General Support Staff.   The minimum requirements for the staff members’ education and experience are as follows:  The Program Manager shall possess a technical degree and at least 15 years of experience in the research and application of ITS technologies, and shall possess at least five years of experience in managing a group of engineers in this field; but that five years of managerial experience COULD be contained WITHIN the 15 years of research experience.  The Principal Investigator shall possess at least 10 years of experience in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), road weather management, meteorology or transportation operations and should have a bachelors degree related to one of the following disciplines: civil engineering; systems engineering; meteorology; computer science; meteorology; or, management information systems.  Senior/Key Task Professionals shall possess five or more years of experience in ITS, road weather management, meteorology or transportation operations and shall have a technical degree preferably related to one of the following disciplines: civil engineering; systems engineering; meteorology; computer science; meteorology; or, management information systems.  Other Senior Professional/Technical Staff shall possess five or more years of experience in technical areas related to road weather management and should have a technical degree preferably related to one of the following disciplines: civil engineering; systems engineering; meteorology; computer science; meteorology; or, management information systems.  Mid-Level Professional/Technical Staff shall possess two or more years of experience in technical areas related to road weather management and should have a technical degree preferably related to one of the following disciplines: civil engineering; systems engineering; meteorology; computer science; meteorology; or, management information systems.

Because the ENTIRE RFP will be posted in FedBizOpps at the Internet address given above, the FHWA does NOT plan to issue any HARD copies of the RFP to any prospective offeror.  Therefore, prospective offerors are instructed NOT to send letters or faxes or e-mails requesting a copy of the RFP.  TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, AND FAXED REQUESTS FOR THE RFP WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Instead, all prospective offerors are to obtain the RFP from FedBizOpps.  Any subsequent AMENDMENTS to the RFP will LIKEWISE be published in FedBizOpps at the Internet address given above, and the FHWA does NOT plan to mail out HARD copies of any Amendments.  Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of each prospective offeror to closely and frequently monitor FedBizOpps for any AMENDMENTS to the RFP.  Monitoring FedBizOpps for any amendments to the RFP will be absolutely essential for all prospective offerors, since amendments usually contain crucial information.  It is currently estimated that the RFP will be posted to FedBizOpps on November 19, 2004.  The “DUE” date shown above is merely an ESTIMATE of the date on which proposals will be due.  The ACTUAL due date for the FHWA’s receipt of proposals will be stated in the RFP.  To repeat:  THIS RFP WILL BE FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIVE, AND THERE IS NO INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, is soliciting for research and development of counter-improvised explosive devices (IED) system.  The requirement for the system includes delivery of one complete change detection system with three-dimensional volumetric capability of detecting potential improvised explosive devices; demonstration and validation of the technical capability; demonstration and validation of the operational capability; technical and engineering support for delivery and test; and logistics and maintenance support.  Award will be made on a best value basis with technical and past performance, when combined, being considerably more important than cost or price.  The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price level of efforts contract as a result of this request for proposal.  The period of performance will be through 30 September 2006.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  SPECIFIC TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.  Build and deliver one complete integrated change detection system with properly finished and tested mechanical interfaces, mountings, and power and communications links within 120 days after notice of contract award.  The system must be capable of detecting potential IEDs and must consist of: an unmanned aerial vehicle capable of autonomous flight operations with immediate manual override; an integrated stabilized platform capable of securely mounting the change detection system; three-dimensional volumetric change detection payload with 14.4 mega pixel digital camera; fixed video camera; digital media storage with at least four gigabites; global positioning system unit; photography computer with fire wire capable of interfacing with change interface with change detection system digital camera; and consolidated Ground Control and Processing Station.  Demonstrate and Validate the Change Detection Technical Capability.  Test must be conducted at or during test venue as coordinated between MCWL and the Marine Expeditionary Forces.  The test plan will be developed by MCWL.  Demonstrate and Test Critical Operational Issue #1:  The change detection system must produce actionable intelligence in an operationally meaningful timeframe, to include the ability to: provide information suitable for an operational command to identify the most appropriate IED counter-measure mix for a given IED threat; make go-no-go decisions with respect to route selection and/or tactical deployment of human and material assets; make informed decisions with respect to deployment of Explosive Ordnance Detachment (EOD) personnel and assets; determine the nature, volume, and geo-location of IED threats along a specified route or in a specified area in an accurate and timely manner; and accurately (e.g. within 10 meters) geo-locate potential IEDs with a low probability of false alarm.  Demonstrate and Test Critical Operational Issue #2:  The system must demonstrate a false alarm rate low enough to be operationally acceptable.  The false alarm rate must be below that which could impact mission accomplishment (e.g., mission delay or cancellation, false assignment of low-density, high-demand assets (e.g., EOD teams)).  Demonstrate and Test Critical Operational Issue #3: With regard to training, the change detection system must be easy to operate, maintain, and repair by standard Marine operational resources in theater. Provide the necessary program management and system integration for a comprehensive United States Marine Corps evaluation of the change detection system at the agreed-to test venue.  Provide the necessary direct onsite technical and operational support for the agreed-to test venue.  This effort includes moving all the physical assets to the test venue, establishing a System Operating and Support Base, and executing the test plan as developed by MCWL.  Provide the necessary logistics and maintenance support for the IED system. Provide a detailed technical analysis and report upon completion of the test event.  The report shall include ground truth data collected during the evaluation, as well as, an assessment of system performance and operational reliability.  A System Operator’s Manual shall be prepared, as well as, any required Technical Manuals.  Offers submitted on a basis other than F.O.B. Destination may be considered non-responsive.  No bidders list will be maintained by this office.  Based upon market research, the Government is using the policies and procedures contained in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The following options are optional tasks, which may be exercised within the period of performance.  OPTION 1:  The contractor shall integrate a Digital Data Link (DDL) into the system to further reduce the “time-to-actionable-information” interval. The DDL shall include a Short Stack Video Transmitter in the aircraft and a ground-based data processing capability that should be able to handle up to 45 mbps.  The proposed DDL should be entirely integrated with the UAV airframe, and should provide the capability to transmit the captured and meta-tagged images directly from the UAV out to a range of 50 kilometers.  
OPTION 2.  The contractor shall build and deliver a second complete change detection system to form a 3-D Volumetric Change Detection Unit (a ground station with two (2) UAVs) for deployment in support of OIF operational forces.  The contractor shall provide six months of “in country System Operations and Support” during which time Marines will be trained on the change detection payload.  This team will provide support seven (7) days per week for 10 to 12 hours per day.  Inspection and acceptance will be at destination.

<DESC>On May 20, 2004 a sources sought synopsis (Reference # LCG-FCSR) was posted soliciting information for potential sources for Flight Critical Systems Research (FCSR). As stated in the sources sought synopsis, the Government was considering whether to procure the required FCSR through the solicitation and award of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) issued against GSA schedule contracts.  As a result of a detailed market research analysis and the information provided in the capability statements, the required FCSR will not be procured using GSA schedule contracts.   NASA Langley Research Center plans to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for FCSR on or about November 9, 2004. The objective of these task order contracts is to conduct basic and applied research, technology development, systems analyses, and systems integration in avionics systems critical to flight management.	This requirement is a follow-on to contracts: NAS1-00105 with ARINC Incorporated, NAS1-00106 with The Boeing Company, NAS1-00107 with Honeywell Technology Center, and NAS1-00108 with Rannoch Corporation.   The primary work areas are: I) Flight Dynamics, Guidance, and Control: This area of work includes but is not limited to, attached and separated-flow aerodynamics; static and dynamic stability; control effector characteristics; dynamic modeling methods; flight-control-law effects; flying and handling qualities; agility and maneuverability; out-of-control flight characteristics; guidance and control theory; control system concepts; controls allocation/reconfiguration; and control law design. II) Crew Systems and Aviation Operations: This area of work includes but is not limited to, integrated flight deck systems; aircraft self-separation and distributed air traffic management; atmospheric hazard awareness and avoidance; situation awareness assessment; synthetic vision; and human-centered design. III) Reliable Avionics Systems:  This area of work includes but is not limited to, mathematical proof of safety properties for software and hardware; fault tolerance; fault modeling and emulation; real-time upset detection and recovery; vehicle health management; commercial-off-the-shelf technology in safety-critical systems; complexity modeling and management; and integrated modular avionics. IV) Flight Critical Systems Analysis and Integration:  This area of work includes but is not limited to, performance of systems engineering in support of novel flight critical systems analysis and development from research concept through simulation and test to flight experiment.	 Multiple-award, cost-plus-fixed fee contracts are contemplated for this effort with a period of performance of sixty (60) months. The projected contract start date is on or about June 2004.  The DRFP will be issued pursuant to NASA FAR Supplement 1815.201. Questions/comments are invited and strongly encouraged from potential offerors on all aspects of the DRFP, including the requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, and evaluation approach. The Government is not requesting proposals in response to this DRFP, does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the DRFP, and does not intend to pay for any information received regarding this solicitation. Questions/comments shall be submitted in writing to the Contract Specialist, Krista Y. Jensen, by e-mail at Krista.Y.Jensen@nasa.gov .  Telephone questions will not be accepted.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 1,500 employees, respectively. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the internet at FedBizOpps (URL- http://www.fedbizopps.gov) and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service Web Sites (URL- http://prod.nais.nasa.gov).

Some of the very minimal requirements for this space include 1) location within the city limits of Homer Alaska; 2) Comply with the ADA (if 2 story must have elevator, access ramps, electronic door opening system, etc.); 3) paved parking lot; 4) and wired for CCE.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This announcement is edited to change the date and provide the location of the below mentioned workshop.  The date is November 5, 2004, 9:00 am to 12 noon.  The location is Arizona State University, Computing Commons Room 120. Attention: General Contractors, Mechanical Subcontractors, Plumbing Subcontractors, Electrical Subcontractors, Elevator Subcontractors, Pre-Cast Panel Fabricator/Erectors, Cab-Glass Glazing Subcontractors and Manufacturers. The FAA has a requirement for construction of an Airport Traffic Control Tower (ACTC) at the Phoenix Deer Valley Municipal Airport (DVT) Phoenix, AZ.  The project involves construction of an ATCT measuring 144' to the top of cab with structural precast panels on a mat foundation.   The scope of work also includes an attached 5,000 square foot base building, emergency generator building, entrance road, utilities, parking lot, and security systems. This project will be awarded using a best-value procurement process called the Performance Information Procurement System (PIPS).  Under this process, award will be made to that Offeror whose offer within the Governments budget of $7.8 million is determined to provide the greatest overall value to the FAA.  Best value will be based on performance, to include past performance of the prime (general) contractor and critical subcontractors (listed above), current performance capability, and price.  An educational workshop will be held to discuss the PIPS process and project requirements.  This workshop is mandatory for the prime (general) contractor.  All other vendors and individuals (site superintendents and project managers) are highly encouraged to attend to understand the project and how the award will be made.  The workshop will be held from 9:00 am  12:00 noon, November 5, 2004 at the Arizona State University, Computing Commons Room 120.  Interested vendors should RSVP via email to Contracting Officer Gerald Boyer at gerald.boyer@faa.gov no later than October 28, 2004.   Please provide the name(s) of the attendees, phone number(s), email addresses, and your area of expertise. Please CC John Savicky at john.savicky@asu.edu  (A map is attached or will be provided to vendors that RSVP.) Please note: This is neither a request for offers nor for capability statements.  However, the FAA reserves the right to no longer consider firms that fail to respond, to this announcement, respond incompletely or provide any information found to be verifiably false.  Details of the remaining phase(s) of this process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this public announcement.

<DESC>This amendment is posted to clear up any confusion for the due date of technical proposals.  The due date is November 24, 2004.

******************************************************************
******************************************************************

The General Services Administration (GSA) is in the process of requesting Proposals (RFP) for renovations to the Federal Building / Post Office  located at 657 Second Avenue North, Fargo, North Dakota.  GSA is soliciting contractors to participate in the “Best Value Source Selection” process for this project.  This process has been set aside for procurement under the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Step One requires the offeror and major subcontractors (Electrical only) to submit a technical proposal, without pricing.  Each Offeror must be a general contractor, and each offeror must submit between two (2) and four (4) major subcontractors. Following evaluation of the Technical Proposals, the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) shall make a Competitive Range determination that will include all offerors considered to have a reasonable probability of being selected for award.  All  offerors will be allowed to continue in the Source Selection process, however, those that fall outside of the competitive range will be notified that the SSEB has determined that they do not have a reasonable probability of award.  Step Two of this procedure will require the submission of priced proposals and management plans.  Following a final evaluation of the Price and management proposals, the SSEB shall determine which offeror to award the contract to based upon its Best Value analysis.

<DESC>The Naval Air Orlando Training Systems Division (NAVAIR Orlando TSD) contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research and development (R&D) in the areas of training and simulation technology. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is intended to cover, in general, all R&D areas of interest to the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) and its customers in the areas of (1) Human Performance Representation, (2) Knowledge Integration, (3) Command, Control, Computer, Communication, Information (C4I) to Simulation, (4) Verification, Validation, & Accreditation (VV&A), (5) Natural Environment Representation, (6) Composable Mission Space Environments, and (7) Collaborative Environments for Engineering and Simulation Education.  Specific scientific points of contact for each research area are identified on Page 1 of the BAA, as well as a detailed process that allows for an early determination of the potential for interest based on technical merit, applicability to the DMSO Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Program, and projected funding.  This process is designed to limit offeror and Government expenditure of effort to prepare and review formal proposals for research that may have little chance of being supported and consists of a technical dialog (telephone call to scientific point of contact and informal white paper submission), followed by formal proposal submission and contract award.  Those interested in performing research in the covered areas should download the BAA and initiate a technical dialog with the appropriate scientific point of contact.  Only questions regarding the BAA process itself should be addressed to the point of contact listed below.  This notice satisfies the requirement for annual synopsis.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing, as well as the deletion of the requirement to send a cover page to the Small Business office, and deletion of the Ombudsman program.  No other changes have been made.

Technical POC:  Mr. Daniel R. Kupiak, Program Manager, (315) 330-3206, email:  Daniel.Kupiak@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, (315) 330-1955, email:  Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal, including inquiries regarding white papers should be addressed to the technical POC.

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is soliciting white papers under this announcement for various scientific studies and experiments to increase the Air Force Research Laboratory's knowledge and understanding of correlation and fusion techniques and algorithms required in support of Air Force operations.  Solutions using new and innovative approaches are sought.  The scope of this effort covers a broad range of requirements in the area of SIGINT correlation and fusion.  Major areas of interest include, but are not limited to, (1) collection, (2) analysis, (3) processing, and (4) dissemination of SIGINT related information.  Emphasis is placed on the insertion of technology into existing and planned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems. 
Deliverables will be technical reports and, when appropriate, demonstrations and associated data. 

Principal funding for proposals selected from this announcement will begin in FY00 with awards not normally exceeding $500,000 in value and eighteen (18) months in duration.
 
Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  Total funding for the BAA is $4.75M.
 
Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the TOP SECRET SCI level, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to those proposed efforts must be already cleared for access to TOP SECRET SCI information.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Joetta A. Bernhard, (315) 330-2308, for information if they contemplate responding. 

DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME.  THIS PUBLICATION ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. 
Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a two (2) to ten (10) page white paper on their proposed research topic to:  Air Force Research Laboratory/IFEE, ATTN: Mr. Daniel Kupiak, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441. White papers must reference BAA 00-03-IFKPA.  White papers will be accepted until 30 Sep 2005, however, it is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY00-30 Apr 2000, FY01-30 Jan 2001, FY02-30 Jan 2002, FY03-30 Jan 2003, FY04-30 Jan 2004, FY05 – 30 Jan 2005.  Multiple white papers addressing different areas of applicability may be submitted by each offeror and are encouraged.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Offeror; Section B:  Task Objective; and Section C:  Technical Summary. Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in the letter requesting a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Proposals submitted as the result of a favorable white paper will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  Evaluation of white papers and proposals will be performed using the following criteria:  (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal.  (2) The potential contributions of the effort to the Air Force Research Laboratory mission and the extent to which the proposed effort will contribute to balancing the overall research and development program of the Air Force Research Laboratory. (3) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.  (4) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The offeror's record of past and present performance.  (6) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any. No further evaluation criteria will be used in source selection.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated simultaneously. 
An informational briefing is not planned, but may be scheduled should conditions warrant. A copy of the Rome “BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry,” Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.
 
All responsible organizations may submit a white paper, which shall be considered.  Respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission, reference BAA 00-03-IFKPA.  All responses to this announcement must reference the above topic as well as BAA-00-03-IFKPA.
 
This announcement is open and effective until 30 Sep 2005. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>The VA Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System, Omaha Division is seeking sources for agency nurses.  Please read the following description very closely before responding to this notice.  This facility is intending on an upcoming solicitation for short-term agency nurses who will be needed on an emergency, short notice basis.  FSS contractors are invited to be a part of the solicitation but need to clearly understand the requirements.  This facility will need a company who can provide locally based nurses.  We will need to have a pool of available nurses who can be oriented (a three day process) and then be available on short notice.  This is not a requirement for traveling nurses as these appointments will not be long term.  We anticipate that appointments will be anywhere from one day to two weeks.  There is the possibility that a long term (six weeks or more) appointment may come up but it will be rare.  Currently, we are only considering utilizing this type of contract for the Omaha facility; however, we reserve the right to add our Lincoln and Grand Island facilities to any subsequent solicitation and contract.  The majority of the nursing needs will be for registered nurses; however, we may consider licensed practical nurses within the scope.  Areas of experience for the agency nurses will be conscious sedation administration and recovery, general medical surgical, monitoring skills, IV insertion, assessment capabilities, care planning, patient education, emotional support, ICU and urgent care.  This is a fairly comprehensive listing but could include other categories as well.  Even though we need 24 hour availability, the majority of shifts that will need to be covered will be the midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift.  This may constitute the only nation-wide announcement for this requirement so if you feel you can provide the services, be sure to respond to this announcement.  Please no telephone calls.  If you wish to be considered or if you have specific questions, e-mail the Contracting Officer at Brenda.birks@med.va.gov.  All responses and/or questions need to be received by the Contracting Officer no later than November 1, 2004.  At this time, this will be an unrestricted solicitation unless it is determined through responses and market research that there will be sufficient small business and/or small disadvantaged and other socioeconomic categories to warrant a set aside action.  Please be sure to note your business size and any special socioeconomic classifications.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 621399 with an average annual of $6 million.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is publicizing this sources sought announcement to amendment the information contained in sources sought synopsis N00178-04-Q-3048 posted on 13 August 2004.   N00178-05-Q-3006 hereby changes the information contained in N00178-04-Q-3048 to a competitive small business set-aside acquisition to determine prospective small businesses capable of providing Scientific and Engineering Support for Directed Energy Technology Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) for NSWCDD Code B20.  This new synopsis hereby extends the date for submission of capabilities statements by qualified small businesses to 5 November 2004.  Capable small businesses shall also identify if they are currently a team member under any multiple award contract vehicles such as a GSA Multiple Award Schedule contract, NAVSEA’s Seaport E contract, etc.  All other requirements of the synopsis remain the same and are hereby restated in their!  entirety. This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. Overview:  NSWCDD directed energy support encompassed within this sources sought is focused on high power microwave (HPM) / radio frequency (RF) and high energy laser (HEL) technologies with the objective to improve the Navy’s near- and far-term airborne, surface, subsurface, and space warfare capabilities through the utilization of this transformational technology.  With advances in reliant technologies and Navy interest in the all-electric ship concept, directed energy technologies are beginning to be considered for an increased role to satisfy Navy mission requirements in both blue water and littoral environments.  The application of advanced directed energy technologies will be tested with hardware based upon foundational research and development characterized by “hands-on” prototyping made possible through theoretical calculations, laboratory experimentation, and computerized modeling and simulation.  The technologies will then be assessed with static and dynamic labora! tory and field tests to demonstrate potential feasibility.  To be considered a potential source, the contractor must be able to provide scientific and engineering support for the design, test, and performance evaluation of HPM / RF systems and subsystems, and HEL lethality design, test, and performance evaluation to support blue water and littoral missions for the Navy.  Labor Requirements:  The current labor support required as part of this sources sought can be categorized as 80% HPM / RF-related and 20% HEL related.  This percentage is expected to remain equivalent for the near-term.  Specific contractor personnel support should include, but not be limited to, the following full-time equivalent areas of expertise (manning levels to be used for initial planning purposes only are annotated in parenthesis): senior HPM / RF / pulse power engineer (1); senior HPM / RF / pulse power electronics technician (2); mid-level HPM / RF / pulse power engineer (2); mid-level HPM / RF / ! pulse power electronics technician (3); mid-level senior electromagnetic modeling and simulation physicist / engineer (2); senior electro-optics / laser engineer (1); mid-level electro-optics / laser technician (2); mid-level mechanical engineer (1); mid-level network and computing engineer (1).  Task Requirements:  The contractor tasks shall provide support to NSWCDD technicians, scientists, and engineers in various task areas to include threat analysis, system analysis, RF / HEL systems design and development, RF / HEL system test and evaluation, automated data collection and analysis, physics-based computer modeling and simulation design and development, and setup / maintenance / operations of both indoor laboratories and outdoors experimental test ranges.  Support of unique expertise associated with the development and analyses of directed energy technologies may be needed.  Evaluation of candidate system and subsystem performance analyses will be conducted in both stati! c and dynamic laboratory and field site environments, as well as the development of system models and computerized simulation capabilities in order to evaluate performance in a cost-effective manner.  The evaluation of various system performance techniques will require the use and development of specialized commercial and custom devices, technologies, and methods, to include applications in the areas of RF / HEL sources, calibration equipment and facilities, high-bandwidth electromagnetically tolerant diagnostic instrumentation, software and hardware based data acquisition systems, and high-speed image acquisition and processing systems.  The contractor shall calibrate, operate, and maintain these complex devices, systems, and facilities and perform detailed data reduction and analysis.  The contractor shall assist with the selection, development, and integration of measurement platforms.  Field exercises could be conducted in a variety of international locations, but the ma! jority will be located within the continental United States.  Virtually all of the support contractor personnel work tasks are expected to be conducted on-site at NSWCDD, Dahlgren VA.  The contractor shall provide technical and engineering support for the evaluation of emerging technologies for potential systems and subsystems.  The contractor shall participate in test planning and utilize computerized simulation capabilities to predict testing outcomes.  The contractor shall provide technical and engineering support in the analysis of test results, support technical evaluation of the test results, and report on the test results.  The contractor shall provide technical and system engineering support for analyses and investigations, and provide input to NSWCDD to support the preparation and updating of program documentation.  This includes analysis of proposed system or equipment changes; recommended changes to documentation; and analysis of technical, operational, cost, risk! , and schedule factors in support of program reporting requirements.  The contractor will need to acquire some hardware (with the Government providing the remainder), as well as design and fabricate components and subsystems required to conduct the assigned tasks.  The hardware required for supporting test and evaluation tasks shall include data acquisition and storage systems as well as electrical or mechanical fixtures to interface system or test equipment to land, ship, or airborne platforms.  For planning purposes, the approximate percentage of tasks assigned with this contract is two-thirds services-related and one-third hardware-related.  The contractor shall be required to operate in specialized classified environments that require security clearances up to the Top Secret level.  Scope of Effort:  The contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (term and completion) pricing arrangement with a period of p! erformance of five (5) years comprised of approximately fifteen (15) man-years total.  Work is planned to begin in March 2005.  Criteria:  Responses should address, as a minimum, the following criteria: (1) demonstrated experience and qualifications of personnel relevant to the proposed tasks, identifying key and supporting personnel, and their previous research and accomplishments on similar or closely related projects; (2) demonstrated ability to obtain security clearances at the time of contract award for all personnel expected to provide contractor support in accordance with the above requirements; (3) demonstrated current corporate in-house experience in providing directed energy RDT&E support services to include system and subsystem design and integration; data collection, reduction, and analyses; modeling and simulation; and laboratory and field test planning, operations, and evaluations; and (4) expected percentage of effort, if any, to be subcontracted and whether 8! (a), small, or large businesses will be used.  Experience must include demonstrated capabilities to understand issues associated with Navy system development and evaluation, and the roles / relationships of military laboratory and field activities supporting such activities.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT.  The U. S. Navy is seeking sources to provide nineteen Interim Message Processing Systems (IMPS) for E-6B aircraft and associated facilities.  The hardware and software of the current message processing system, the Mission Computer Set (MCS), are expected to become unsupportable by 2007.  A Fully Deployed, Mission Ready IMPS is required by 2007 to bridge the gap between MCS obsolescence and final fielding of the Mission Avionics Processing System (MAPS) as part of the Block I Modification (Block I) program in 2014.  IMPS hardware and software must be compatible with both the  E-6 Automatic Data Processing / Demand Assigned Multiple Access / Weight Savings (ADWS) modification, and to the greatest extent possible, Block I.  Offerors should be prepared to enter into an Associate Contractor Agreement with the Block I contractor, Rockwell Collins Inc.  The IMPS must perform the message processing functions of the MCS using digital communications processing applications to provide the proper release authority for efficient reception and transmission of nuclear command and control and Emergency Action Messages (EAMs).  The applications provided will include existing functions such as the transmission, reception, processing, storage, and retrieval of communications messages using a graphical user interface.  This upgrade consists of replacing current hardware and software components in the MCS processor unit, with Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and new mission applications software.  This must be accomplished while maintaining all current MCS operations and functionality.  The successful offeror will design and develop a high level-system architecture and perform the engineering research and analysis necessary to proceed with nonrecurring engineering development.  The developed system architecture will address current supportability and stability issues including obsolescence of current hardware and software.  The IMPS design must, to the maximum extent possible, be common with MAPS software and hardware architecture to minimize rework during the Block I installation.  Offerors must be prepared to discuss their unique qualifications to provide an IMPS that can process EAMs and nuclear command and control messages; interface with existing and planned E-6 communications equipment including the Nuclear Planning and Execution System; and process Top Secret (TS) and TS Single Integrated Operations Plan information.  Offerors should be prepared to discuss the provision of one Systems Integration Lab kit and its installation in FY05, sixteen aircraft and two trainer kits in FY06 and installation of aircraft and trainer kits in FY07.  IMPS installations in E-6B aircraft must be completed no later than September 2007.  A draft IMPS specification and STATEMENT OF WORK WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.  Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement are currently available.    Interested parties are requested to submit a brief statement of interest/capabilities no later than 4:00PM Eastern Standard Time on 4 November 2004.  Electronic responses are preferred.  This Sources Sought announcement is not a contract, or a requested proposal, or a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind.  The Navy will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for any data offered for examination; therefore, the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.  Submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government.  Submissions will not be returned.  Please send two copies of your Statement of Capability in accordance with Note 25 to: Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command (Attn: Jeffrey L. O’Neil, AIR-2.3.1.4.2), 47123 Buse Road, Unit #IPT, Building 2272 (Suite 155), Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547.   Numbered note 25 applies.

<DESC>Request for Information for a Head Quarters Pacific Air Force (PACAF) Strategic Planning Function associated with managing Hazardous Materials Pharmacies (HAZMART) Facilities at multiple PACAF sites.

1.  SUBJECT
Request for Information (RFI) and sources sought inquiry for HAZMART service providers and information regarding the commerciality of HAZMART services.  Responses are due for this RFI by 4:00 PM HST on November 16, 2004.  See section 6.0 for further information.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  

2.  DESCRIPTION
HQ/PACAF is seeking information from industry that will assist in a strategic planning initiative associated with Hazardous Materials Pharmacies in various PACAF sites.  (Examples only:  Hickam AFB (HI), Eielson AFB (AK), Kadena AFB (Okinawa), Elmendorf AFB (AK), Osan AFB (ROK), Kunsan AFB (ROK), Andersen AFB, (Guam), Misawa AFB (Japan), and Yokota (Japan).)  Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: 
Identification of sources and interested parties
Feasibility alternatives assessments
Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing HAZMART
Approximate cost information (i.e. order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives
Commerciality questionnaire associated with HAZMART facilities and services

3.  REQUIREMENTS
The purpose of the HAZMART is to provide Air Force installations with a standard way of managing hazardous material (HAZMAT) procurement, use and compliance with ESOH requirements.  Although the primary focus is on HAZMAT procurement and issue in support of the AF mission, the broader objective is to protect the environment, safety and health of potentially affected workers and surrounding communities, and to reduce the dependence on HAZMAT through use of more environmentally friendly substitutes.  The HAZMART provides for process-based authorizing, procuring, issuing, tracking, and disposing of HAZMAT.  It is a repository for data required to meet reporting requirements, assess Air Force processes for pollution prevention opportunities, and measure success in minimizing HAZMAT use.  Services support the tracking of Hazardous Material  (HAZMAT) from cradle to grave.  Provide all personnel, supervision and services necessary to operate the HAZMART.  Alternatively or additionally, the service provider shall provide personnel, supervision and services necessary to accomplish administration of the AF-approved tracking system (or PACAF authorized equivalent), management of the AF-approved tracking system database, Compliance Assistance Visits and adhering to all Air Force policies and goals on HAZMAT minimization.  The service provider shall strictly adhere to federal, state, local, hazardous material and waste regulations, and overseas final governing standards, related to operating the HAZMART.  

Monitor and track all Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) on applicable installations identified to the HAZMART from the time it enters the installation, until moved off the installation for disposal, reuse, or consumed by use, (barcode is the preferred method).  This includes material used by units deployed to the installation with hazardous materials, government-wide purchase card (GPC) procurements, contractor purchased/used, contracting purchased transactions, and supply system transactions.

Participate in the base Hazardous Material Management Process (HMMP) team, Environmental Protection Committee (EPC), and appropriate subcommittees (i.e. Pollution Prevention Subcommittee).  These committees meet at least quarterly at applicable installations.  

Enter pertinent HAZMAT data and track HAZMAT located on the installation in an AF-approved tracking system or designated PACAF-approved equivalent.  Serve as the first stop for submittal of AF authorization request information by reviewing submitted information and supporting materials for accuracy and completeness.  For any requested material that is not currently loaded in the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system immediately forward material information to the HMMP team for a determination whether it meets the HAZMAT definition in paragraph

Focal point for hazardous material issues. Maintain and track items in a Free-Issue storage area in the HAZMART facility for all HAZMAT turned in from base customers.  Promote the free-issue operation through the use of web sites and other mediums such as the base bulletin/base newspaper.

Maximize HAZMAT usage by reusing/redistributing excess HAZMAT on base to other Air Force bases, or through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) Reutilization, Transfer, Donation, and Sales (RTDS) program.  Before ordering or purchasing HAZMAT, determine if it is possible to obtain the HAZMAT from the installation free-issue, reuse, and redistribution program, as the preferred HAZMAT source.

Work with customers and suppliers to ensure they purchase HAZMATs in practical quantities to minimize waste, handling, and storage costs.

Perform quality control functions to properly identify items as possible HAZMATs to prevent inadvertent procurement or issue transactions for unauthorized materials.  Immediately notify the HMMP team of any suspected or potential HAZMAT that has not been properly coded as a HAZMAT.
Assist users in identifying HAZMAT stock numbers and/or part numbers, and finding appropriate MSDS.

Use the AF Class I ODS Requisition SAO Approval process described in AF Instructions/Policy.

This market survey questionnaire represents the intention of the U.S. Army to solicit information from potential suppliers regarding their capability to meet our technical, cost, and schedule requirements for the Armys upcoming RESET effort.  This RESET e ffort involves returning all battle worn or damaged M1000s to a like new condition (zero miles/zero hours) IAW the M1000 performance description, without adversely impacting the existing logistics/support system.  In addition, a maximum timeframe of 120 p roduction (calendar) days is essential to maintain readiness for worldwide deployment requirements.  Intent: It is the intent of TACOM, on behalf of the Army, to award a four year Requirements contract.  The M1000 semi trailers are fielded to Active, U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard units.   Description of System: The M1000 Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET) semi trailer carries a variety of payloads, ranging from ISO containers to armored vehicles and other heavy equipment   a 70 ton nominal load, including the Abrams Main Battle Tank (M1 Seri es),  It is equipped with five axle lines with two half-width axles per line.  Each axle can oscillate laterally to accommodate crowned roads and rough terrain.  Axles 2, 3, 4 and 5 automatically steer to proper Ackerman geometry based on normal tractor mo vement. The deck is adjustable (+/- 10 inches from normal operating height) to accommodate loading/unloading. The gooseneck, suspension, and steering systems operate off a hydraulic system. Diesel or JP-8 auxiliary power is provided to operate the goosenec k, steering, and deck controls independent of a prime mover.  The brakes are operated through a two-line straight air supply from the Prime Mover with five tanks on the vehicle.  Each axle is equipped with spring actuated park/emergency features.  A pivoti ng, hydraulically supported gooseneck equalizes the 5th wheel load and provides flexibility over rough terrain.

However, the requirement is being revised and the installation portion will be removed and included in the Installation Support Services contract.  Any information relative to this new solicitation will be posted on the SPAWAR E-Commerce site as it becomes available.  To view more information about solicitation N65236-05-R-0502, visit the SPAWAR E-Commerce website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/.

<SUBJECT>58 -- BAA SURVEILLANCE and RECONNAISSANCE
<DESC>This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in 
FAR 6.102(d) (2).  The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is soliciting proposals to increase operator Surveillance and Reconaissance (SR) agility and options through the rapid insertion of maturing and emerging SR technologies specifically for: Sensors; Tagging, Tracking, and Locating; and supporting technologies such as SR Communications and Power management.  The SR technology will be characterized, vetted in experiments and demonstrations, and in user exercises to globally track targets.  Residual “operational prototypes” are then made available for future employment consideration.  

The objective of this BAA is to provide USSOCOM with innovative, unique, creative SR solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches and improvement in the following SR areas: 

Sensors Guidance: Sensing technologies should consider all observable phenomenology (seismic, magnetic, infrared, acoustic, electromagnetic, hyper-spectral, multi-spectral, nuclear, biometric, biological, chemical, etc.).  Ideally, sensing devices will be delivered and set-up using remote/hands-off techniques.  Sensors must be rugged, capable of withstanding environmental changes, and should be small in size and have wide bandwidth capability.  Sensor objectives include combining seismic, magnetic, acoustic, and microwave sensing technologies into single units where feasible; reducing sensor size; improving power management/endurance; improving reliability/reduce false alarm rates; improving capability to remotely emplace the sensors.
Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Technology Guidance: The Government requires an immediate capability to precisely tag, track, and locate global targets.  The TTL systems must provide the users with enhanced situational awareness information from various emplaced devices.  Since the requirements for TTL are too broad to be satisfied by a single device, the broader requirement is for a toolbox of TTL devices integrated into an interoperable architecture that would provide ready options for use in short/no notice crisis.  TTL technologies include but are not limited to integrated global positioning devices, improved optical tags, improved waveform tags, biometrics, and signature exploitation for automatic identification/detection.  

General SR technology areas of interest are:  1) Miniaturization of sensing technology, communication modules and antennae, 2) Ruggedized and hardened hardware, both in fabrication and packaging, able to withstand a variety of environmental conditions and temperatures, 3) Lightweight (to enable an individual to easily carry in a pocket or small pack) 4) Self-powered (long-life battery, solar, friction dynamo, other) 5) Disguisable 6) Remote autonomous applications, 7) Stand off applications.

It is not the intent of this solicitation to establish new facilities, rather, to identify institutions that have demonstrated integration and development capabilities and have the necessary facilities to meet the objectives described in this BAA.  This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selection.  All are invited to submit a project proposal not exceeding 20 pages of text that describes the following:  1) The development and integration objective,  2) The development approach, 3) Related work by the investigator or proposer, 4) Anticipated contributions to USSOCOM programs, 5) An estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to a three year effort, 6) Proposed payment milestones and program schedule, and 7) A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) appended with any supporting information, such as reprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal submission.  Additionally, all offers must identify any rights and restrictions that exist on their technical data, and all offerors are advised that restrictions on technology transfers outside of the U.S. will be imposed on all media created IAW this BAA.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to USSOCOM SOALK-KBA 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621 (Attn.: H92222-05-R-0003) on or before 12:00 NOON, on 6 December 04.  

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM.  Small businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.   

 
This program will be run at the U.S. SECRET/NOFORN level of classification. A program Security Classification Guide (SCG) for this program is available on request and required for guidance on proposal preparation. Performers must have required U.S. personnel clearances, cleared facilities, storage, and processing capabilities to bid on this solicitation as defined in the program SCG. In the event of discrepancies between information presented from this synopsis or the SCG, the SCG takes precedence.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  1) Practical application and operational technical merits of the proposed SR technology,  2) Demonstration of current emerging development model device,     3) Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support and conduct the integration, demonstrations, training, and deployment of systems and supporting architectures 4) Relevance of the proposed SR technology application to USSOCOM program priorities, 5) Realism of the proposed costs.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists. 

The Government may award single or multiple contracts in accordance with technical priority and funding availability.  The government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents. Proposals may be selected and/or award decisions made without discussions or negotiations.     

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE: There will be no other requests for proposals or other formal solicitations regarding this announcement.

The project will consist of research on the musical tastes and preferences of Arab adults, ages 17-28.  Research will be conducted by playing musical excerpts provided by IBB to a sample drawn from the target audience and recording reactions to a brief questionnaire designed to elicit listeners' likes and dislikes, as well as the intensity of their preferences.  Contractor shall have demonstrated ability and experience in performing market research and public opinion polling services as outlined herein.   DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED FIELDWORK:  The primary object of this research is to test respondents' familiarity with and reactions to individual musical selections, as identified by brief, easily recognizable excerpts, usually lasting between 5 and 10 seconds in length.  Details of required fieldwork are as follows: [1] Contractor shall provide supervision of fieldwork; [2] Music research shall be conducted on a weekly basis in all cities with the exception of Baghdad which shall be conducted on a bi-weekly basis.   [3] Sample universe shall be the adult populations between the ages of 17 and 28 (inclusive) of the following cities: Amman, Cairo, Abu Dhabi, and Casablanca and Baghdad.  [4] Contractor shall recruit a fresh sample of 50 respondents each week in each city, except in Baghdad, where a fresh sample of respondents shall be recruited every two weeks.  [5] In the initial stage of sampling, recognized probability techniques shall be used to select households for screening to ascertain the presence of eligible household members.   In the event that a selected household does not contain any members eligible for this study, or eligible members within the household refuse to participate, successive additional households shall be identified, again based on recognized probability techniques until a substitute respondent has been successfully recruited.  In no case shall more than one respondent be drawn from the same household.  [6] Screening criteria and quotas:  Contractor shall insure that all respondents fall in the SES categories A, B, C1, or C2, as these categories are commonly defined by market research agencies in the countries concerned.  Proportions of each week's sample in each group should roughly follow the underlying population distribution.  In no case should the total proportion of A/B individuals in a weekly sample exceed 20%.  Each weekly sample should be approximately half male and half female.  In addition, approximately half of each weekly sample should be between the ages of 17-22 (inclusive) with the other half between the ages of 23 and 28 (inclusive).  All respondents should listen to music at least one hour per week and should listen to music on the radio at least 30 minutes per week.  Contractor shall screen all potential respondents for musical preferences.   Contractor shall eliminate from the sample all respondents who dislike contemporary Western music. [7] Interviews will take place in the respondent's home, with interviewer playing musical hooks on a CD or tape player provided by the Contractor. [8] Interviewers will employ a questionnaire requiring respondent to indicate familiarity with each song played, as well as favorability rating for each song with which respondent is familiar.  Questionnaire will contain up to five minutes of additional questions, to be determined by IBB in consultation with contractor. [9] Approximately 100 songs shall be tested each week, using hooks to be provided by IBB (with the exception of Baghdad, where the number of songs shall be tested approximately every two weeks).  It is expected that weekly compilation of hooks will be provided electronically to contractor as MP3 files. CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES:  The Contractor shall be responsible for the project design, drafting, translation, formatting, adaptation and printing of the survey instruments; developing the sample plan and screening procedures; training interviewers, supervising fieldwork; cleaning and encoding survey responses; entering and processing the data; preparing tabulations in data books; submitting data in electronic form, and communicating all necessary information and results to IBB in a timely manner.   DELIVERABLES:  Results from Amman, Alexandria, Abu Dhabi and Casablanca shall be delivered to IBB each week in electronic form.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

See Numbered Note 1.  52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of past performance, price and technical acceptability.

The factors, in order of importance are (1) technical acceptability, (2) past performance and (3) price.  With regard to Past Performance: The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.

The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

Options-the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  The clause at FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services applies.  The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days.  The clause at FAR 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract applies.  The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided, that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires.  The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.  If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.  The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 57 months.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ .

II.  24-HOUR TELEPHONE SERVICES

A) The Contractor shall make available a counselor to covered employees via a toll-free telephone line, which is to be manned on a 24-hour per day basis.  The Contractor shall provide within the technical proposal a brief description of the proposed telephone service, including number of rings prior to response time, from inception of the call to initiation of counseling, handling of emergencies, etc.  During the initial call received by the Counselor the determination must be made that the caller’s need is an emergency/non-emergency.  All calls shall be handled in a manner appropriate to the potential urgency and possible consequences of the situation.

B) Telephone counseling staff shall possess the necessary skills to respond in a manner suitable to the caller’s immediate needs.

III.  ROLE OF THE COUNSELORS

A) On-site (Location Code 425698101, Philadelphia PA), in-person referral and counseling is required four (4) hours each Wednesday between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. at the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP-P), 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111.  More than 4 hours may be offered at the contractor’s discretion.  Off-site, in-person counseling within the local commuting areas listed in Section I above shall also be made available.  In addition, the contractor must ensure that off-site counseling is easily accessible via public transportation (when available).  Off-site, in-person counseling shall also be made available between 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday at a site within the normal commuting area at no additional cost to the Government.  NAVICP-P will provide the office space, a telephone and furniture for the Contractor’s use at NAVICP-P.  

B) Counseling activities will be short-term in nature and will focus on diagnostic evaluation and motivational counseling.  The Contractor shall make available at a minimum, six (6) diagnostic/counseling sessions per employee, for each presenting problem during the term of the contract.  Six sessions shall be provided if requested by the employee.  Thereafter, when necessary, the employee shall be referred to community resources in such a manner as will permit appropriate and skillful management of the problem presented.  Sessions in excess of six may be offered to the employee at the discretion of the Contractor.  An employee may be referred without receiving six sessions if the problem is, in the professional opinion of the counselor, better referred to a more appropriate resource, or due to the severity of the problem or the urgency of the situation, immediate referral is appropriate.  The Contractor will be responsible for investigating and initiating appropriate insurance arrangements for the employee.

C) The Contractor shall be responsible for establishing and coordinating the program in close collaboration and the technical guidance of the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR), Human Resources Office, Mechanicsburg, PA - Philadelphia Site (HRO-P), Code HR23.04, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5098.  The Contractor will plan, develop, use, maintain and manage a record system in accordance with applicable laws and regulations allowing verification of usage, documented by number of employees counseled per day, by activity and category or reason for contact (e.g., Alcoholism, Drug Abuse, Emotional Disorders, Elder Care, Stress, etc.).

D) The Contractor must be available to provide consultation to managers/Employee Relations Specialists to assist them in dealing with problem employees and to provide direct counseling to employees with problems.  Close working relationships with community resources, which offer treatment and rehabilitation assistance to individuals with problems, are to be developed and maintained.  Counselors must possess the necessary skills to enable them to determine the nature of the problem affecting the employee through interviewing and counseling of the employee.  Counselors must familiarize themselves with coverage provided by the various Federal Employee Health Benefits Programs, so as to be able to appropriately advise Federal clients relative to type of treatment covered.
  
E) Specifically, Employee Assistance Program Counselors will:

1.  Interview managers/Employee Relations Specialists 
as requested by the COR and provide them with guidance in confronting employees with job performance or behavioral problems.  Advise managers/Employee Relations Specialists regarding client confidentiality requirements.

2.  Interview the employee and obtain the appropriate 
information including medical history, if necessary, to determine the nature of the employee’s problem.

3.  Provide initial and short-term rehabilitation 
counseling or advise the employee of appropriate available community treatment resources, help make arrangements for utilizing them, and encourage the employee to participate in a rehabilitation program.

4.  Maintain ongoing contact with the community 
treatment program to which the employee is referred, and ongoing contact with the employee regarding progress in treatment and adjustment on the job.  Where applicable, and allowed by the confidentiality requirements, the counselor shall also appraise the referring manager/Employee Relations Specialist of the employee’s progress in treatment, assisting where possible in job adjustment.

5.  Where appropriate, and allowed by the 
confidentiality requirements, coordinate the employee’s rehabilitation program and progress with others who have legitimate need to be involved. 

IV.  PROCEDURAL STEPS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT

A) Management-Initiated Referral

1.  A manager/Employee Relations Specialist who is 
aware of deterioration in an employee’s job performance, or altered behavior patterns, may refer employee to the Contractor.

2.  When the employee agrees to participate in an 
appropriate rehabilitation program, the counselor, after professional assessment of the case, shall discuss appropriate rehabilitation timetable and goals with the employee.  A release of information consent will be required for management-initiated referral.

3.  Throughout the treatment program, within the 
bounds of the confidentiality requirements, the counselor will be available to the manager/Employee Relations Specialist and to treatment resources to discuss rehabilitative efforts and for maintenance of a well-coordinated rehabilitation program.

B) Employee-Initiated Referrals

1.  When an employee initiates contact with the
Employee Assistance Program staff, he/she will receive counseling and be referred to community resources or facilities for such assistance as is appropriate or necessary.

2.  In such employee-initiated situations, the 
confidentiality requirements will be strictly observed and the employee will not ordinarily be asked to sign a consent statement for release of information to his/her supervisor.

PCO Logistics is required to track equipment, materials and goods coming into Iraq under the Re-building Iraq effort. This tracking and inherent accountability process will assist in assuring that all equipment materials and goods are able to cross the borders and move to final destination with minimal delay and at reduced risk.   However, in order to accomplish this mission, maximum cooperation is necessary.  Prompt notification and compliance with our information requirements will assist in providing advance notice to the point of entry of all inbound shipments.  This process affords coordination in the movement of all convoys which will enable improved monitoring and de-conflicted convoy schedule.  Prompt notification also improves security coordination through the operations center.
To get started follow the following steps:   

Step One: 
Upon contract award the contractor is required to provide the necessary logistical information needed by PCO Logistics. This information can be provided and updated as necessary by going to the PCO website (http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net) and logging in by selecting “Contractor/Vendor Log In” under the Logistic heading.  Initial log in will require the user to request a user name and password. Once the username and password is provided the user can identify and grant access to the other members or subcontractors.    Should there be any problems with this process contact the Logistics Movement Coordination Center (LMCC) Watch Officer directly at the following e-mail address:  pcolmcc@halliburton.com and the necessary assistance will be provided.  If the interim process is still in place the contractor will find four (4) forms listed and available under the logistics heading (Logistics Information Requirements Form, Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form, Cargo Plaques and Logistical Support Request).  Those forms should be individually completed and, with the exception of the cargo plaque, sent electronically to the above mentioned e-mail address for the LMCC.  The first form submitted will be the Logistics Information Requirements Form. The Logistics Information Requirements Form should be completed upon award of contract and updated as necessary.  All updates and changes to this form should be sent to the same e-mail address as the original form.  Additional contact information is available on the website mentioned above. Always reference the contract number.  

Step Two:
CPA 1-47  CUSTOMS LEVY EXEMPTION AND SHIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AND CONTRACTING OFFICE (PCO) 

Effective 15 April 2004 Tariff Regulations pursuant to CPA Orders #54, as amended by Order #70 (Orders #54 and #70 are posted on the website), require commercial importations into Iraq to pay a 5% levy except for food, books, medicine, medical equipment, clothes and oil.   Additional exemptions include NGO’s, International Organizations, Reconstruction Projects under PCO, and single exempt donations.   Items shipped under this contract are exempt from this “Levy” provided a completed Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form is attached and included with each invoice and packing slip.  
 
The contractor is required to fill out the Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form and attach the duty free form to each shipment of goods under this contract that crosses the border into Iraq in order to qualify for the exemption.  The contractor must submit one copy of the completed duty free form and a copy of the first page of the primary contract, for customs verification, to the contracting officer and the PCO Logistics Office at pcocustoms@halliburton.com) 72 hours prior to the planned arrival date at the Iraq point of entry.


Step Three:
The items being acquired are for Iraqi Reconstruction and as per the “Packing and Marking Instructions” of this contract, and shall be Packaged and Marked accordingly.  Additionally, a Cargo Plaque is available from the website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net under the logistics tab located at the top of the page.  There is a memorandum posted that explains how to complete the plaques.  There are three plaques, one is for shipments arriving into Baghdad International Airport, one is for shipments arriving into the Port of Umm Qasr, and the third one is for all other shipments.  The use of these plaques will ensure they are properly identified as PCO shipments and will reduce risk of loss or pilferage.  Each shipment must have a cargo plaque affixed to all sides of each container, pallet, or package.
 
The following is information will be provided upon award to assist with the completion of the cargo plaque

Step Four:

The LSR can be found at the above mentioned web site under the logistics tab.


It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide all the requested information mentioned above as well as using the identified cargo plaques in sufficient time to allow for required delivery.  Failure to comply with these instructions may result in a delay of the goods and materials being shipped from arriving at their final destination.
