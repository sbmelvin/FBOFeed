<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT SYNOPSIS: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source contract with the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  NAPA will  undertake a management review and assessment of the CDC's cash awards programs including but not limited to the review of CDC's policy, procedures, administration, and oversight for cash awards for all federal employees, its senior federal employee compensation program, i.e. senior executive service (SES), distinguished scientists under Title 42, senior biomedical research service (SBRS), and Title 38 medical professionals, and the use of retention bonuses and allowances for all CDC federal employees. NAPA is an independent, non-profit, non partisan independent advisor to the nation on public administration issues, and is chartered by the U.S. Congress.  NAPA is being called upon by the Federal Government in accordance with their congressional charter, Public Law 98-257 to conduct this assessment. NAPA consists of an elected membership with extensive, high-level experience in public administration, both from a management and an academic standpoint. NAPA has a broad base of contacts throughout the public sector, which can be drawn upon quickly in researching problems and issues. As an organization with extensive resources, including scholars and practitioners of public administration, NAPA offers a uniquely objective, independent assessment. This independence enables the Government to receive an unbiased evaluation and authoritative advice in the areas of management and policy issues. The diverse backgrounds of the committee members provide an unequal wealth of expertise that provides NAPA the ability to improve the effectiveness of government. NAPA's charter includes a broad range of responsibilities which formed its mission. One segment of NAPA's mission is to investigate experiment and report upon any subject of government whenever called upon by Congress or the Federal Government.  The Federal Government looks to the Academy for independent, unbiased, and technically complex assessments of critical issues and problems.  Based on the unique qualifications of NAPA and the critical need for unbiased assistance on issues of immediate and major concern, it is in the Government's best interests to enter into a sole source agreement to obtain the services of NAPA. The actual expense of investigations, examinations, and reports provided by NAPA will be paid by the Federal Government from appropriations available for such purpose. Contract is to be in two phases for a period of 12 months from the date of award. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-5 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's needs. All responsible sources that feel they should be considered qualified to provide the foregoing services may submit a response to this notice within 15 days of synopsis publication.  Information furnished shall include enough detailed documentation to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

Noncompetitive award is being made because this source has a contract with the National Science Center for similar services in the area and will already be mobilized and performing in the area.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to the Contracting Officer by e-mail (rdonez@usgs.gov) no later than the response date shown in the announcement.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION

Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology, SOL BAA 07-13, Abstracts Not Requested, Proposals Due: 19 March 2007; Technical POC: Dr. Todd C. Hughes, Program Manager, DARPA/IXO; Phone (581) 218-4984.

BACKGROUND: The recognition of targets in urban environments poses unique operational challenges for the warfighter.  Historically, target recognition has focused on conventional military objects, with particular emphasis on military vehicles such as tanks and armored personnel carriers.  In many cases, these threats exhibit unique signatures and are relatively geographically isolated from densely populated areas.  The same cannot be said of today's asymmetric threats, which are embedded in urban areas, thereby forcing U.S. Forces to engage enemy combatants in cities with large civilian populations.  Under these conditions, even the most common urban objects can have tactical significance: trash cans can contain improvised explosive devices, doors can conceal snipers, jersey barriers can block troop ingress, roof tops can become landing zones, and so on.  Today's urban missions, from event security to insurgent extraction,involve analyzing a multitude of urban objects in the area of regard.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION: The objective of the Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT) program is to develop a 3D urban object recognition and exploitation system that enables advanced mission planning and situation analysis capabilities for the warfighter operating in urban environments.  DARPA/IXO is soliciting proposals for URGENT Phase 1, which focuses on the development of novel and innovative approaches to urban object recognition from electro-optical (EO) and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor data.  Phase 1 of the URGENT program will develop techniques for the rapid exploitation of EO and LIDAR sensor data at the city scale (100s KM2) to recognize urban objects down to the soldier scale (<1M3).  URGENT will apply image processing technology to this geospatially registered 2D/3D data collected from airborne and terrestrial sources, yielding precise annotations for the objects in an urban area.  Traditional pattern recognition systems, biologically inspired computer vision technology, and machine learning algorithms are among the approaches of interest to the URGENT program.  It is envisioned that the URGENT system will identify specific urban objects of interest in a city containing thousands of objects, with variability in 3D viewpoint, inter- and intra-class appearance, articulation, scale, and occlusion.  Of special interest are innovative approaches that support far greater variability than the existing detailed model methods typically used for object recognition.  DARPA is also interested in innovative approaches to object recognition that require neither the creation of highly detailed object models nor the extensive maintenance of model libraries.  The URGENT Phase 1 goal is to achieve a 100x increase in image analyst productivity with equal or better accuracy compared to the unassisted human image analyst.  Meeting this challenge requires that the URGENT system to be not only highly accurate but also computationally efficient. 

TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES:  DARPA intends to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding BAA 07-13.  Technical, contractual, or administrative questions must be sent to baa07-13@darpa.mil.  Answers to all questions generally relevant to the technical, contractual, and administrative aspects of the solicitation will be posted at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations.asp#0713 under Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for public access.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the upcoming release of the final Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) System Development and Demonstration (SDD) solicitation.  This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition and provides for the procurement of the SDD Phase for the BAMS UAS Program, with options for the first Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of the BAMS UAS, Technical Data Packages (TDPs)/Data Rights for Title 10 U.S.C., Chapter 146, Section 2464, Core Logistics Capability; life cycle support within a competitively selected Performance Based Logistics (PBL) support environment centered on organic or Contractor Logistics Support (CLS); and for the development of a Common Mission Control System for UASs.  The RFP also includes options addressing Australian Unique Objectives, including the procurement of an Australian BAMS UAS, TDPs/Data Rights in support of the Australian BAMS UAS for Depot Level Repair Logistics Capability; life cycle support within a competitively selected PBL support environment centered on organic or CLS; and for the development of a Common Mission Control System for UASs.  The anticipated contract type is Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF); however, the option line items for TDPs/Data Rights are Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 336411, Aircraft Manufacturing.  Contract award is anticipated in the first quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 08.

With respect to the United States Navy (USN) requirements, the BAMS UAS will provide a persistent maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) data collection and dissemination capability to the Fleet; serving as a force multiplier for the Joint Force and Fleet Commander, enhancing situational awareness of the battlespace, and shortening the sensor-to-shooter kill chain. The BAMS UAS will deliver capability enabling the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force (MPRF) Family of Systems (FoS) to meet the Navy's maritime ISR requirements. BAMS UAS full operational capability will provide for up to five simultaneous orbits worldwide.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the BAMS UAS is defined as one base unit with sufficient assets, technical data, training systems, and enough spares and support equipment to operationally support one persistent ISR orbit.  The desired IOC is FY14, however, the objective is to achieve IOC in FY13 or earlier.  At IOC, the BAMS UAS missions will include, but are not limited to, maritime surveillance, collection of enemy order of battle information, battle damage assessment, port surveillance, communication relay, and support of the following missions - maritime interdiction, surface warfare, battlespace management, and targeting for maritime and littoral strike missions.  The proposed system architecture will be driven by the requirements and constrained by the program schedule and affordability goals contained in the solicitation and in the BAMS UAS Performance Based System Specification (PBSS). 


The Australian BAMS UAS options provide for the expansion of the BAMS UAS SDD program to include the design, development and demonstration of a solution that meets Australia's objectives.  For the purposes of the Australian objectives, In Service Date (ISD) is defined as the year in which the first elements of the capability are planned to enter service, though not necessarily be ready for operational employment. The first elements of capability consist of an air vehicle, a fully populated payload, communication suite, mission planning, simulation and mission control system. ISD will be achieved in Calendar Year (CY) 13.  The Australian IOC for the BAMS UAS is defined as one base unit with sufficient assets, technical data, training systems, and enough spares and support equipment to operationally support three periods of 24 hour surveillance per week. IOC will be achieved in CY15.  
 
The contract period of performance for the SDD phase shall begin on the date of contract award and be completed by the date of IOC in accordance with the SDD Contract Top-Level Integrated Master Schedule (IMS).  The required delivery of the LRIP system(s) is within 24 months or the date specified in the SDD Contract Top-Level IMS whichever is earlier, after exercise of option.  For the Australian BAMS UAS option, the period of performance shall begin on the date of option exercise and be completed by the date of Australia's IOC in accordance with the SDD Contract Top-Level IMS.  All data shall be delivered in accordance with the applicable DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL).  

Upon formal release of the RFP, interested parties will be able to view/download the RFP (N00019-07-R-0001), exclusive of the Performance Based System Specification (PBSS),  posted on the NAVAIR web-site http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center San Diego, Seal Beach Division intends to procure a fixed price contract for the design, performance, delivery, installation, and testing of the Fault Tolerant Microwave Equipment.  The Southern California Offshore Range (SCORE) currently has 155 Mb/s microwave links between Naval Air Station (NAS) North Island (NI) to San Clemente Island (SCI).   Due to topography two legs are used.  The first leg is a 10 mile link from NASNI to Mt. Soledad.  At each end there is an Alcatel MDR-4308s hot standby radio connected to an Andrews UHX-8 antenna.  The second leg is a 72 mile link from Mt. Soledad to SCI.  At each end there is an Alcatel MDR-4308s high power, quad diversity unit connected to a pair of Andrews UHX-12 antennas.  High power/quad diversity is required because of the long distance and poor propagation characteristics of the over-the-water shot.  SCORE requires more bandwidth between NAS North Island and SCI in order to meet e!  xpanding fleet training requirements.  An additional capacity of 155Mb/s is required.  The existing bandwidth available is being exceeded and causing degradation of service.  The added OC3 link will allow SCORE to run the Virtual Large Area Networks (VLANS) on the new link and free up the existing link from overload.  As part of this effort the vendor shall be required to retune the existing Alcatel MDR-4308S Microwave radios to operate new frequencies.  This procurement is in support of  Naval Surface Warfare Center Corona Division, Corona, CA 92878.  This is an Unrestricted requirement.  The NAICS Code is 334220.  The size standard is 750 people.  The Government anticipates that a site survey may be conducted. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted by 21 Feb 2007 on both FEDBIZOPPS (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) and NECO (http://www.neco.navy.mil/).

NAWCADLKE intends to procure under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c ) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from Medical Data Science Pharma Services (MDS), one of the leaders in the field of clinical trials.  MDS has a dedicated full time clinical trial staff, which is designed to attend to all the needs of a clinical trial from inception to conclusion, including doctors, nurses, nurse assistants, medical technicians, psychological support, dietary experts, project managers and contract managers. Competition is impracticable for the following reasons: (a) MDS is to conduct the clinical trial portion of FDA protocol INSCOP-001-C, which was submitted to FDA in 2006; (b) Since the proposed clinical trails is for a drug undergoing the approval process for clinical use, but has not yet been approved for this purpose by the FDA, it is imperative that the trials be in accordance with FDA guidelines.  The clinical trial is an efficacy trial in prolonged-6 degree head down bed rest subjects, a condition which simulates microgravity environment, and appropriate measures must be taken to provide for the needs of the subjects.  The selected facility for the trials must meet the following requirements: (a) be approved for FDA clinical trials; (b) must be in good standing with the FDA; (c) must have a staff trained in FDA clinical trial procedures; (d) must have a favorable history with industry; and (e) must have extensive experience in dealing with the FDA on behalf of contractors.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for 200 extended wavelength, wideband, InGaAs, optical detectors operating in 2 microns region of spectrum.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Sensors Unlimited, as the only known source who can meet Agency requirements.  Sensors Unlimited is the only supplier that has successfully delivered the 2-micron detectors with the required bandwidth of wind lidar applications in the past. To ensure wind band operation, the detector effective capacitance has to be less than 1.5 pf (pico Farad) with 1.0 volts of bias voltage.  NASA existing experimental breadboard lidar systems and the laboratory setups use the Sensors Unlimted detectors, therefore the acquisition of the same detectors will provide identical spare detectors thus allowing uninterrupted operation of the experimental setups and breadboard lidars. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 14, 2007.

In 2005, Braskem produced 6.4 million tons of primary base, secondary and intermediate petrochemicals.

The Companhia de Saneamento de Minas Gerais (COPASA), the ?Grantee,? invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for COPASA Water Re-Use Project. 

COPASA, the State of Minas Gerais Water and Sanitation Company, has identified the development of water re-use facilities as an important part of its water resources management strategy.  To that end, the company has targeted the Arrudas Wastewater Treatment Plant (WTP) as the site of a water re-use project, which will involve adding tertiary treatment systems in order to produce an effluent that meets water quality requirements for urban residential, commercial and industrial water needs.  

The Arrudas WTP is the largest plant in the state and uses a conventional activated sludge system that will provide a high quality secondary wastewater as influent to the tertiary treatment plant.  Located in the state capital of Belo Horizonte, the Arrudas WTP site offers proximity to a large potential market of clients for the reclaimed wastewater.  There is also land available for the installation of the tertiary treatment units.

The proposed project is consistent with COPASA water conservation and environmental management policies and echoes COPASA?s interest in the preservation of fresh water resources.  If successfully implemented, the project will provide a potential avenue for more rational use of fresh water resources in the study area.  In addition, it will provide a beneficial precedent for other similar projects in the State of Minas Gerais.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Add 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (10 AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

Item: 0002
NSN: 2915013432931PRPR SENSOR,TEMPERATURE,
P/N: 1534M60P04, 
Description: Temperature is sensed by a helium-filled sensing coil acting upon sensing bellows attached to a metering valve.  A second bellows is reference bellows.  Pressurized helium gas in sensing coil reacts to temperature changes.  When temperature increases, gas pressure increases.   When temperature decreases, gas pressure decreases.  Control servo pressure (PC) is supplied through a fixed orifice in main engine control.  Pressure between fixed orifice and metering valve is P6 Pressure.  Pressure (P6) is regulated to that required to overcome force of helium acting on sensing bellows, plus force of preload springs, plus force of bypass pressure (PD) acting on reference bellows.  This interaction of forces regulats P6 at a constant value above PD at a constant value above PD at a given temperature.  An increases in temperature expands helium gas in sensing coil and sensing bellows.  As sensing bellows expands, opening at metering valve is decreased.  A smaller amount of P6 is than blec to PD, thus increasing P6 pressure.   A temperature decrease in helium-filled sensing coil causes gas to contract.  As gas contracts, metering valve opens farther, bleeding more P6 pressure to PD, and P6 pressure decreases.  The reference bellows allows for variations in PD and is used to maintain absolute pressure reference.  FUNCTION:  The sensor is a temperature sensor and transducer unit for main engine control.  It responds to changes in fan discharge temperature and regulates pressure as a function of discharge temperature.  DIMENSIONS:  'Sensor body/length 3.000inches, width 4.390 inches, height 2.400 inches.  Temperature coil dimensions:  length 7.188 inches, width 2.750 inches, height 2.750 inches, weight (dry) 2.82 lbs, signal pressures 24.1-182.4 PSI above main fuel pump boost pressure and proportional to temperature, filter screen size 70 microns (nominal), pressure line  connection0.562-18 UNF-3A thread, temperature range -65F to 480F.  MATERIAL:  consists of aluminum exterior surfaces anodized per MIL-L-8625 class I Type II.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS FOR TECHNICAL AND OUTREACH SUPPORT SERVICES FOR DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL CLIMATE INITIATIVES AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAMS. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Change Division (CCD) intends to issue a solicitation for support in evaluating and implementing programs domestically and internationally, associated with GHGs and ODS, including CO2, CH4, HCFCs, HFCs, methyl bromide, PFCs, SF6, NF3, CFCs, chlorobromo methane, halons, hydrocarbons, potential substitutes for ODSs, and environmental emissions such as N2O, O3, CO, NOX and particulate matter. Other programs that will be supported are voluntary programs which promote profitable opportunities for reducing emissions of methane and High Global Warming Potential (High-GWP) Gases. These programs are designed to overcome a wide range of informational, technical, and institutional barriers to reduce GHG emissions, while creating profitable activities for industry. In addition CCD conducts technical and economic analyses related to the role of methane and other non-CO2 GHGs in climate change, including development of emissions inventories and mitigation cost analyses. This requirement is a re-competition of EPA contracts 68-W-02-027, 68-W-02-028, and 68-W-02-029; BPAs GS-10F-0036K, GS-10F-0124J and GS-10F-0283K.  The EPA anticipates awarding multiple, fixed-rate, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts to support this requirement.  The period of performance will be a base year with four, one-year optional periods.  The total anticipated level of effort for all contracts is 243,000 hours over five years.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. This requirement will be partially set-aside for small business concerns.  The EPA may award one or more small business contracts under this set-aside in accordance with the entire statement of work.   Interested parties may review the draft statement of work, as well as minutes and the attendee list from the Industry Day conference held on August 29, 2006 at the following EPA website:  http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0615587/index.htm  Numbered Notes: 2 Questions pertaining to this notice may be directed to Heather Scanio, scanio.heather@epa.gov Contract Specialist.

Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller.  IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cisco equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Departments networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of States enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).   . As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.<BR><BR>

<SOLNBR>C-5AMP
<RESPDATE>021207
<ARCHDATE>02282007
<CONTACT>Vicki Diaz, 937-255-0748
<DESC>The 716 AESG, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH contemplates the award of sole source contract actions to add avionics capability, to  include Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) GPS  implementation, Enhanced Surveillance and Deficiency Report Correction for  the C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  Lockheed-Martin Corporation  was awarded the C-5 AMP Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development  contract under full and open, best value source selection in 1999.  The  contract included competitively priced production options for AMP kits,  spares, and installation for up to 124 aircraft.  Budget adjustments and  program delays forced the need to restructure the options for production  for up to 53 operational C-5 A/B/C aircraft.  A Source Sought Synopsis was  submitted for this restructure on 19 Oct and received no responses.  Real  world changes have driven the need for added avionics capability, to  include Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) GPS  implementation, Enhanced Surveillance and Deficiency Report Correction.  Lockheed-Martin Corp is the only source possessing the technical and  engineering expertise to manage this added avionics capability of C-5 AMP,  maintaining total schedule, configuration, and system performance  responsibility of the re-phased acquisition.  Sole source negotiation for  restructure of options for kits and spares for C-5 AMP production is  envisioned pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented  under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The USAF cannot provide sufficient drawings,  data, etc to facilitate award of kits and spares to another source.  Sole  source negotiation for managing additional avionics capability for C-5 AMP  is envisioned pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as  implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  TCTO 714 and Level 3 wire harness  installation drawings are available.  The 716 AESG, however, believes that  award of the management over this added avionics capability to another  source would result in substantial duplication of cost that the Government  would not recover through competition and would result in unacceptable  delays in fulfilling USAF requirements.  Lockheed-Martin, at the start of  the up to 53 installations covered by this action, will have completed 59  to 60 installations at Dover and Travis Air Force Bases.  The 716 AESG  does not plan to issue a formal Request for Proposal.  Interested sources,  however, are invited to submit capability statements for consideration.  Such statements shall be submitted no later than 12 February 2007 to 716  AESG/PK, Building 558, 2590 Loop Road West, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7142 to the attention of Ms. Vicki Diaz, Contracting Officer.

<CONTACT>Joann L Freeman, Contract Specialist, 210-977-4182 Sandra Phillips, 210-977-5487
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR CDRL SOFTWARE.  HQ CPSG/PK, Lackland AFB TX, is seeking sources for a software module to manage the DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) and data deliverables of multiple contracts within the Crypto Modernization (CM) Program.  Management of data includes scanning, data input, storage, modification, reproduction, automation, notification, tracking, reporting, and statuses of CDRLs, Data Item Descriptions (DID), and Logistics, Engineering, and Security data submittals.  More specific functions would include: An Integrated DID repository; Generation of CDRL 1423 Forms; Managing; Contract Line Item Numbers, Modifications and CDRL versions; Linking CDRL deliveries to contract milestones; Generating recurring CDRL delivery schedules; Forecasting CDRL receipts via calendar; Online CDRL submittal portals for vendors; Managing data separation security; Auto-route CDRL submittals for approval; Auto-alert reviewers via e-mail.  Twenty five (25) User Licenses of the Software, Initial User Training, Installation, and Operational Services are required.  Licensing will be flexible enough for multiple users from different elements of the CM Program to make use of.  For example: Users of two separate projects can use the system simultaneously and when CDRL requirements draw down at the end of their contracts, a third user can begin using the system.

<DESC>The government is seeking sources for the procurement, delivery and assembly of a total of 27 environmentally friendly steel aviation and armor targets for three separate installations.   MCAS Cherry Point is in need of ten targets that replicate BRDMs for installation on Bombing Target (BT) 11.  MCB Camp Butler requires a mix of vehicle replicas; three BRDMs, three BMPs and four T72 tanks for installation in the central training area.  MCB Hawaii requires two BRDMs, two BMPs and three T-72 tank replicas for installation in the Kaneohe Bay Range and Training Facility.  These targets, commonly known as Green Targets, are unique in the industry and were designed specifically to be helicopter transportable, environmentally friendly and extremely durable to withstand impacts from large caliber weapons.  These targets are made from sheet steel with interlocking slots that fit together to keep it erect and three-dimensional.  They have coatings to give the appearance of th!  e actual vehicle without having any material that is harmful to the environment.  The helicopter transportability reduces the need for explosive ordinance clearing of routes into the target area. The contractor shall furnish the necessary services, supplies, FOB destination delivery to the bases at MCAS Cherry Point NC, MCB Camp Butler, Okinawa JA and MCB Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay, HI.  Installation and assembly is required.   The anticipated delivery date is 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.

<CONTACT>John E. Lynch john.e.lynch2@usmc.mil Sandi Brubaker sandi.brubaker@usmc.mil
<DESC>The government is seeking sources to upgrade the breacher house at the Goettge Demolition Range at MCB Quantico VA.  This project would include replacement of an existing target structure known as the multi-use house.  Sole user of this range facility is Dynamic Entry School (DES).  DES is the lead formal school for the Marine Corps for the instruction of dynamic entry skill sets.  These skills include: 1) ballistic entry, 2) mechanical entry, 3) thermal entry and 4) explosive entry.  The existing training structure is a simple, wood framed faade that has survived far past its useful life expectancy.  The rigors of dynamic breaching have rendered it unsafe for continued training. This contract would remove the existing breacher house and replace it with a training system constructed of shock absorbing concrete (SACON).  This training device shall have interior measurements approximately 15 x 30 feet and have a single slope pitched roof.  It shall have a breachable door on each long wall at opposite ends of the structure.  It must have a breachable window on each of the short walls.  It will require two interior rooms approximately 8 x 10 feet centered on one of the long walls of the larger structure.  The two rooms will have a common wall with a door between.  Each small room must have a breachable entry door.  Separate from the breacher house but positioned nearby, there must be two SACON facades for the purpose of external breaching. These facades should be approximately 20 long and 8 high and must each have two windows (36 x 36 inch) and three standard (36 x 80 inch) doorways.  All doorways for the building and walls must be able to frame in a s!  tandard size door for breacher training.  The training site has several existing concrete pads that are suitable for placing the SACON panels.   The anticipated delivery date is 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.

<DESC>The government is seeking sources for the procurement and installation of a temporary Shock Absorbing Concrete (SACON) training system for the MOUT Assault Course (MAC) Grenadier M203 Practice Range at the MAC on MCB Quantico VA.  The existing structure was built of wood in the 1980s and has fallen into severe disrepair.  Removal of the existing range materials will be accomplished by the government prior to this contract taking effect. The contractor will fabricate and install two temporary SACON facades on an existing range.  The first of the facades will form the firing line for the M203 gunners operating in an urban setting.  It must be at least 12 feet long and 8 feet tall with two windows and a door to be used as firing positions.  The second faade must be located between 100 and 150 yards distant from the first.  It must be at least two stories in height (approximately 18 feet) and at least forty (40) feet wide.  It must have two windows and a door on the bottom level and at least three windows on the top level.  The windows should be about three feet square.  The door should be 36 x 80 inches.  The windows and doors serve as the targets through which the M203 grenadiers will shoot.   The two story faade must have short (8 feet) stub walls on each side to simulate three dimensions.  It must also have a stairwell and walkway on the down range side to facilitate emplacement and servicing targets.  Th!  is target structure will be used for training practice rounds only so will not be subjected to the explosive power of the M203 high explosive rounds. The site for these temporary training facilities will have a level ground condition, and the supplier will be required to provide a packed earth/dross pad where the training structure is to be erected.  All facades are to be considered non-inhabitable and temporary.  Walls must be detachable for removal and replacement if warn from bullet/explosive strikes. The anticipated delivery date is 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice only. The tracking number for this announcement is VA-797-07-RI-0037.  The purpose of this Sources Sought announcement is to identify potential firms that have the capability of providing an existing Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) or Government of the Shelf (GOTS) automated Federalized Warrant Management System. The requirements to ensure a user friendly system include, but are not limited to: Electronic transmission of the warrant request; Pull up various online forms; Track continuing education/training requirements; Electronic Approval; Repository of Warranted Personnel; Ability to store electronic files. There are a number of high level policy sources which require consideration in the warrant management process and include, but are not limited to: VAAR; FAR; DAUC; OFPP; DOE Website for Acquisitions; OPM Qualification Standard for Contract Specialist; Office of Acquisition &Materiel Management Information Letters; VA Handbooks & Directives; and ClingerCohen Act. FAR 1.603 provides requisites for granting contracting authority to select contracting officers. Section 414(4) of Title 41 U.S.C. requires agency heads to maintain a system for the selection, appointment, and termination of appointment of contracting officers. The FAR provides general guidance on establishing this program.  In selecting candidates for contracting authority, the FAR requires appointing officials to consider complexity and dollar value of the acquisition, the candidate's experience, training, education, business acumen, judgment, character, and knowledge of the applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The VAAR supplements the FAR by outlining the requirements and limitation for granting contracting authority within VA. Currently, the codified coverage is under revision. The current requirements for selection and appointment of contracting officers are pending completion through the formal rule-making process.  COCB staff uses the DAUC to determine training course equivalencies and college courses that are considered acquisition-related. The DAUC is also used to identify requisites for the DAWIAct Certification Program. The DAUC falls under policies but it is one of several documents, websites, and publications from which requirements are established. These publications establish objectives for everything from appointment to termination of a warrant.  The following requirements are classified as requirements for the four business processes of the automated Warrant Management System. The system requirements covering the general principles for a warrant management system process include, but are not limited to: (1) Providing an online form for requester to submit requests and supporting documents to HCA; (2) Allowing HCAs to grant basic level warrants within their realm of authority; (3) Limiting HCAs from exceeding authority; (4) Submitting supporting documentation and requests electronically to the Analyst from the HCA; (5) Accepting online receipt, analysis, and recommendation of the request and supporting documentation; (6) Routing electronic transmission of the supporting documentation to next reviewing official based on the business processes for review, concurrence, approval/denial, and feedback; (7) Providing NCM, CLO, network directors, and HCA partitions to access their respective activities; (8) Accessing various external system websites for online requirements and internal policies, handbooks and directives from within the system; (9) Tracking and monitoring all warrant activities to generate reports regarding numbers, effective dates, expiration dates, contracting authority, etc.; (10) Providing short-term and long-term archiving in accordance with VA Records Control System; (11) Providing electronic signature capability; (12) Providing a career record for each acquisition professional that has all of their certifications (Acquisition Career Record Brief); (13) Providing the ability to annotate remarks, comments or explanations regarding the warrants; (14) Tracking continuing education, training, requirements and skills currency required for warrant renewal; (15) Provide automatic notification to acquisition professionals regarding annual requirements; (16) Scanning historical data; (17) Providing standard interfaces with VA legacy systems such as CAMEO, eCMS, etc.; (18) Auto-generate tracking number by administration, VHA VISN or office, warrant type, fiscal year, and sequential number (5) Review/edit online or print and upload the attachments; (19) Archive current, active warrant level and provide history of previous inactive warrant levels (20) Secure final certification from further edits; (21) Limit the printing of Warrant certificates; and (22) Provide ability for a repository database on acquisition workforce to include basic warrants holders, ad hoc and standard reports, and graphical presentation for HR purposes and Gap analysis.

<SUBJECT>99 -- PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE PROCUREMENT LIST OF THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR SEVERELY DISABLED
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.

This notice concerns an action which may affect your company's continued business with the Federal Government and should not be disregarded.  It is in your best interest to respond to this letter.

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a service is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the following service to the P/L:

Vehicle Washing (Mobile) and Maintenance Management Services at various locations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for the General Services Administration, United States Postal Service, and United States Customs and Border Patrol.  The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, 651 Federal Drive, Suite 118-03, Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.  

Before adding a service to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal of this contract from commercial channels would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing vehicle washing and maintenance services in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to GSA and the extent to which the potentially these affected suppliers are dependent on the income.

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing vehicle washing (mobile) and maintenance services to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) the length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these services to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 4, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If the completed Contractor Data Form is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that you have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact on your firm should the listed service be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced service to the P/L, please contact Mr. Barry S. Lineback at (703) 603-2118 or Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<DESC>GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION

	Change in Fee Structure for FIPS 201 Product/Service Evaluations
AGENCY:  Office of Governmentwide Policy, General Services Administration.
ACTION:  Notice  
SUMMARY:  Under the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 201 Evaluation Program, the General Services Administration (GSA) publishes this notice of intent that it will no longer fund product/service evaluations as of April 3, 2007. Overall impact on the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program is minimal with respect to operations.  Product/service evaluations will continue to be performed and approved through the current fully operational laboratory and future qualified laboratories; however, fees for evaluations will be borne on a cost reimbursable basis by the Supplier.  Instruction on how to obtain product/service evaluations and an estimated fee structure will be posted at:   (http://fips201ep.cio.gov/index.php)

DATES:  The GSA FIPS 201 Evaluation Program currently provides funding for evaluation of products and services through its fully operational laboratory.  Suppliers whose applications for evaluation are received by the laboratory after April 3, 2007 will be required to bear the cost of their evaluation.
FOR FUTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Ms. April Giles, FIPS 201 Evaluation Program, GSA, 1800 F Street, NW, Stop 2013, Washington, DC, 20405, telephone: 202-501-1123, e-mail: april.giles@gsa.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background
Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), "Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors? requires agencies to use only information technology products and services that meet this standard. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has designated the GSA as the Executive Agent for government-wide acquisitions for the implementation of HSPD-12. HSPD 12 establishes the requirement for a mandatory Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government to its employees and contractors. OMB has directed Federal agencies to purchase only products and services that are compliant with the Federal policy, standards and numerous supporting technical specifications, including: 
? Federal Information Processing Standard 201, Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors; 
? National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications (SP) 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, 800-78 Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification, and 800-79, Guidelines for the Certification and Accreditation of PIV Card Issuing Organizations; and 
? Special Publication 800-76, Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification (Pending). 
To ensure standard HSPD-12 compliant products and services are available, NIST has issued requirements in FIPS 201 and supporting documentation (http://csrc.nist.gov/piv-program/fips201-support-docs.html).
As mandated by OMB through M05-24, GSA has been designated as the ?executive agent for Government-wide acquisitions of information technology" under section 5112(e) of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (40 U.S.C. ? 11302(e)) for the products and services required by the HSPD-12. GSA will ensure all approved Suppliers provide products and services that meet all applicable federal standards and requirements through its fully operational laboratory under the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program, web site found at (http://fips201ep.cio.gov/index.php)
The GSA FIPS 201 Evaluation Program is currently set up to evaluate products and services against the requirements outlined in FIPS 201 and its supporting documents. Twenty-two product/service categories were created using FIPS 201 and supporting documentation as the foundation. Each category has developed approval and test procedures which outline the evaluation criteria, approval mechanisms and test process employed by the laboratory during their evaluation of a Supplier?s product or service against the requirements for that category. Initially the cost of evaluating each product was funded by GSA. 
Once evaluated and approved by GSA, products and services are placed on the FIPS 201 Approved List. Agencies can then procure these products and services from Suppliers for their HSPD-12 implementations having full assurance that they meet all the requirements of FIPS 201 and all supporting documentation.

<SUBJECT>75 -- 75 - SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR OFFICE SUPPY PROVIDERS
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for market research purposes.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) is seeking vendors who can provide office supplies, on an as-needed basis, for the NIST Storeroom and Warehouse, located on the NIST Campus in Gaithersburg, MD.  

The NIST Storeroom and Warehouse is an 11,500 square foot facility, with a 2,700 square foot sales floor, located in Building 301 on the NIST Campus.  The Storeroom is a part of the NIST Administrative Services Division, Logistics Storeroom Section.  Their mission is to service customers better than anyone else could serve them and provide customers the highest quality, variety and convenience.  

The Storeroom stocks the following commodities for use by NIST personnel:   Electronics, Tools & Hardware, Electrical Supplies, Plumbing Supplies, Metals, Chemistry Products, Office Supplies, Building Materials, and Forms & Letterhead.  The Storeroom also maintains an on-line catalog to provide NIST personnel with current information on items available.

The commodity being sought out via this sources sought notice is Office Supplies.  Other commodities may be sought out via future notices.  This notice is not seeking vendors to facilitate the operation of the storeroom, but, to provide office supplies to stock the storeroom and provide bar coding of those office supplies on an as-needed basis.  

NIST spends approximately $400,000 per year to stock the storeroom with commercial office supplies.  Currently, the NIST/Acquisition Management Division (AMD) procures office supplies via individual Government Delivery Orders or Purchase Orders as quantities of different items are required.  While this process has been successful, AMD is evaluating the benefits of consolidating the procurement of each of these components in order to expedite the procurement process, as well as to obtain more significant discounts for these procurements that are inherent in long term contractual vehicles, up to five years in length.

NIST IS SEEKING SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES TO FULFILL THE REQUIREMENTS BELOW.  IF NIST IS ABLE TO LOCATE TWO OR MORE SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CAN SATISFY NIST?S NEEDS AT A FAIR MARKET VALUE, NIST WILL PROCEED WITH A SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  

IF TWO OR MORE SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES CANNOT BE LOCATED, NIST WILL PURSUE AN ALTERNATE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SET-ASIDE.  THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CATEGORY WILL BE DETERMINED AT A LATER DATE.
Vendors must be able to provide all of the following: 

1.	Commercial office products;   

2.	On-line ordering with the ability to print order acknowledgements and e-mail confirmation;

3.	The ability to bar code each UNIT with a NIST specific bar code.  This does not refer to the Universal Product Code (UPC) on all items.  NIST has a five (5) digit stock number, unique to each item of supply.  This 5 digit number must be 
applied to each unit purchased.

Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Departments networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of States enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that require two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>

Description

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside. The associated North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611710 with a small business size standard is $6.50 Million.  

A. Background Information

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a continuing need to train its field and headquarters operation al personnel in the basic legal aspects of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and related regulations.  A clear and consistent understanding of the laws, regulations, and legal precedents is essential to assure appropriate, uniform application of the administrative and compliance guidelines of the Agency.

The Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) staff is the field component of FDA and is engaged in investigative, scientific and compliance activities in support of the Agency's consumer safety protection mission.

Field personnel are the first line in gathering and reviewing evidence, maintaining its integrity, and recognizing its significance with respect to the laws enforced by FDA.  For a number of years, the ORA staff has coordinated the formalized basic food and drug law training of field and headquarters personnel and, as the coordinating unit, will assure continuity of effort in both training and performance.  Training in food and drug law is a major segment of a developmental program for newly hired investigators, inspectors, and analysts in the field.  Continuation of this quality training is essential in order for FDA to maintain a cadre of field and headquarters personnel sufficiently acquainted with FDA laws and regulations to enforce Agency policies and statues in a uniform manner.

FDA has a need to offer more advanced training for FDA staff of varying during and complexity.  For example, expertise needs to be presented in the import area, advanced applications of the FD&C Act and expertise pertaining to commodity assets that the FDA regulates, such as veterinary medicine, drugs, device, foods, and regulatory actions pertaining to the law such as seizures and injunctive actions, etc.

B. Objective

The principle objective is to provide FDA field and headquarters personnel with consistently presented basic and advanced training in the laws and regulations enforced by the Agency.

C. Scope of Work

The contractor shall supply necessary qualified personnel to provide instructional services at a minimum of three (3) or an estimated maximum of ten (10) courses ranging in duration of one week (five workdays), four (4) days and /or from 8-16 hours depending on the course.  Content covered includes food and drug law, basic and advanced, import regulations, injunction and seizure and aspects of the law pertaining to a particular commodity area, for example device, drug, foods , biologies or veterinary medicine.  These courses will be held at government selected sites for approximately 40 FDA students per course.  Up to 60 students may be assigned to the course at the discretion of the FDA Project Officer.  All sessions should be completed by September 2012.

Food Drug Law I and II Courses:  The class workday will run from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. Monday - Thursday and 8:00 A.M to 3:00 P.M. on Friday.  Review classes held in the evening will be proctored by FDA employees.  The contractor will provide a course review Friday morning from approximately 8:00 A.M. to 10:00 A.M., followed by a two hour test, one hour lunch and time allotted for test review.  

Scheduling evening sessions will be subject to completion of material during normal class day, and/or review of specific topics.  Courses not following the 5 day schedule will be contracted for specified number of hours and times depending on course and content.  The contractor will be notified at least 2 months before the course is announced to determine availability.  Contractor will be provided with course objectives and number of days/hours when confirming availability.

The contractor shall present courses in lecture/discussion format with approximately 85% of the time per day devoted to lecture and 15% to workshop modules and class discussion. FDA instructors/resource persons will be used as monitors and proctors and only participate in the program where their expertise is considered necessary by FDA to fully explain current and precedent Agency policy and procedures.

Each course shall cover the fundamental aspects of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and its implementing regulations, significant guidance documents, major judicial guidelines and opinions in this field, legal consequences of administrative actions and decisions, study of the government's burden of proof in court cases, and case development.  Content for some courses shall be more specific and geared to the audience needs.  Example content includes Untitled and Warning letters, Seizure, Injunction, Post Filing Activity/Coordinate Trial Preparations, Consent Decree/Order, Import Regulation; Veterinary Laws and Regulations.

There shall also be summary analyses of other acts enforced by the FDA including, but not limited to:

* Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act
* Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act
* Safe Medical Devices Act
* Generic Drug Enforcement Act
* Prescription Drug Marketing Act
* Nutritional Labeling Education Act
* Radiological Control for Health and Safety Act
* Title 18, Section 1001 Section 2 and Section 372

The majority of courses will be directed to students from field units who will need diversified rather than specific coverage of the FD&C Act.  Some courses, however, will be conducted for specific group disciplines, i.e., students working primarily in foods, medical devices, biological health, drug, biologic, or veterinary medicine.  The Contractor will be expected to appropriately adjust the agenda to accommodate the needs of the student audience.  Times for presentation will also vary depending on the audience and material to be covered.

The Food Drug Law I and II courses will be designed by the contractor with the use of an updated course outline provided by the Government that addresses our training needs through the use of the current textbook/workbook and current course materials, i.e., pre-course reading materials, quizzes and final testing mechanisms.   The course should be developed to include:

(a) A set of pre-course reading materials that will be distributed by the government tot he students prior to the course.  The pre-course materials should be reviewed once every six (6) months and updated and /or re-designed as appropriate.  The materials should provide the students with a basic understanding of the legal concepts within which FDA's enforcement policies and activities are framed.

(b) A complete course outline which shows the learning objectives established for each time module, and the identification of workshops and precedent cases to be discussed during lecture/seminar sessions.

(c) Lectures, workshops, or seminar discussion to illustrate application of the principles of the law explained during lecture presentation and plenary sessions to assure, as much as possible, a better understanding of the course content and goals through active involvement of all participants.

(d) A textbook/workbook (which may incorporate any or all information in the current textbook/workbook) to provide an additional record of learning/reference material for the participants which includes:
(i) Actual and hypothetical cases and case situations discussed or used as workshop exercises during the coach.
(ii) Copies of multimedia aids to be used as reference material by participants.
(iii) A testing mechanism on last day of the course designed to measure how effectively the learning objectives established for the course have been accomplished through the administration of written questions

Note:  The workbook will not contain copyright material and will be copied and distributed by the government.

(e) A review of the final test to reinforce learning objectives and clarify misunderstandings.  The Project Officer will determine the method of review.

(f) Course content will be targeted to a specific audience, e.g. imports, veterinary medicine, medical devices, and drugs.   Advanced applications of the Food Drug Law will be presented to the contractor at least two (2) months in advance in order for the contractor to prepare lectures and exercises based on defined objectives.  The Project Officer will send the contractor the course agenda listing times and days of presentation.  The number of hours may vary depending on course content.

(g) Contractor shall be reimbursed for actual time spent preparing for and presenting the course.

(h) Literature citations - FDA Law Syllabus, reprinted in FY 88.

The contractor will update the Food Draw Law I and II courses semi-annually to reflect changes required by judicial rulings, agency policy changes, or other substantial development in terms of the effectiveness of the learning experience of the students as identified by evaluations and critiques. 

FDA employees are called upon to defend regulatory actions taken against a firm in a court of law.  To prepare the employees for the types of questions that may be asked of an investigator, compliance officer or laboratory analyst, the contractor will be called upon to present a mock cross examination.  The cross-examination will be filmed by FDA so that employees may have access when needed to prepare for cross examination in a trial.  FDA employees will be used as trial participants.  The cross-examination may be part of a course and filmed during the course or may be filmed independently to provide maximum film production.

The Contractor shall make his/her own transportation/reservations including hotel and rental car as authorized by the Project Officer.  Receipts and invoice must be provided to the Contracting Officer for payment.

Contractor should not previously or presently be involved in lawsuits against the federal government.

D.	COMPENSATION
Compensation for Base Year (September 1, 2007 thorough August 31, 2008):  As consideration for the services described in the Statement of Work, the Government will pay the contractor the firm fixed price of $_________ per course.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial/supply and service  items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number AG-3187-S-07-0003 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15.  The clauses and provisions referenced in this solicitation can be found in full text format at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  This is not set-aside.  The small business size standard is $21.0 million.  The North American Industry Classification Code is 541618.  A quotation is requested for 
non-personal professional services and related work in compliance with its terms, specifications, and provisions.  The Contractor shall provide consultant services, analysis, documentation and recommendations using  best management practice decisions for the National Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) fee model and concessionaire tax requirements for the NRRS contract.  This includes furnishing labor, equipment, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals.  The awarded contract will be a firm fixed price contract (exclusive of travel) between approximately February 20, 2007, and May 4, 2007.  A draft report will be due April 6, 2007, and the final due May 4, 2007.  It is anticipated that most of the work will occur at the Contractor?s location.  Communication and information gathering will mostly occur via telephone and email.  There may be some site visits, which may include:  Washington DC, Rutland, VT or other field locations in the continental US.  One site visit is expected in conjunction with the annual NFRA conference in Reno, NV, March 12 ? 15, 2007.  This conference would afford the opportunity to discuss tax requirements with many Forest Service  concessionaires.  Contacts may include Forest Service and interagency personnel and concessionaires and NRRS management.  Travel costs must be approved by the COTR prior to incurring.  Line Item (01)  - Consultant Services and Report for NRRS Customer Fee Model and Taxes, One (1) Lump Sum.  Background:  The NRRS is the federal multi-agency reservation service that provides recreation reservation services for the USDA Forest Service, US Army Corps of Engineers, and Department of Interior agencies including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Reclamation.  Facilities and activities offering reservations in the NRRS consist of family campsites, group overnight campgrounds, cabins, lookouts, day-use shelters and group areas, tour/ticketing, and permits for entry into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW).  A) The NRRS contract allows for different Customer Fee Model approaches for use in paying contract costs, as follows:  (1)  The basic NRRS fee model is based on ?one fee ?, often referred to as a ?seamless? model in which the customer pays a recreation use fee with the intent  that the collected use fees cover not only the use of the facilities but the cost of the reservation.  The ?one fee? model is currently in use by the Corps of Engineers, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, and the Forest Service Alaska cabins.  There are approximately 866 field locations operating under this model in the NRRS.  (2) The NRRS also includes a separate reservation fee model, often referred to as the ?add-on? model in which the customer is charged a separate fee for a reservation, in addition to the use fee.  The separate reservation fee covers the cost of the reservation.  The separate reservation fee is currently $9.00 and is utilized only by the Forest Service and their participating concessionaires.  There are approximately 1,570 field locations operating under this model in the NRRS.  Agencies adopting the ?one fee? model have undertaken actions internally to revise their use fees in order to generate enough revenue to pay the reservation service fee cost to the contractor providing our service.  B) The NRRS contract requirements include the ability to record and track funds associated with concessionaire taxes.  In the Contractor?s operating software for the NRRS,  taxes with up to 10 different rates are configurable by agency, field location or revenue type and can be set up as either a tax-included or tax-extra model.  Further, all taxes are presented in all reservation data, confirmation letters and customer receipts.  Enhanced reporting provides complete revenue information including all applicable taxes to facilitate complete review and audit.  In addition, taxes may be managed from the federal, state or local level, from flat, per night to percent, from one half of the facility to the other.  Services include the following:  The Contractor shall provide research and  analysis for a report which determines the following and includes supporting statements for each recommendation:  1.  What fee model should the Forest Service use for paying for reservation services under the NRRS contract?  The separate ?add-on? model; the inclusive ?one fee? model; or continue to permit both models?  If the recommedation is to consoldate into one model (either the ?one-fee? model or the ?add-on model?), an implementation strategy shall be included in the report.  The analysis shall be of industry standards for fee models, and include the pros, cons, and potential risks of each alternative as it affects the Forest Service, the Forest Service  private concessionaires, and our customers.  2.  How should state and local taxes for concessionaires be accounted for, internally documented, and portrayed to the customer?  The analysis shall include legal requirements and industry standards, and include the pros, cons, and potential risk of the recommendation as it affects initially Forest Service concessionaires,  Forest Service policy and customers.   The analysis should also include a long-term view of the potential impacts and risks to other participating agencies concessionaires, policies and  customers.  All reports shall be submitted in an agreed upon format and  submitted in MS Word.  All documentation, analysis and recommendations  shall be delivered to:  John Cameron, NRRS COTR, Forest Service, USDA Forest Service, 325 John Knox Rd., Building F-100, Tallahassee, FL  32303-4061, jhcameron@fs.fed.us, 850-523-8589.  The FAR provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Offers submitted must include past performance information, resume of key personnel, approach and price.  Provide references for similar work during the past five years.  Specifically include experience that demonstrates a working knowledge of the Federal fee program, determination of fees, and other criteria that is utilized in setting recreation use fees.  Experience should also demonstrate an understanding and working knowledge of the Federal governments use of private concessionaires, permittees, and licensed private businesses that provide services on Federal lands.  The approach should outline, high level steps, to accomplish the tasks, not exceeding one to two pages.
Reimbursement for travel will be made for approved travel costs actually incurred, in accordance with Joint Travel Regulations, so price should not include travel costs, as a separate line item will be established.  Price is a lump sum firm fixed price.  Information such as hours, hourly rate, miscellenous, etc. should be included to support the lump sum price.  Contract award will be made to the offeor offering the best value considering past performance, experience, approach and price; with past performance, experience and approach when combined are more important than price.
