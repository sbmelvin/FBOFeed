The Government will relocate from existing space under lease if economics involved and other factors prove to be favorable.  The cost of moving, telecommunications, alterations, impact on agency mission and other variables to be determined by the Government, will be considered in the relocation decision in order to determine the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards and/or combine multiple space requirements.

OCCUPANCY:

Space must be ready for commencement of tenant alterations between Summer 2006 and Spring 2007.

DELINEATED AREA:

All properties offered to the Government in conjunction with this requirement must be located within a portion of BEXAR COUNTY, STATE OF TEXAS and will be further explained in the leasing SFO under “Area of Consideration”.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 17, Audie L. Murphy Memorial Division, 7400 Merton Minter Blvd., San Antonio, TX, intents to enter into a sole source deferred equipment purchase plan with Masimo Corporation. The plan will allow the use of the following Masimo’s technology and services at no charge for: Part # 1310/1708, Radical RDS1Oximeter, #1585/1708, Radical RDS3 Oximeter, 1884, Rad 5v Handheld Oximeter with DCSC, #1842, Handheld Protective Boot, Masimo Sat Share Cables; #12949, GE Tram Internal Upgrade; #13108, GE Dash Internal Upgrade; #1849, Philips Adapter Cables; #1811, Patient cables; #1708, brackets; #1895, LNCS TC-Itip Clip Reusable Sensors; #1863 LNCS SCI Adult Reusable Sensors and #1896 LNCS TF-I Forehead Reusable Sensors.  The above technology shall be provided at no charge with the understanding that this VA facility will purchase the Masimo’s LNCS ADT Adult Adhesive Sensors for use on this technology.  The Masimo technology allows conversion of the currently used pulse oximetry systems giving them the ability to use the Masimo’s LNCS ADT Adult Adhesive Sensors.  Masimo’s technology is accurate for conditions such as patient motion, low perfusion, and bright lights, which can confuse conventional pulse oximetry technology.  It has proven to reduce false alarms and improve detection of true alarms especially those encountered while monitoring ambulatory patients on general floors.  The Sensors and equipment contain Masimo’s proprietary software, and other proprietary information.  Ownership of the equipment will remain with Masimo Corporation.  This plan will be in effect for one year with one additional 12-month period. Either party may terminate this plan at any time with a 60 day written notice.

Interested parties have until August 11, 2006, 4:30 PM CST to submit their qualifications and capabilities in writing. Such qualifications and capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communication will not be accepted. If there are no responses to this notice within the time designated, this facility will commence with Masimo Corporation’s deferred equipment purchase plan. NAICS code is 3345100 and the  size standard is 500 employees. Fax information to the attention of Lupe Ybarra @(210) 949-3777.

<DESC>RFP 801816R323 will be awarded by Best Value (experience, past performance, hourly costs per discipliine).  Send Resumes and Hourly Rates for Base plus four Option Years.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is required to perform a status review for species that are listed pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) at five year intervals to determine if a change in the listing status of each species is warranted.  An essential part of the status review requires that a threat assessment be prepared for each listed species.  The Service is seeking a Contractor to immediately assist in gathering and synthesizing information that pertains to threats that may affect several of our listed species.  Service staff will use the threats assessment prepared by a contractor as they develop the 5-year status review.  A 5-year review serves to review and document relevant information on the species and its threats to determine if a change in listing status is warranted. The scope of the 5-year review may vary depending on the species and situation.  A 5-year review can be an in-depth status review, particularly if it is a wide-ranging species and a large amount of new information is available.  In some cases, there is limited information and an in-depth review is not necessary. It also should be noted that a 5-year review does not involve rulemaking; the review recommends whether or not to change the species' listing status, thus indicating that a rulemaking may be necessary.  A species classification cannot be changed until the rulemaking process is complete. This RFP is ONLY available electronically at:  http://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/login.jsp

This requirement is open to Total Small Business Set Asides.  The estimated price range is between $25,000.00 and $50,000.00.  The solicitation will be available by electronic posting only and may be found at www.fedbizopps.gov.

At this time, the magnitude of the five-year program consists of approximately 40 projects estimated over $7.5 Million and 90 projects estimated at below $7.5 Million.  Since the requirements are indefinite, actual program dynamics may increase or decrease the number of projects over the life of the contract; however, the program maximum for all contracts combined shall not exceed $1 billion.  The contract scope shall include design/build and traditional design/bid/build construction of new commissary facilities, addition/alteration (ADAL) to existing commissaries, new and ADAL to Central Distribution Centers & Retail Centers (Commissaries & Exchanges), in the United States to include Hawaii, and Alaska, and Guam and Puerto Rico, and other commissary locations where permitted by Host Nation agreements.  Other alternative methods of project delivery may be utilized after award.  The work will consist of providing all facility construction and equipment, including building equipment and operational equipment.  Particular emphasis is placed on refrigeration and HVAC systems in these facilities.  The abatement of hazardous materials will be a contract requirement on some projects, when such substances are present.  Subject acquisition will include a partial 8(a) set-aside for the Lower Valued National Contracts; the remainder will be solicited unrestricted.  In preparation for this acquisition, the government conducted a multi-step advisory process in accordance with the provisions of FAR Part 15.202, Advisory Multi-Step Process.  After evaluation of initial responses, the government identified potential respondents considered to be viable competitors.  Notwithstanding this presolicitation activity and advice provided by the government to potential competitors, the acquisition is now open to all offerors.  The government anticipates it will issue the final Request for Proposals for this acquisition on or about August 17, 2006.  Any questions and requests to be included on the distribution of the final Request for Proposal should be sent to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Alice Allen, at alice.allen@randolph.af.mil not later than August 16, 2006.  CBD Note 26 applies.

Solicitation 

The government intends to issue a Request for Proposals for Lower-Value National Contracts and for Larger-Value National Contracts on or about 17 August 2006, in accordance with FAR Part 15.  Closing date for receipt of offers will be approximately 29 Sep 2006.  In the Government’s efforts to promote competition, two separate categories have been established for Lower-Value National projects estimated less than $7.5 Million and Larger-Valued National projects greater than $7.5 Million.  Approximately five (5) basic contracts will be awarded per category for a total of approximately ten (10) separate contracts being awarded.  Of the approximately five (5) contracts anticipated to be awarded under the Lower-Valued National Contracts, one (1) to two (2) may be awarded under 8(a) set-aside procedures with the remaining contracts awarded via unrestricted competition.  All of the approximately five (5) Large-Value National Contracts will be awarded via unrestricted full and open competition.  Offerors must be capable of performing at all DeCA facilities within the national category to which they propose.  Be advised, however, that for the purposes of price evaluation, offerors will also be required to prepare a complete, firm, fixed-price offer on a sample task project for each category requested for consideration.  Additionally, the Government’s intent is to award each sample task; therefore, offerors must have the bonding capacity in aggregate of the sample tasks proposed.  Each Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract awarded will include a guaranteed minimum of $5,000 for the Lower-Value National Contracts.  Individual task orders will range from a nominal $100,000 to an estimated $7.5 Million.  The Large-Value National Contract task orders start at an estimated $7.5 Million and have the nominal upper limits for task orders indicated at $100 Million.  The procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15 and the Air Force Procedures for Source Selection, AFFARS Subpart 5315.3 and the Mandatory Procedures in MP5315.3.

 Proposals will be partially based on the sample task projected identified to the offerors for each category.  The proposed sample task for the Lower-Value National category is for construction of an architectural and refrigeration upgrade to the commissary at Camp Pendleton, CA, including complete replacement of all product refrigeration systems, including storage and display equipment, upgrade of sales area lighting, and reconfiguration of sales area HVAC systems.  The estimated price range for this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The proposed sample task order for the Large-Value National category is to replace commissary and exchange facilities that were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, August 2005.  The estimated price range for this project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.  Special Congressional appropriations are being set aside to accomplish this work.  This urgent and compelling project provides for design-build construction of a new retail shopping mall at Keesler AFB, MS to replace facilities damaged by Hurricane Katrina.  The new facility includes a new 165,200 SF 







exchange shopping mall complete with main exchange, food court, vendor mall, and garden sales and a 4,200 SF pharmacy with drive up windows.  The new facility also contains a new 97,000 SF full service commissary with a deli-bakery.  The project will provide 1,430 new parking spaces with associated vehicular traffic circulation roads, truck receiving areas, patron walkways, and site utilities and landscaping.  The project also includes phased demolition of the damaged facilities including the existing 151,000 SF exchange including the existing 4,200 SF pharmacy, the existing 97,000 SF commissary, and the 21,000 SF temporary commissary (former community club) to provide space for the new construction to take place.  The project will be offered for proposals at a conceptual design stage (approximately 30 percent designed) and the offerors will be required to propose on complete, turnkey, design-build construction of the required facilities.  The work will consist of providing all facility design, construction and equipment, including building equipment and operational equipment.  Particular emphasis is placed on refrigeration and HVAC systems in these facilities.  

Subject to the availability of funds, it is the intention of the government to award the sample task projects to the best value offeror in each category as the first Task Order under the basic contracts.  Unless specifically set-aside to meet 8(a) goals and objectives, or as provided in one of the exceptions listed in FAR Part 15.505, subsequent Task Order (TO) awards will be competed using the Fair Opportunity Clause provisions of FAR Part 16.505(b).  The selection of individual project contractors for each TO will be determined by a government approved selection clause that will be incorporated into each basic IDIQ contract.  The TO selection clause will include the criteria that will form the basis for contractor selection (e.g. past performance, schedule, capacity, price, achievement, or small business subcontracting goals, contractor and/or contractor and architect-engineer project team capabilities, technical proposals and other factors as may be defined).  Selection for Task Orders may also include a multi-phased approach where the contractors selected under this acquisition in the applicable category, are initially considered on price considerations (rough estimates) and other considerations as appropriate for the task order such as proposed approach, opportunities for economy and efficiency, past performance, schedule considerations, architect-engineer team capabilities, and other factors as may be defined.  After preliminary evaluation, the contractors most likely to submit highest value solutions may be selected for additional sessions with the government to increase their understanding of the requirements, provide suggestions for refining requirements and provide recommendations for risk reduction, among other considerations, prior to submitting final proposals.

The government is using this notice to also inform of its intent to use Non-government advisors, as necessary, to provide their expertise in an advisory role in the Request for Proposal preparation and issuance thereof and to provide advisory support in the source selection evaluation of proposals.  The contractor being utilized is Management Consulting Inc.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Maynard and Associates, Inc. 8008 Inverness Ridge Road, Potomac, Maryland 20854 services for the: Review and Analysis of NCI’s Active License Agreements.  

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.  The North American Industry Classification Code is 541199 and the business size standard is $6.5M. This requirement is set aside for small businesses. 

Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA), the NIH has a significant program in worldwide patenting and licensing inventions with commercial potential.  To date, this program has already generated through collaborative efforts many approved biopharmaceutical products to benefit the public health.  Over the past twenty-five (25) years the NCI, being the largest of the NIH institutes, has generated a significant invention, patent, license and alliance management portfolio.  
	
Recent studies on the management of license agreements have reported that license revenue remains one of the most poorly managed and underutilized asset in the United States.  For the NCI, proper management of its Intellectual Property (IP) license portfolio necessitates the implementation of a comprehensive assessment.  Therefore, NCI has a need for an effective appraisal of license agreements involving NCI lead inventor technologies to verify that milestones are met and patent reimbursement costs are paid in order to ensure that its inventions are being developed and that the Institute is being reimbursed for the funds expended to maintain patent protection.  In order to expedite the review and analysis of NCI’s license agreement portfolio, the Technology Transfer Branch (TTB) proposes hiring a contractor to read and review its commercial license agreements and Inter-Institutional Agreements (IIAs); determine if the agreement includes patent cost reimbursement; and identify milestones and payments described in the license agreement.  Minimum Contractor Qualifications:  1) Contractor shall have a J.D. degree with patent experience and/or be a patent agent and 2) Have at least two (2) years experience in the analysis of patent license terms and obligations.  

Maynard and Associates, Inc is the only known source that can provide the expertise needed in patent license portfolio inventory and regulatory drug review.  They have access to the NIH proprietary data software and are quite adept and skillful in acquiring resources and information for completing this sophisticated requirement.  Maynard and Associates has over twenty (20) years experience in patent licensing, regulatory drug review across NIH as well as experience working in law and with the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).  NCI’s patent license portfolio assessment is complex and spans over twenty five (25) active licenses which require very specific access to OTTs’ proprietary data software.  There are no known contractors to the NCI that can provide the expertise, experience and access to this proprietary data.  To bring another contractor to the NCI with the qualifications necessary to access this data would require extensive training in patent and licensing analysis and would be quite costly to the Government.    

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT on August 15, 2006 to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors’ responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email the aforementioned individual to insure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive and award, contractors must have valid registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) http://orca.bpn.gov. Please reference NCI-60120-NG on all correspondence. No collect calls.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Johnson Space Center (JSC) may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering of a space suit system to meet the needs of the Constellation Program.	Industry is invited to submit a response to this inquiry to assist NASA in the planning for the Constellation Space Suit System (CSSS) acquisition development. The contemplated CSSS procurement is not a follow-on effort to any existing contract.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. The initial Constellation Program missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are planned to begin as early as 2012, but no later than 2014.  The elements required for this phase include the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), necessary ground systems and a space suit system providing at least launch, entry and abort (LEA) and zero-gravity extravehicular activity (EVA) capability.	Lunar sortie missions are planned to begin as early as 2015, but no later than 2018.  The additional elements required for the lunar sortie phase include the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) and any additional space suit system elements required to support surface EVA. The Constellation Program will require the following space suit capabilities:  1) Crew protection and survivability during LEA scenarios (including spacecraft depressurization, egress mobility and water survival), 2) Zero-gravity EVA for in-space EVA (including contingency crew transfer between vehicles), 3) Surface EVA capability for lunar sortie missions (less than two weeks), 4) Surface EVA capability for lunar outpost missions (up to six months), and 5) EVA capability for Mars missions. While the capabilities above are similar to those that were provided by the Apollo suit, there are significant differences in the objectives for the Constellation Program.  Some of the objectives being contemplated include: minimize life cycle cost; minimize system operational overhead over the entire suit use cycle; minimize system mass, volume, and work-efficiency overhead; maximize unpressurized mobility to allow crewmembers to operate vehicle systems and to perform in emergency situations; maximize EVA capability while limiting impact on unpressurized suit volume, weight, comfort, and other attributes necessary to fulfill the crew survival function; maximize quick donning capabilities; accommodate the full-range of flight crew anthropometries while minimizing the required suit logistics; maximize reliability and minimize maintenance requirements; minimize operational/design constraints for conducting lunar surface operations with respect to geographical location and solar/thermal conditions.  Incorporate, where appropriate, design flexibility and modularity to allow for efficient incorporation of upgrades.  The Government believes that the packaging and inherent technologies of current or heritage flight systems will not adequately achieve these objectives.  The Government anticipates that new technologies and new schemes for packaging subsystems will be necessary for development of a multi-capability suit and has begun performing trades and maturing certain key technologies. NASA is considering a single space suit system to provide the space suit capabilities outlined above.  A single space suit system has the potential for savings in development, certification, and sustaining engineering costs, as well as reductions in required upmass and volume through commonality between the various elements of the space suit system.  The development of the space suit system will require several trades between use of common elements versus use of hardware designed uniquely to meet specific performance objectives.  The initial effort, referred to as Block I for ease of reference, would consist of the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering for elements of the space suit system necessary to provide LEA and zero-gravity contingency EVA capability for the CEV at a minimum.  The next phase of the effort, referred to as Block II, would consist of the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering for any additional elements of the space suit system necessary to support lunar sortie missions, as well as Block I mission capabilities.  The required capabilities include LEA (including long term survival in a depressurized spacecraft), zero-gravity contingency EVA and lunar surface sortie EVA capabilities.  Later phases of the space suit system effort will consist of the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering for elements necessary to support lunar outpost missions, as well as Block I and II mission capabilities.  Later phases/blocks may be developed to support Mars exploration.	If this approach is adopted, each block upgrade would be considered complete, in that the Government intends to only sustain one block version of the suit system at a time.   Additionally, the Government is contemplating including the ability to provide EVA capability to the ISS as a part of the Constellation Space Suit System.  This effort, referred to as Block IA, would provide zero-gravity EVA capability to support ISS maintenance and utilization EVAs similar to that currently provided by the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU).  Block IA will only be pursued if it offers advantages over the EMU in terms of cost or technical performance.  In order to maximize the potential cost benefits, Block IA should be targeted for delivery as soon as possible after Block I. NASA may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to support Block I and II in the second quarter of calendar year 2007.	NASA is contemplating requesting an option to provide the Block IA capabilities as a part of this RFP.  The Government may issue a solicitation or solicitations for a contract or contracts to support lunar outpost and Mars mission space suit capabilities at a later time. The Government is currently considering the following schedule for Blocks I and II: Block I and II System Readiness Review (SRR)	Apr 2007 RFP Release	May 2007 Contract Award	Nov 2007 Block I First Flight Ship Set Delivery	Feb 2013	Goal of 2011 Block II First Flight Ship Set Delivery Jun 2018	Goal of 2015 The Block I date of Feb 2013 represents the Government’s need date to support the planned first CEV mission to the ISS.  The goal date of 2011 represents the Government’s desire to accelerate the planned schedule for the first CEV mission to the ISS.  The Block II date of Jun 2018 represents the Government’s need date to support the planned first CEV lunar sortie mission.  The goal date of 2015 represents the Government’s desire to accelerate the planned schedule for the first CEV lunar sortie mission.       The Government has significant capabilities that could be utilized throughout the development of the space suit system.  These include expertise in EVA and LEA suit design and operations.   NASA continues to maintain a significant amount of in-house expertise specifically in the areas of advanced suit development, human rating testing, crew evaluation, sustaining engineering, and flight processing.  This experience also includes that of the ultimate end-user, the crew.  As opposed to other space flight hardware procurement efforts, suit development may be unique in that many aspects of the design are subjective and therefore development may require additional iterations to adequately incorporate crew considerations.  Also, the Government has unique facilities such as human rated vacuum chambers and ground test articles that might be utilized by the Contractor in support of human rating certification and training.  Further information pertaining to facilities that NASA can provide will be incorporated in the industry day presentations and published to the procurement website.  The Government is considering structuring the initial contract for the space suit system in a manner that will allow full and open competition for any follow-on contracts.  Therefore, it is expected that the contractor will provide to the Government all system drawings, construction documents, procedures, etc. developed under the contract.  While the Contractor shall be responsible for configuration management of all documents, copies of the documents shall be submitted to JSC’s document and drawing system upon approval.  The Government is expecting that all data and procedures developed under the initial contract will be owned by the Government and that there will be no proprietary designs or processes owned by the Contractor or its subcontractors for this suit system. The Government is seeking input on how to best implement the strategies outlined above.  Parties are asked to provide information on:  1)  Responder’s technical capability to design, develop, certify, produce, and sustain a space suit system to provide the multiple capabilities needed to support the Constellation Program.  2)  The technical feasibility and challenges in meeting the objectives for the space suit system.  3)  The recommended approach to developing and initially delivering at minimum the LEA and zero-gravity EVA and lunar sortie EVA capabilities. 4)  Comments and recommendations on the strategy to maintain system commonality including thoughts on elements of the system which might be common between the capabilities and comments on a strategy for certification of an evolving system.  5)  Comments on approach to maturing and infusing technologies needed to meet program objectives. 6) Suggestions on the optimal contract structure, including fee structure and optimal period of performance. 7)  Suggestions on how the capabilities resident in the Government would be utilized.  8)  Suggestions on how to implement the Government owned drawings and processes plan.  9)  Suggest a schedule that would provide the required suit capabilities to meet the planned ISS missions and lunar sortie missions, including interim milestone dates (i.e. CDR, certification, unit delivery, etc.).  Include discussion of the feasibility and risk assessment of accelerating the schedule to meet the Government goal dates (including comments on how early a lunar sortie capability meeting the program objective could be delivered).  10)  Contractor owned physical assets and facilities that could be used to meet the objectives.  11)  Comments regarding geographical location of Contractor products and services, and how you would interface with the project office and user located at JSC Houston, Texas during sustaining and processing project timeframe. 12) Comments on general approach, cost savings, schedule, and risks associated with delivery of ISS based zero-gravity EVA suit system).

GMD and MSC measurements from air samples collected at the Canadian Arctic station at Alert have previously been carefully compared by the two laboratories, providing a foundation for further collaborative measurements.  Collaborative measurements must be carried out in order for GMD to meet the North American goals of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program.  GMD requires the regular, long-term measurements discussed above, within a network of carefully chosen sites in North America, to study the variation of greenhouse gases with height, which will enable GMD and other scientists to quantify the predicted North American terrestrial biosphere’s net uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Quantifying the North American carbon budget and identifying implications for the global carbon cycle are priority items outlined in the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan.  Period of performance shall be October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007.  MSC operates the BERMS site in Canada where GMD requires these measurements to be carried out.  This site is a secure facility with limited access.  In addition, MSC already has personnel in place with the required expertise in the air sampling and analysis that is required.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and shall address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration solicits sources for COTS software and information technology support services required by the GSA Public Buildings Service.  If the results of this market survey indicate that there are at least 2 (two) or more potentially qualified sources that can support this requirement, the Government may consider the release of a competitive requirement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit information on IT services and support for commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) that will provide a web-based, workflow tool for overtime utilities estimating. 
  
The Public Buildings Service is the largest public real estate organization in the country and a provider of workspace and workplace solutions to more than 100 federal agencies representing over a million federal civilian workers in 2,000 communities.  This comprises over 1,600 government-owned buildings, or approximately 55 percent of GSA's total inventory. The remaining 45 percent is in privately owned leased facilities.
All PBS assets (which include human capital, technological resources and physical assets) are deployed in two fundamental activities. The first is space acquisition through new construction or leasing. This is a project management activity that translates customer agency’s space needs into discrete requirements, marshals the resources necessary to fulfill the requirements and manages the execution of the project, resulting in the delivery of workspace. The second is the life cycle asset management of the acquired space. This includes the physical supervision of the buildings in the portfolio; fulfillment of contractual obligations to our customer agencies; ensuring continuation of operations cycle-asset management of the acquired space; ensuring continuity of operations; determining prudent investment in maintaining a property and ultimately, when and by what means an asset will be disposed of at the end of its useful life.
Listed below are preliminary requirements that the Government desires in an application:

•	Designed and coded in an open, interoperable architecture that is extensible for future requirements.
•	Incorporates workflow to guide user(s) through process(es).
•	Automatically generate emails to notify users of next step in process(es).  
•	Provide a tool for an overtime utilities estimate for the Fiscal Year.
•	Provide the ability to integrate information with other web-based applications.
•	Web-based solution must accommodate approximately 300 users.
•	Automatically charge costs on a monthly basis.
•	Provide the ability to pro-rate costs.
•	Cross-check information for duplicate charges and will automatically flag duplicate charges.
•	Use estimates to auto-populate forms.
•	Archiving capability.
•	Generate audit trails.
•	Generate forms in both .html and .pdf form.  
•	Generate reports.
•	Provide system and user administration. 
•	Enforce access privileges based on defined user roles.
•	Validate user inputs against business rules.
•	Generate forms in both .html and .pdf form.  
•	Generate reports.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to Schmid & Partner Engineering AG (SPEAG), Zurich, Switzerland for DASY 5 scanning system.  SPEAG is the sole source for the following reasons:  

SPEAG is the only vendor with a scanning system that can accommodate the large volumes required, at least 2.5 by 2.0 by 1.0 meters. 

The probe (sensor) is the part of the scanning system that actually senses the electric or magnetic field.  The probe is precisely positioned by the scanning system where it transmits a voltage to the systems’ measurement electronics.  SPEAG is the only vendor whose scanning system is known to interface with third-party probes.

Precise positioning of the probe is required for repeatability of measurements.  The scanning system must be able to move the probe to any position in its range of motion with less than 1.73 mm of radical error.

For dosimetric evaluation both measurements and computations need to be performed in parallel for cross-validation of the results.  For this validation measurements need to be compared with simulation results and vice versa.  In addition to the DASY 5 scanning system SPEAG also offers the simulation software SEMCAD X, which already exists at FDA for computations.  DASY5 is the only system which provides import of measurement data automatically into SEMCAD X.  No other source is known to offer this feature.  SPEAG is the only vendor able to provide and test the import capability of the measured DASY 5 test data into SEMCAD X.  

NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by the fifth (5th) calendar day following the appearance of this announcement.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to Fred.Ettehadieh@fda.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.  An award will be made in five (5) calendar days from the date of this notice.  This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition for commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>USACE, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) proposes to issue a sole source award to Oregon State University, 306 Kerr Administration, Corvallis, OR 97331. A series of wave tests are to be conducted on a scaled physical model of the Lightweight Modular Causeway System (LMCS) being developed by the Engineer Research and Development Center.  In order to properly design this structure to be militarily useful, it  is necessary to conduct scaled model tests to determine the effects of waves on the structure and its ability to survive in elevated sea states.  An existing 1:3 scale model that was built to demonstrate the LMCS compactness, transportability, and abilit y to support a design load is available and optimal for use in such a laboratory study.   In order to expose the LMCS model to Sea State 3 wave conditions, a hydraulic test basin with capabilities/features as outlined below is required: (1) 3-dimensional  wave basin with dimensions large enough to accommodate a structure with 40ft x 8.5ft area footprint,  (2) A multidirectional spectral wave generator capable of producing maximum wave heights of 2ft with corresponding 3.5 second period (Simulates Sea State 3), (3) Water depth of 4ft is preferred, but a minimum of 3ft is sufficient, (4) Two consecutive weeks  of uninterrupted testing with on-site technical support staff, and (5) Experimental series must be completed by September 30, 2006. A firm-fixed price award will be made utilizing the Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Any other responsible source able t o provide the services is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 5 days after its publication. This is not a request for quotations and there is no solicitation available at this time.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is soliciting expressions of interest from potential partners to further develop and/or commercialize the technologies discussed below. Partnerships are anticipated to take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/or commercial licenses. CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Labs and licensed rights may be up to exclusive in a field-of-use, depending on the business case. Sandia is seeking partners that have proven experience in translating technologies into market-driven products, have technical capabilities in the technical area(s) discussed below, are fiscally sound and well managed, and can commit to manufacturing the products in the U.S.

A concept has been developed for reducing vibration in drillstrings while drilling in oil, gas, and geothermal reservoirs.  The technology development uses Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids, a suspension of micron–size iron particles within a carrier fluid such as water, oil, or silicone.  These iron particles respond to a magnetic field by aligning themselves along magnetic flux lines.  The stress necessary to displace the MR fluid is a function of the magnetic field strength in the fluid.  The controllable MR fluid-based damping system is coupled with an appropriate spring stiffness within a drilling sub and inserted into the drillstring near the bit at the base of the drillstring.  The system is autonomously powered and controlled by on-board electronics resident within the housing of the drilling sub.

Vibration in the bit of a drillstring produces a wavy surface in the rock that feeds back into the interaction between the bit and drillstring.  This system allows the reduction in vibrations in the drillstring through real–time control.  Vibrations are controlled by altering the damping forces through variation in a control voltage to the coil that generates the magnetic field.  Controlling the level of vibration reduces bit and drillstring and tool joint failures, increases drilling production rates, and reduces drilling costs.

Existing systems incorporating dampers are passive and configured before the bit enters the hole.  Accordingly, they are unable to respond to variability in drilling conditions.  Prototype controllable dampers have been developed at Sandia using MR fluid technology and tested in the laboratory.  They have shown that stable drilling conditions can be maintained when changes in the drilling lithology introduce vibrations into the drillstring.  Intellectual property (US Patent No. 7,036,612 B1) pertaining to the application of MR fluid technologies to the problem of drillstring vibrations has been granted to Sandia Corporation.

Interested parties may respond by contacting Teresa Garcia, Sandia Administration, Fax 505-844-8011; e-mail: tagarc1@sandia.gov.  Please include a brief description of your proposed type of partnership (CRADA or license) and any details you can provide as to specific requirements.

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), located in Kansas City, MO, intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for the purchase of six (6) dataloggers and associated accessories on a sole source basis with Campbell Scientific, Inc., of Logan, UT, based on the following reasons:  1) This is part of the Great Lakes Marine Network NWS Central Region is working in conjunction with NWS Eastern Region in establishing a Marine weather network, and are using the Campbell Scientific systems to keep the network consistent; 2) NWS Eastern Region purchased the first systems for the network from Campbell, and Central Region is following suit; 3) This will keep the programming of the systems, and logistics support much simpler and enable the use of one data format through the National Data Buoy Center in order to get it on the web; 4) Campbell Scientific, Inc. has a Federal Supply Schedule contract for 61% of equipment (GS-07F-9255S).  The balance of the equipment will be acquired through open market.  The following components are being acquired from Campbell Scientific through the Federal Supply Schedule program:  Basic Datalogger, model CR510-ST-MA-NC (P/N 16164-10), Temp Probe, model 107-L20 (P/N 10755-156), HDR GOES Transmitter, model TX312 (P/N 17844), 30db GPS Antenna (P/N 17992), TX312 GPS Antenna Cable, model 18017-L40 (P/N 18017-7)

Delivery:  three (3) full systems to Negaunee, MI, and one (1) full system each to Green Bay, WI; Duluth, MN; and Gaylord, MI.

Further the Government will consider the feasibility of providing such parts to Campbell Scientific as Government furnished equipment.

This republishing also includes the following change:  Information regarding Grants.gov has been included.  Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing.  No other changes have been made.

Technical POC/Program Manager, Mr. Jonathan C. Gregory, AFRL/IFEC, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-4294, email:  Jonathan.Gregory@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of information and sensor data analysis technology and associated sensors that will overcome deficiencies and enhance capabilities in existing and planned systems that support law enforcement and corrections efforts and the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center Northeast (NLECTC-NE.) The NLECTC-NE's mission is to work with government, industry, and academia to identify, evaluate, develop, demonstrate, and assess technology applications for law enforcement and corrections agencies. These efforts include, but are not limited to, concealed weapons detection, audio processing, video surveillance, facial recognition, timeline analysis, communications, communications and information systems interoperability, command and control, mobile and wireless computing, computer forensics, cyber crime, digital evidence handling, school safety, Integrated Border Enforcement Team (IBET), information management, and information storage, retrieval and exploitation. High level overviews of areas of interest for this BAA are in the following paragraphs. Concealed Weapons Detection (CWD) using either active or passive sensors is a priority for military personnel performing peacekeeping missions, law enforcement officers, and security personnel. Of interest are low cost technologies that can provide portable concealed weapons detection to include weapons with little or no metal content and explosives. Technology which could perform this at a standoff distances of at least ten meters and/or operate autonomously for weapons screening is also of interest. Also of interest are technologies to perform Through the Wall Surveillance (TWS) and Personnel Location and Tracking (PL&T). This includes the ability to detect, track and identify moving and stationary targets through building materials and rubble in the case of Urban Search and Rescue (US&R).  Technology development may include those generate a floor plan from outside of a structure as well.  The development of audio processing technologies to allow speaker identification, elimination of noise and/or multiple voices, enhancement and identification of background noise. Video surveillance technologies and tools to enable the acquisition, processing, storage, and enhancement of video data to support law enforcement activities, e.g., facial recognition, identification of individuals, vehicles, events, and interactions.  Timeline analysis technologies to provide both pattern/trend analysis for investigations, and to enhance logistics and planned coverage of regions for increased effectiveness of law enforcement resources. Timeline analysis tools to allow the user multiple customizable ways to display location, time, interaction and event data.  Communications research, development and demonstration of voice and data communications for public safety applications. Communications support voice, data, and "broadband" data (such as real-time video, geographic/map data and overlays, etc.), and can be transmitted via landline, radio frequencies, and/or microwave frequencies, both clear and encrypted. Mobile and wireless computing to provide a local data processing capability giving those in the field users a more responsive and interactive data accessing environment.  Geographic information tools and technologies are increasingly important for law enforcement in coordinating the response of resource and in the analysis of data and discovery of trends/patterns. Geospatial systems integrated into communications networks would assist command and control capabilities by directing messages to those elements which where able to effectively respond. For example, it could increase efficiency by providing information to those who need it, while filtering irrelevant information.  Interoperability is a key element of law enforcement/public safety operations. It is the ability to share/disseminate information to those who need it without impediments created by differing systems, offices, or organizations. Research and analysis of interoperability issues are critical to address early on to provide roadmaps for development and implementation which reduces the conflicts experienced when interfacing with dissimilar systems.  Enhancement of communications systems is an area of interest in this BAA. Communications systems can include private land mobile radio (LMR) systems, commercial services, and/or specialized systems such as wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and satellite communications. Advanced technologies including, but not limited to, software defined radios, voice over IP (VoIP), wireless LAN, 3G wireless data, ultra wideband communications, and mesh networks have the potential to significantly enhance law enforcement and public safety communications; part of this effort is to accelerate the process of transferring these technologies to the law enforcement/public safety market.  Computer Forensics, Cyber-crime: Perform applied research and prototype development in the digital forensic sciences for mission time-critical needs of military and civilian operational networks with spin-offs for the statute-driven law enforcement approach. Explore and apply scientifically proven methods to gather, process, and interpret digital evidence to 1) describe cyber-attack activities, enabling post-attack critical information data and infrastructure restoration, 2) correlate, interpret, and predict adversarial actions and their impact on military operations, and 3) ensure digital data scenario evidence has provable integrity appropriate for military defensive and offensive operations and, possibly, criminal investigations.  Information storage, management, retrieval, and exploitation are technologies that law enforcement, corrections, criminal justice, and public safety agencies increasingly rely upon. The information must be maintained securely while still allowing timely access and updating by multiple agencies/organizations. These systems also need to go types beyond the traditional text based systems to encompass additional and new data types, e.g. audio, video, geospatial. These systems must be able to integrate into the modern computing/networked environment.  Assessments of state-of-the-art of the technologies above will be performed and provided for law enforcement and corrections agencies. Technology demonstrations/evaluations will be accomplished in a real world environment.  Best practices and lessons learned of those evaluations will be fed back to technology development programs and disseminated to the criminal justice community.  In some cases, AFRL Rome may be able to provide further information. Contact the technical POC. The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate, Command and Control Engineering Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) applications.  Of particular interest are technologies that can significantly reduce the time between information technology availability and its employment into the research and development programs that support legacy and new military electronic systems.  Also of interest are commercial technologies that can improve the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and useability of these new and legacy military electronic systems.  Access to Rome Research Site laboratories, including such legacy systems as Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Master Caution Panel (MCP), Joint Air & Space Management & Deconfliction (JASMAD), and others, will be provided as necessary.  This effort will investigate the application and/or development of emerging and in-use commercial information technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas:  (1)  Legacy and evolving Air Force C4I systems:  This area covers not only technological upgrades to the existing Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) command and control structure/functions, but also revolutionary concepts for future operations centers, such as the Advanced Technology Air and Space Operations Center (AT-AOC).  Examples of the applicable technologies are advanced distributed architectures, publish/subscribe concepts and architectures, distributed computing environments, real-time processing, digital graphics, portable/wearable/mobile computational devices, and advanced displays/user interfaces.  (2)  Simulation and modeling technologies applicable to Air Force C4I systems:  Simulation and modeling for this purpose represent the full range of applications from supporting the development of the individual components within an Air Force C4I system to developing course of action evaluation tools to facilitate the AOC planning function.  Examples of these technologies include:  model abstraction, multi-resolution modeling, model interoperability, real-time simulation systems, advanced simulation architectures, C4I concept evaluations, long haul networked simulations utilizing HLA and other standard protocols, and application of these, or other, technologies to the concepts of rehearsal, dynamic planning/execution, and dynamic battle management.  (3)  Technology for integration, test, and demonstration of Air Force C4I systems:  systems integration and demonstration are used here to represent the spectrum of testing, evaluation, and demonstration that is typically conducted during the development, integration, and fielding phases of an Air Force C4I system and any of its component parts.  Examples of these technologies are those that are involved with the integration, measurement, assessment, and demonstration of information, Command and Control, communications, and enterprise systems as they relate to, or are part of, legacy and developing Air Force C4I systems.  (4)  Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems:  This area encompasses all information technology that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I systems/applications.  Examples of these technologies are data retrieval/mining, data storage, software/system monitors, data visualization, data busses, publish/subscribe mechanisms, digital moving maps, and decision making techniques.  (5)  Development of technology to enhance and enable the use of collaborative environments in AF C4ISR systems and enterprises:  This refers to development of individual collaboration tools, as well as the larger collaborative environment which results from networking the individual tools for simultaneous employment with multiple users that are widely dispersed.  Examples of these technologies are collaborative engineering and virtual prototyping environments which enable the collaborative development and application of information, air planning, and enterprise technologies/applications.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Sensors Directorate, Photonics Technology Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to advance the technology in the area of photonic components and systems.  Areas of interest include devices, components, techniques, systems and applications.  

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to analog modulation of optical carriers, efficient external modulators, highly linear modulators, phase modulation techniques, optical arbitrary waveform generation, low jitter pulsed lasers for analog to digital converters, near-zero linewidth lasers, optical signal processors, integration of photonic devices and circuits, system design and modeling.   Optical modulators operating at 1550 nanometers using polymer or semiconductor material systems are of prime interest for their potential for improving performance and manufacturability.  Lithium Niobate is another material system of interest that could be used to explore new ideas in areas such as linearization for high spur free dynamic range (SFDR) analog applications.  Specific modulator performance goals include a two-tone SFDR > 130 dB in a 1-Hz bandwidth, at a 10 GHz center frequency with a bandwidth > 3 GHz.  Issues of concern include ease of fabrication and fabrication tolerances, performance stability, insensitivity to temperature (over the range of -55C to 85C), low insertion loss (< 5db fiber-to-fiber), and the potential for extending performance to higher frequencies and wider bandwidths, (nominally 2 -20 GHz).  Optical arbitrary waveform generation includes the development of a robust, practical, stable octave-spanning optical oscillator, and its ability to independently encode (both via amplitude and phase modulation) a significant portion of the individual frequency components with an update rate approaching the mode-locked repetition rate.  Also of interest is the study of optical pulse shapes that benefit laser radar (LADAR) systems in terms of improvement of signal to noise and higher target detection probabilities.  

Deliverables will include technical reports, technology demonstrations which prove out the concepts proposed, and samples of components and devices developed.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Motion imagery and conventional imagery both provide visual data sources for intelligence gathering purposes through the use of various exploitation technologies and methodologies that demand high performance and dynamic operations to meet mission tasking and exploitation timelines.  Data formats, sensor type and spectral characteristics are the determining factors that dictate the exploitation technologies that will be required to process the data and extract the information to obtain the mission objectives.  The streaming video data format require different strategies for processing motion imagery over conventional two dimensional imaging sensors, but these sensors also differ with some being active or passive and spectral range of operation that require other processing and exploitation considerations.  Although motion imagery and conventional imagery have differing requirements with respect to the implementation of the processing strategies, the types of processing strategies can be very similar.  These imagery collection systems and the resultant data are exploited by teams of analysts, operational and warfighter personnel.  Exploitation often includes object or target detection, material identification and producing a report.  The goal of this research and development activity is to produce better tools and procedures to support exploitation operations in deriving more accurate and timely information from motion imagery and conventional imagery sources.  Specific areas include: 

Ability to ingest, visualize, process, exploit and output imagery products in standard and planned data formats for motion imagery and conventional imagery sources.  These formats shall include evolving new data structure and compression schema standards.

Improved procedures for performing graphics annotation to create embedded non-destructive graphic, symbology and textual layers to accompany motion imagery or conventional image data files in standardized formats.

Object tracking paradigms that provide technologies for continuous real time object tracking of both stationary and moving targets of opportunity.  These technologies shall address the conditions where the target is temporarily obscured by intervening objects or shadows and then reappears.  Tracking shall be accomplished through graphic, text and symbolic overlays and shall also calculate speed and direction parameters for the target.

Enhanced algorithms to perform feature extraction and image segmentation.  These algorithms are required to provide enclosed line segment boundaries outlining targets and objects of interest in order to compute statistics for characterizing the feature’s shape, size, material content and other identifying information for pattern recognition purposes and to support object tracking paradigms.

Optimized techniques for analysts to produce coherent change detection and two color multi-view products from synthetic aperture radar sources.

Refined spectral analysis capabilities to perform anomaly detection, surface material identification, atmospheric correction and the use of common signature libraries for multispectral and hyperspectral sensors.

Two-dimensional/three-dimensional visualization capabilities to support the presentation of multiple intelligence data sources, including motion imagery (e.g., visible, IR, etc.), imagery, maps, elevation data, text, graphics and symbology, in a common geospatial reference for exploitation purposes.

Effective methodologies for deriving accurate geo-positioning information and performing precise mensuration in which operations span the use of diverse data sets and evolving concepts such as smart images.

Software design and development strategies that follow accepted standards and provide intuitive motion imagery and conventional imagery exploitation tools for the analyst and implement and support Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) oriented scenario concepts such as publish and subscribe mechanisms.

The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

<DESC>This is Modification 2 in which quantities are adjusted downward.  This is a Request for Comments and Information notice.  The US Coast Guard, ARSC, EISD, Elizabeth City NC is seeking vendor comments on a proposed solicitation document including Support By the Hour, specifications and a general project summary.  The Support By the Hour document and Specifications are posted on the public USCG website at www.uscg.mil/HQ/arsc/solicitations.htm   Then scroll down to the EISD contracting page to HSCG38-06-RFI-EISD007.  Comments/questions/expressions of interest in this acquisition should be directed to Constance W. Cox, Contracting Officer, tele 252 335-6895, e-mail Constance.W.Cox@uscg.mil or FAX 252 335-6463.  First cutoff date for comments will be 15 August 2006.  While comments are not required for participation in the subsequent solicitation (estimated to be published within the next 60 days), comments from FSS/FLIR OEMS will be welcomed and considered.

The U.S Coast Guard (USCG) has identified a need to equip 46 rotary wing aircraft with capable and supportable Electro-Optical/Infrared Sensor Systems (FSS).  The USCG is publishing this request for information to provide potential suppliers with an opportunity to review and comment on the specification, support contract and objectives.  Supplier FSS proposals will be evaluated for changeability, supportability, performance and life cycle costs.  The supplier will be responsible for insuring performance for the life of the system as defined in the enclosed Coast Guard support by the hour (SBH) document.  A government team has reviewed EO/IR market survey data and Coast Guard operational requirements to develop the enclosed FSS performance specification.  The specification defines desired and required EO/IR capabilities.  Potential suppliers are encouraged to review the enclosed documents and provide written suggestions to the contracting officer.  

1.	Process
The Coast Guard is publishing EO/IR FLIR Sensor Systems (FSS) requirements documentation and will consider suggestions from qualified suppliers.  Suggestions must be received at the address listed below no later than 15 August 2006.  Advance copies may be sent by e-mail to Constance.W.Cox@uscg.mil (the contracting officer) including the following in the subject line ¡§FSS Specification Comments, Company Name¡¨.  Correspondence must include a company point of contact with address, phone number and email address.

The Coast Guard will revise the FSS documents based upon industry comments and publish a solicitation for FSS procurement.   The proposals will be evaluated by a Coast Guard Technical Evaluation Team with concurrent technical review and comment by NWSC Crane.  The target for the initial contract award is 15 November 2006.  The first article(s) will be required for evaluation on or about 15 February 2007.  First article tests will be performed both in the lab at NWSC Crane and in flight tests on Coast Guard aircraft.  Six systems will be procured as soon as possible.  Additional systems will be procured as funding becomes available.

2.	Scope
The FSS may be installed on any DHS aircraft.  The FSS will be installed on aircraft now operating without FLIR and the FSS will replace the FLIR systems currently in service on Coast Guard rotary wing aircraft. The requirement includes life cycle support, the EO/IR FSS system and recording capability.  The recording requirement may be a separate procurement from the FSS.  The support contract is intended for 46 Coast Guard aircraft.  Additional DHS aircraft may added as required.

3.	Background
The Coast Guard currently operates (99) H-65 and (41) H-60 aircraft.  These aircraft require sensor improvements to support Coast Guard¡¦s Statutory Mission Requirements (e.g. SAR, MDA, HLS, & ELT).  A requirement for airborne use of force (AUF) capability for Coast Guard helicopters is evolving rapidly.  AUF equipment, including the FSS, will be installed in all H-60 aircraft and, initially, a subset of the H-65 fleet.  There is an immediate need to equip six H-65 aircraft for operations in the fall of 2007 to support critical Airborne Use of Force national security requirements.  Current plans call for a maximum of 46 Airborne Use of Force aircraft equipped with FSS. 

The Coast Guard has identified the need to improve on typical industry support plans for FLIR systems.  The Coast Guard has over 20 years of experience with maintenance and repair support by the hour (SBH) for engines and avionics components.  The FSS SBH document was defined based on the successful support by the hour (SBH) agreements currently utilized by the Coast Guard.

4.	Objectives

4.1	Support
The Coast Guard support requirements are defined in the attached Support By the Hour (SBH) document.  Coast Guard aircraft operate in a demanding environment.  SBH is intended to insure the FSS is supported in the Coast Guard operating environment.  SBH is intended to align the supplier and Coast Guard interests to provide fully mission capable systems available for Coast Guard operations.  The supplier is responsible for the performance of their product.  SBH provides a framework for the Coast Guard and supplier partnership for the life of the FSS.  The Coast Guard will consider suggestions for modifications to the SBH plan.  Suppliers will be allowed to offer alternative support plans.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to provide additional information on the TDP  and the Solicitation.  Please note the changes to the solicitation as noted  below. In regard to the TDP: 1)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P7 â€“ Where is the data for this booklet?  Is this GFM?      The operatorâ€™s instruction pamphlet will be provided as GFM. 2)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P8 â€“ Is this leakage test required at the final LAP level or  at the ammo can vendor level?       The leakage test is required at the final LAP level 3)  DWG 932241 â€“ Olin is the only approved source.  We are aware that Olin has been running at capacity for several months filling contractors requirements  for 40mm M781.  What is TACOMâ€™s view on allowing other sources?      The TDP is for informational proposes only.  The round has to meet the  Performance Specification provided in the Solicitation.  Note that currently  Olin is the only .38 Caliber Case vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;  another vendor may be qualified in the future.   4)DWG 9275763 â€“ Why is this drawing in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded. 5)DWG 9345327 â€“ Same question as question #1      Currently Olin is the only primer vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;another vendor may be qualified in the future.  6)HCSDS 643 â€“ Why is this in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded.   7) The drawing for the silhouette was not provided with the TDP.      Drawing number 6006874 entitled Target Silhouette â€œEâ€ Kneeling is not part of the TDP.  Please send an email to kgorman@pica.army.mil to request a copy. 8)Is there a TDPL?      The TDPL is Document: 06BBH210A on the CD.  You may right click on the CD  and hit the explore option.  There is a version of the TDPL (06BBH210A) in  Adobe and in WordPad.  You may access the TDPL using either of the two programs.  9)Is there a drawing or more information about the tube the rounds are  placed in with the ammo can?      The dimensions of the tube are in lower right side of drawing 9209204.  In  the upper left side of the same drawing there is a â€œLIST OF PARTSâ€ box.  Line #12 and remarks C and F under the list of parts box give the specifications the  tubes are governed by.  If you look up the specifications it will give further  information on how the tube should be constructed. In regard to the solicitation: 1)Page 1 of 101 â€“ the Government says see schedule for deliver.  We  believe it says later F.O.B. origin. Please confirm with location.      Reference page 14 for Delivery information.  All items are F.O.B Origin. 2)Page 1 of 101- The government has identified the NAISC code as 332992.   Is this correct.  Ammunition over 30mm is typically 332993.        Reference page 1 block 10 and page 6 paragraph 5, the NAICS code shall be  corrected to state 332993,  the Size Standard Shall remain 1500.    3)Page 1 (& 67) of 101 â€“ The Government has identified this contract as  a small business set aside.  What is the governmentâ€™s interpretation of the  employee size and annual sales as it applies to small business and this SIC code?  What is the government interpretation in regard to subsidiaries, joint  ventures, etc.  What is the governments level of interest in ensuring that this  is awarded to true small business?  Will there be any requirement or  investigation beyond the standard SBA response of â€˜self certificationâ€™ without  independent 3rd party evaluation.        Since this solicitation involves furnishing a manufactured product, the size standard is stated in number of employees (in this solicitation that is 1,500), there is no annual sales figure involved.  The employees of any company  affiliated with an offeror (whether it is a parent company, sister company,  subsidiary, etc.) would have to be included in the total employee count.  In  federal acquisition there is no certification process for small business other  than self certification. Therefore an independent 3rd party evaluation will not  be a requirement.  However, any interested party can initiate a size protest if  the size of a business is in question.    4)Page 10 of 101 â€“ CLINs 0005 through 0009 require that the contractor  must produce at a minimum rate of 40,000 per month, yet the first pricing tier  could be only 50,000 units.  Therefore the contractor would have to produce  40,000 the first month and then 10,000 the next month.  Is it not possible to split the award quantity over a span that would allow for continuous production  for a few months?      It is possible that the award will spread out to allow for continuous  production for a few months.  However, for bidding purposes assume a minimum  rate 40,000 per month. In your example this would mean 40,000 the first month  and then 10,000 the next month. 5)Page 10 of 101 â€“ In the situation noted above the contractor could be idle for several months of a continuous 12 month period.  From the point of  award of option 2, after being idle several months, what is the expected ramp  up timeframe?      Depending on if we exercise the Max. Range or not, the typical ramp-up  time for full-scale production would be 6 to 8 months for a small Contractor. 6)Page 10 of 101 â€“ Will the contractor be allow to deliver at amounts  greater than 40,000 in advance of actual delivery requirements?      The contractor is required to submit a proposal based on the delivery  schedule and quantity in the solicitation.  However, after contract award this  issue could be readdressed.  7)Page 21 of 101 â€“ States Bars codes required.  Attachment 8 and age 59  says 2D barcode.  Is not all DOD now 3D bar code required?        The 2D barcode is correct. 8)In response to question 1 regarding the TDP DWG 9209204 â€“ P7, Page 21 of  101- States no Government Furnish Property shall be provided.  This shall be  modified to state Government Furnished Property shall be provided since the Government will be providing the operatorâ€™s instructions pamphlet.  On page 23- of 101 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property Short Form shall be added to this  solicitation 9)  Page 25 of the solicitation AIE Clause (ARDEC 34) paragraph b.  states â€œ(except for any AIE listed as available in section H or appendix I)â€.  We are unable to find Section H or Appendix I.       Since this is a commercial contract not subject to the uniform contract  format (UCF), there are no sections.  Please reference page 16 for a basic  guide when clauses reference a UCF section.  In ARDEC 34 which reference H or  appendix I (52.212-1  or 52.212-4), there is no AIE listed as available in the  referenced sections.   10)Page 31 of 101 â€“ Does TACOM have MSDS from current inventory of M1006?        There is no MSDS for the M1006. 11)Page 33 of 101-The schedule listed on Page 14 of the solicitation  identified First Article being required 210 Days ADC. The First Article â€“  Contractor Testing Clause found on page 33 identifies a 180 day requirement for  submittal of the FAT report.      Page 34 shall be corrected to read 210 calendar days.  12)Page 44 of 101- 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation- Is it a requirement to have unique item identifiers on each ammunition?     A unique item identifier is not required on the individual ammunitions.  The solicitation shall be revised to remove items listed under 252.211-7003 (c)  (1)(ii). 13)  Page 58 of 101 â€“ 3.1.3 Design Verification Test â€“ If this is the  governmentsâ€™ design/TDP in what instances will a DVT be required or not required?      If the item has been produced before to the technical data package that  the vendor is to use and there have not been any modifications to the design (i.e. Engineering Changes), then the DVT could in theory be waived or just not  conducted.  We would still need to ascertain whether or not the vendorâ€™s  process is capable or â€œrobustâ€ because this is his/her first time producing the  item and First Article Testing (with subsequent Lot Acceptance Testing) is the vehicle to use to do that.  14)  Page 87 of 101 â€“ under proposal format Part â€“B design format.  What is  there a design element if there is a full and functional TDP without clear new  design parameters?      The TDP is for informational purposes only.  When proposing, it is not  required that one build to the TDP.  One can utilize their own design built to  the performance specification.   15)  Page 87 of 101-There are issues with the requirements for the number of  volumes and copies required to be submitted for this solicitation. Page 87 says  Proposal Format a) the proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set  forth in the table below. The table describes four volumes to be submitted.

Also Directions for submittal of Volume 4  (Price/Cost) listed on page 87, paragraph d contradict the requirements listed  for the submission of Volume 4 listed on page 91.       Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Instructions paragraph b shall be revised to state â€œOriginal and four paper copies of Technical, Management Factor and  Past Performance.â€  Paragraph d shall be revised to state â€œTwo electronic  copies of (c) aboveâ€¦..â€  Page 91 of 101 is correct as stated.  17)  Page 89 of 101 - Volume I, Technical part C: Is the listed information  required, if contractor has an up-to-date ISO 9001-2000 Certification, e.g.  design of inspection and testing equipment, quality system plan, etc.?      Reference page 82 of 101 ARDEC 148 Offerorâ€™s Quality Assurance System (b) (1). If you indicate in your response to this solicitation that your quality  system conforms to one of the listed standards in Section E â€“ Higher Level  Contract Quality Requirement FAR 52.246-11, this is a sufficient description. You need not further describe your quality system in your response to the solicitation. 18)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Where do we get copies of ARDEC 148 and ARDEC 34?    As stated on page 22 of 101, Clauses incorporated by reference can be accessed at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Click on local link and select local  clauses.  The clauses are listed in numeric order. 19)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Part B â€“ (b) â€“ To supply test reports and data implies  that the contract must have already produced the round.  Is it a requirement of  the contract that the bidder have produced the round previously?        We are not requiring the round to have been previously produced.  The M1006 solicitation is based on the provided Performance Specification.  The bidder may answer the solicitation with a round that meets the requirements outlined in the Performance Specification.  In the event that another round other than the M1006 is submitted ARDEC would like to review any test data as outlined in the Performance Specification for the round being submitted.  The M1006 has test data generated from previous qualification testing.   20)  Page 89 of 101 - Proposal Instructions, item a) refers to Contract Data  requirements List (DD Form 1423 with blocks 17 and 18 completed).  DD Form 1423  has no Blocks 17 and 18.     Block 17. Price Group and 18. Estimated total price are located in the right margin of the CDLR. 21)  Page 90 of 101- States Volume II Management Factor consists of 3 Parts.  Only two parts Part A and Part B are listed. Please Clarify.    Page 90 of 101 shall be corrected to stated Volume II-Management Factor  Consists of 2 parts. 22)  Page 92 of 101 â€“ Does the government have a spreadsheet like this it is  could provide to all contractors, so that there are no formula or mathematical  errors that could adversely effect the award of the contract?     It is not necessary for the Government to supply this spreadsheet to all  contractors.  This is just a sample of how the weighted guidelines will be  computed.  When submitting a proposal one only need to provide a price for each  line item and quantity range.  The Governmentâ€™s Price analysis will perform the  weighted average analysis for total price. 23)  Page 98 of 101 â€“ Evaluation of offers TDP.  Please explain what there is a  separate TDP from the government supplied TDP?     One can submit a technical data package based on the performance  specifications.

I.E. â€“ If  we discuss additional quality aspects outside of the quality section (Technical Factor, Part C) as they relate to another area will these comments be included  in the overall evaluation?  If not, MAST may have to be more repetitive to  ensure that each section has adequate content.        When submitting the proposal it is best to be as clear as possible.  Iâ€™d  suggest addressing each section as a stand alone.  If this is not practicable,  please reference the specific.   26)  General-This solicitation includes a performance specification and  drawings.  Does our submission have to meet the performance specification only  and are we free to use our design?  Alternatively, must we adhere to the  supplied drawings and the performance specification?       The item does need to meet the performance specification. You may use your own design, however, it still must meet the requirements in the performance spec.The technical data package (TDP) is for informational purposes only.  You can choose to design to the TDP, but it is not a requirement of this solicitation.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to provide additional information on the TDP  and the Solicitation.  Please note the changes to the solicitation as noted  below. In regard to the TDP: 1)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P7 â€“ Where is the data for this booklet?  Is this GFM?      The operatorâ€™s instruction pamphlet will be provided as GFM. 2)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P8 â€“ Is this leakage test required at the final LAP level or  at the ammo can vendor level?       The leakage test is required at the final LAP level 3)  DWG 932241 â€“ Olin is the only approved source.  We are aware that Olin has been running at capacity for several months filling contractors requirements  for 40mm M781.  What is TACOMâ€™s view on allowing other sources?      The TDP is for informational proposes only.  The round has to meet the  Performance Specification provided in the Solicitation.  Note that currently  Olin is the only .38 Caliber Case vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;  another vendor may be qualified in the future.   4)DWG 9275763 â€“ Why is this drawing in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded. 5)DWG 9345327 â€“ Same question as question #1      Currently Olin is the only primer vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;another vendor may be qualified in the future.  6)HCSDS 643 â€“ Why is this in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded.   7) The drawing for the silhouette was not provided with the TDP.      Drawing number 6006874 entitled Target Silhouette â€œEâ€ Kneeling is not part of the TDP.  Please send an email to kgorman@pica.army.mil to request a copy. 8)Is there a TDPL?      The TDPL is Document: 06BBH210A on the CD.  You may right click on the CD  and hit the explore option.  There is a version of the TDPL (06BBH210A) in  Adobe and in WordPad.  You may access the TDPL using either of the two programs.  9)Is there a drawing or more information about the tube the rounds are  placed in with the ammo can?      The dimensions of the tube are in lower right side of drawing 9209204.  In  the upper left side of the same drawing there is a â€œLIST OF PARTSâ€ box.  Line #12 and remarks C and F under the list of parts box give the specifications the  tubes are governed by.  If you look up the specifications it will give further  information on how the tube should be constructed. In regard to the solicitation: 1)Page 1 of 101 â€“ the Government says see schedule for deliver.  We  believe it says later F.O.B. origin. Please confirm with location.      Reference page 14 for Delivery information.  All items are F.O.B Origin. 2)Page 1 of 101- The government has identified the NAISC code as 332992.   Is this correct.  Ammunition over 30mm is typically 332993.        Reference page 1 block 10 and page 6 paragraph 5, the NAICS code shall be  corrected to state 332993,  the Size Standard Shall remain 1500.    3)Page 1 (& 67) of 101 â€“ The Government has identified this contract as  a small business set aside.  What is the governmentâ€™s interpretation of the  employee size and annual sales as it applies to small business and this SIC code?  What is the government interpretation in regard to subsidiaries, joint  ventures, etc.  What is the governments level of interest in ensuring that this  is awarded to true small business?  Will there be any requirement or  investigation beyond the standard SBA response of â€˜self certificationâ€™ without  independent 3rd party evaluation.        Since this solicitation involves furnishing a manufactured product, the size standard is stated in number of employees (in this solicitation that is 1,500), there is no annual sales figure involved.  The employees of any company  affiliated with an offeror (whether it is a parent company, sister company,  subsidiary, etc.) would have to be included in the total employee count.  In  federal acquisition there is no certification process for small business other  than self certification. Therefore an independent 3rd party evaluation will not  be a requirement.  However, any interested party can initiate a size protest if  the size of a business is in question.    4)Page 10 of 101 â€“ CLINs 0005 through 0009 require that the contractor  must produce at a minimum rate of 40,000 per month, yet the first pricing tier  could be only 50,000 units.  Therefore the contractor would have to produce  40,000 the first month and then 10,000 the next month.  Is it not possible to split the award quantity over a span that would allow for continuous production  for a few months?      It is possible that the award will spread out to allow for continuous  production for a few months.  However, for bidding purposes assume a minimum  rate 40,000 per month. In your example this would mean 40,000 the first month  and then 10,000 the next month. 5)Page 10 of 101 â€“ In the situation noted above the contractor could be idle for several months of a continuous 12 month period.  From the point of  award of option 2, after being idle several months, what is the expected ramp  up timeframe?      Depending on if we exercise the Max. Range or not, the typical ramp-up  time for full-scale production would be 6 to 8 months for a small Contractor. 6)Page 10 of 101 â€“ Will the contractor be allow to deliver at amounts  greater than 40,000 in advance of actual delivery requirements?      The contractor is required to submit a proposal based on the delivery  schedule and quantity in the solicitation.  However, after contract award this  issue could be readdressed.  7)Page 21 of 101 â€“ States Bars codes required.  Attachment 8 and age 59  says 2D barcode.  Is not all DOD now 3D bar code required?        The 2D barcode is correct. 8)In response to question 1 regarding the TDP DWG 9209204 â€“ P7, Page 21 of  101- States no Government Furnish Property shall be provided.  This shall be  modified to state Government Furnished Property shall be provided since the Government will be providing the operatorâ€™s instructions pamphlet.  On page 23- of 101 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property Short Form shall be added to this  solicitation 9)  Page 25 of the solicitation AIE Clause (ARDEC 34) paragraph b.  states â€œ(except for any AIE listed as available in section H or appendix I)â€.  We are unable to find Section H or Appendix I.       Since this is a commercial contract not subject to the uniform contract  format (UCF), there are no sections.

There is no MSDS for the M1006. 11)Page 33 of 101-The schedule listed on Page 14 of the solicitation  identified First Article being required 210 Days ADC. The First Article â€“  Contractor Testing Clause found on page 33 identifies a 180 day requirement for  submittal of the FAT report.      Page 34 shall be corrected to read 210 calendar days.  12)Page 44 of 101- 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation- Is it a requirement to have unique item identifiers on each ammunition?     A unique item identifier is not required on the individual ammunitions.  The solicitation shall be revised to remove items listed under 252.211-7003 (c)  (1)(ii). 13)  Page 58 of 101 â€“ 3.1.3 Design Verification Test â€“ If this is the  governmentsâ€™ design/TDP in what instances will a DVT be required or not required?

What is  there a design element if there is a full and functional TDP without clear new  design parameters?      The TDP is for informational purposes only.  When proposing, it is not  required that one build to the TDP.

The employees of any company  affiliated with an offeror (whether it is a parent company, sister company,  subsidiary, etc.) would have to be included in the total employee count.  In  federal acquisition there is no certification process for small business other  than self certification. Therefore an independent 3rd party evaluation will not  be a requirement.  However, any interested party can initiate a size protest if  the size of a business is in question.    4)Page 10 of 101 â€“ CLINs 0005 through 0009 require that the contractor  must produce at a minimum rate of 40,000 per month, yet the first pricing tier  could be only 50,000 units.  Therefore the contractor would have to produce  40,000 the first month and then 10,000 the next month.  Is it not possible to split the award quantity over a span that would allow for continuous production  for a few months?      It is possible that the award will spread out to allow for continuous  production for a few months.  However, for bidding purposes assume a minimum  rate 40,000 per month. In your example this would mean 40,000 the first month  and then 10,000 the next month. 5)Page 10 of 101 â€“ In the situation noted above the contractor could be idle for several months of a continuous 12 month period.  From the point of  award of option 2, after being idle several months, what is the expected ramp  up timeframe?      Depending on if we exercise the Max. Range or not, the typical ramp-up  time for full-scale production would be 6 to 8 months for a small Contractor. 6)Page 10 of 101 â€“ Will the contractor be allow to deliver at amounts  greater than 40,000 in advance of actual delivery requirements?      The contractor is required to submit a proposal based on the delivery  schedule and quantity in the solicitation.  However, after contract award this  issue could be readdressed.  7)Page 21 of 101 â€“ States Bars codes required.  Attachment 8 and age 59  says 2D barcode.  Is not all DOD now 3D bar code required?        The 2D barcode is correct. 8)In response to question 1 regarding the TDP DWG 9209204 â€“ P7, Page 21 of  101- States no Government Furnish Property shall be provided.  This shall be  modified to state Government Furnished Property shall be provided since the Government will be providing the operatorâ€™s instructions pamphlet.  On page 23- of 101 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property Short Form shall be added to this  solicitation 9)  Page 25 of the solicitation AIE Clause (ARDEC 34) paragraph b.  states â€œ(except for any AIE listed as available in section H or appendix I)â€.  We are unable to find Section H or Appendix I.       Since this is a commercial contract not subject to the uniform contract  format (UCF), there are no sections.  Please reference page 16 for a basic  guide when clauses reference a UCF section.  In ARDEC 34 which reference H or  appendix I (52.212-1  or 52.212-4), there is no AIE listed as available in the  referenced sections.   10)Page 31 of 101 â€“ Does TACOM have MSDS from current inventory of M1006?        There is no MSDS for the M1006. 11)Page 33 of 101-The schedule listed on Page 14 of the solicitation  identified First Article being required 210 Days ADC. The First Article â€“  Contractor Testing Clause found on page 33 identifies a 180 day requirement for  submittal of the FAT report.      Page 34 shall be corrected to read 210 calendar days.  12)Page 44 of 101- 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation- Is it a requirement to have unique item identifiers on each ammunition?     A unique item identifier is not required on the individual ammunitions.  The solicitation shall be revised to remove items listed under 252.211-7003 (c)  (1)(ii). 13)  Page 58 of 101 â€“ 3.1.3 Design Verification Test â€“ If this is the  governmentsâ€™ design/TDP in what instances will a DVT be required or not required?      If the item has been produced before to the technical data package that  the vendor is to use and there have not been any modifications to the design (i.e. Engineering Changes), then the DVT could in theory be waived or just not  conducted.  We would still need to ascertain whether or not the vendorâ€™s  process is capable or â€œrobustâ€ because this is his/her first time producing the  item and First Article Testing (with subsequent Lot Acceptance Testing) is the vehicle to use to do that.  14)  Page 87 of 101 â€“ under proposal format Part â€“B design format.  What is  there a design element if there is a full and functional TDP without clear new  design parameters?      The TDP is for informational purposes only.  When proposing, it is not  required that one build to the TDP.  One can utilize their own design built to  the performance specification.   15)  Page 87 of 101-There are issues with the requirements for the number of  volumes and copies required to be submitted for this solicitation. Page 87 says  Proposal Format a) the proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set  forth in the table below. The table describes four volumes to be submitted.        Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Format paragraph a) shall be revised to  state â€œThe proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set forth in the  table below.â€ 16)  Page 87 of 101-Lists the quantities for Volumes 1,3, & 4 but no requirements for Volume 2.  Also Directions for submittal of Volume 4  (Price/Cost) listed on page 87, paragraph d contradict the requirements listed  for the submission of Volume 4 listed on page 91.       Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Instructions paragraph b shall be revised to state â€œOriginal and four paper copies of Technical, Management Factor and  Past Performance.â€  Paragraph d shall be revised to state â€œTwo electronic  copies of (c) aboveâ€¦..â€  Page 91 of 101 is correct as stated.  17)  Page 89 of 101 - Volume I, Technical part C: Is the listed information  required, if contractor has an up-to-date ISO 9001-2000 Certification, e.g.  design of inspection and testing equipment, quality system plan, etc.?      Reference page 82 of 101 ARDEC 148 Offerorâ€™s Quality Assurance System (b) (1). If you indicate in your response to this solicitation that your quality  system conforms to one of the listed standards in Section E â€“ Higher Level  Contract Quality Requirement FAR 52.246-11, this is a sufficient description. You need not further describe your quality system in your response to the solicitation. 18)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Where do we get copies of ARDEC 148 and ARDEC 34?    As stated on page 22 of 101, Clauses incorporated by reference can be accessed at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Click on local link and select local  clauses.  The clauses are listed in numeric order. 19)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Part B â€“ (b) â€“ To supply test reports and data implies  that the contract must have already produced the round.  Is it a requirement of  the contract that the bidder have produced the round previously?        We are not requiring the round to have been previously produced.  The M1006 solicitation is based on the provided Performance Specification.  The bidder may answer the solicitation with a round that meets the requirements outlined in the Performance Specification.  In the event that another round other than the M1006 is submitted ARDEC would like to review any test data as outlined in the Performance Specification for the round being submitted.  The M1006 has test data generated from previous qualification testing.   20)  Page 89 of 101 - Proposal Instructions, item a) refers to Contract Data  requirements List (DD Form 1423 with blocks 17 and 18 completed).  DD Form 1423  has no Blocks 17 and 18.     Block 17. Price Group and 18. Estimated total price are located in the right margin of the CDLR. 21)  Page 90 of 101- States Volume II Management Factor consists of 3 Parts.  Only two parts Part A and Part B are listed. Please Clarify.    Page 90 of 101 shall be corrected to stated Volume II-Management Factor  Consists of 2 parts. 22)  Page 92 of 101 â€“ Does the government have a spreadsheet like this it is  could provide to all contractors, so that there are no formula or mathematical  errors that could adversely effect the award of the contract?     It is not necessary for the Government to supply this spreadsheet to all  contractors.  This is just a sample of how the weighted guidelines will be  computed.  When submitting a proposal one only need to provide a price for each  line item and quantity range.  The Governmentâ€™s Price analysis will perform the  weighted average analysis for total price. 23)  Page 98 of 101 â€“ Evaluation of offers TDP.  Please explain what there is a  separate TDP from the government supplied TDP?     One can submit a technical data package based on the performance  specifications.  It is not a requirement to follow the Governmentâ€™s TDP.  The Governmentâ€™s TDP is for informational purposes only.   24)  General â€“ Is there a page limitation?      There is no page limit. 25)  General â€“ Do each section of the proposal need to stand alone?  I.E. â€“ If  we discuss additional quality aspects outside of the quality section (Technical Factor, Part C) as they relate to another area will these comments be included  in the overall evaluation?  If not, MAST may have to be more repetitive to  ensure that each section has adequate content.        When submitting the proposal it is best to be as clear as possible.  Iâ€™d  suggest addressing each section as a stand alone.  If this is not practicable,  please reference the specific.   26)  General-This solicitation includes a performance specification and  drawings.  Does our submission have to meet the performance specification only  and are we free to use our design?  Alternatively, must we adhere to the  supplied drawings and the performance specification?       The item does need to meet the performance specification. You may use your own design, however, it still must meet the requirements in the performance spec.The technical data package (TDP) is for informational purposes only.  You can choose to design to the TDP, but it is not a requirement of this solicitation.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Plexus Institute, P.O. Box 395, 42 South Main Street, Allentown, New Jersey 08501, to provide education services for the 2-day kickoff meeting of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Prevention Initiative August 17-18, 2006, at Pittsburgh, PA. The Plexus Institute's Positive Deviance Initiative (PDI) at Tufts University was formed in 2001 under the direction of Jerry Sternin.  Positive Deviance (PD) is a development approach that is based on the premise that solutions to community problems already exist within the community.  Jerry Sternin, the major developer of PD, and Curt Lindberg, will provide these services.  The developers of PD are the only experts who can facilitate the educational initiatives needed for the behavior and cultural transformation.  Jerry Sternin has extensive experience working with PD around the world.  A pilot program using PD was implemented at the VAPHS Heinz Division.  Use of PD fostered a behavior and cultural change in a cohort of professionals that has successfully reduced MRSA infection.  It is anticipated that the success of this program can be expanded to other VA and community hospitals to reduce MRSA infection.   This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by a narrative describing their expert qualifications and capabilities to perform these services, to the Contracting Officer no later than August 10, 2006 C.O.B.  Responses should be sent to Linda.Glancy@med.va.gov or faxed to Linda Glancy at (412) 365-5471.  Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The California Institute of Technology’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seeks to identify potential sources interested in responding to a Request for Information (RFI) for Web Hosting Services in support of the Laboratory’s Computing & Networking Enterprise. BACKGROUND: The JPL Information Technology (IT) web service currently hosts approximately 750 web sites internally using their own servers, software and labor. Additionally, there are estimated to be approximately up to 1,000 additional web sites that are hosted internally by their respective sponsoring organizations. The number of content providers could come close to equaling the number of web sites. The JPL web hosting environment is heterogeneous.  Hardware includes Sun, HP, Dell, Mac and others with an equally diverse set of operating systems and versions. While Apache is the primary web server on the Lab, it is certainly not the only one. Web developer support software includes ColdFusion, MySQL, Perl, PhP, Python, Java and several others. The JPL web sites are heterogeneous in their accessibility, with some being publicly-accessible, some JPL-internal only, and some being password-protected. Protection is generally achieved via firewalls and authentication via a JPL LDAP directory. The JPL web access environment is heterogeneous. Browsers include, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape, Safari and Mozilla. Desktop platforms include Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Solaris. SCOPE: This RFI proposes to obtain releasable information from major web hosting providers regarding their direct experience with hosting modern enterprise-quality, efficient web sites for private companies and/or government. The consolidated information received will be considered in determining JPL’s approach to web hosting, including whether JPL could realize advantages in cost or service by purchasing web hosting services instead of self-providing. KEY REQUIREMENTS: We respectfully request a direct but concise response to the following key points regarding your company’s web hosting: (1) Migration; (2) Control Panel and Self-service; (3) Developer Support Software and Utilities; (4) Wikis and Blogs; (5) Bandwidth and Throughput; (6) Performance; (7) Management; (8) Monitoring; (9) Metrics; (10) Support; (11) Content Ownership and Intellectual Property; (12) Disengagement; and (13) Cost and Features of hosting plans offered. The Laboratory requests that interested parties respond to the thirteen (13) key requirements above in written form not to exceed three (3) pages in length. Please include: (a) your company name and contact information; (b) business status (i.e., large, small, woman-owned, etc.) and (c) any other information about your company and/or experience in this type of effort. WHO MAY PROPOSE? This opportunity is open to educational institutions; Nonprofit, nonacademic organizations (i.e., a private or government supported research lab, university consortium, etc.); IT Industry; Other government agencies (i.e., any non-NASA, U.S. federal executive agency, national laboratory or Federally Funded Research & Development Center (FFRDC). RESPONSES DUE: All responses to the RFI are due no later than August 16, 2006, to JPL, Attention: Business Opportunities Office, M/S 190-205, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109-8099 or via email to maryhelen.ruiz@jpl.nasa.gov TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT: All questions of a technical nature pertaining to this RFI shall be directed to Douglas Hughes at (818) 354-1186 or via email: douglas.s.hughes@jpl.nasa.gov DISCLAIMER: It is emphasized that the requested information is for preliminary planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that JPL will solicit you for such procurement in the future. Neither JPL nor the Government will be responsible for any costs incurred by you in furnishing this information. Prospective contractors are advised that any information provided shall be deemed to be furnished with unlimited rights to JPL, with JPL assuming no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.

<DESC>The 412 TW/AFFTC, Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing two courses in regards to “Theory of Constraints Training,” titled Deployment Expert and Technical Expert . 

REQUIREMENTS: 
Theory of Constraints – Deployment Expert
Course Number TOC-DE

Duration:  		10 days
Total Hours:  		80
Course Method:  	Classroom

Description:  TOC Project Management (TOCPM) consists of five key elements:  project planning, project scheduling, multi-project synchronization, resource behaviors, and project control and decision impact visibility.  These elements are implemented with the necessary logistical and cultural changes to improve reliability and reduce program lead times through more effective management of resources.  In order to be successful with TOC PM, organizations must develop the internal expertise that is required to support and sustain an implementation.  The first three levels of Internal Experts are:  Technical Expert (TE), Deployment Expert (DE), and Master of Organizational Alignment (MOA).  Deployment Expert training provides participants with the know-how for addressing implementation issues, customizing the generic solution, and for achieving buy-in within the organization.  DE training is designed to enable people to become leaders in addressing the cultural elements of the solution.  Participants in DE training learn more about the solution by constructing the cause-effect logic that demonstrates why the solution works so effectively.  This creates a much deeper level of understanding and provides a solid basis for customization, tailoring the generic solution to the specific need of their organization, and for dealing with the many potential obstacles to successful implementation.  Participants are also taught the rigorous TOC Buy-in process for securing the support and collaboration of people who will be critical to achieving overall success and are coached in the use of Avraham Y. Goldratt Institute training material that has been developed and tailored to address the unique needs of each key constituency (senior managers, functional/resource managers, and resources) within their organization.  This two-week program is for those who will fulfill the role of Deployment Experts and has a pre-requisite of Technical Expert Training.

The first three levels of Internal Experts are:  Technical Expert (TE), Deployment Expert (DE), and Master of Organizational Alignment (MOA).  Technical Expert Training is designed to provide participants with the technical know-how that is required to perform tasks in support of an implementation or ongoing use of TOC PM.  Participants learn how to build project networks, create Critical Chain schedules by hand, understand the logic of synchronization and how it affects individual Critical Chain schedules, identify synchronizers, identify project priority, manage by buffers, and create budgets for Critical Chain schedules.  Participants are introduced to key elements of the implementation process and the operational roles of people within the organization:  senior managers, project managers, resource managers, resources, and the various internal Experts.  This two-week program is designed for people who will fulfill the role of Technical Experts and is required as a pre-requisite for Deployment Experts training.

Description
Air Refueling Pods and Pylons.  This sources sought synopsis is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for production of ten (10) MC-130H air refueling pods. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined. Contractors/ Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this sources sought synopsis. INSTRUCTIONS: Below is a description of the refueling pods’ capability requirement, which allows you to provide your company’s capability. The government anticipates purchasing 10 electronically controlled pods.  52 pods have been previously purchased from Flight Refuelling Limited (FRL), Wimborne, United Kingdom.  The delivery is Feb 2008.  Anticipate this will be a commercial acquisition.  Re-procurement data is not available.  There is no development funding available.  Based on current knowledge the government believes that FRL is the only source capable of providing the required capability.  Interested parties shall provide pods that posses the following capabilities.  The pod must, as an absolute minimum, provide the following capabilities: (1) Be capable of refueling all current and planned Special Operations Forces (SOF) vertical lift aircraft, including all current SOF helicopters and tilt rotor aircraft, such as the CV-22. (2) It must be able to transfer all aviation fuels used by the MC-130H, adapting to different aviation jet fuel types useable by the MC-130H while still accurately computing transfer rates and fuel off-loads. (3) It must be able to accomplish in-flight refueling of receiver aircraft through a speed range of 95 knots equivalent airspeed (KEAS) to 180 KEAS without requiring the aircraft to land reconfigure or replace the drogue.  (4) It must be able to simultaneously transfer 150 gallons per minute to each of two SOF receiver proof pressures, without extensive modification to the current MC-130H fuel transfer system, or use of a cargo compartment tank pump system. (5) The pod lighting systems(s) must support both day and night operations.  Night operations will be conducted with either natural visions or with the aid of night vision devices.  Therefore, lighting must be compatible with current night vision goggle (NVG) technology.  (6) Finally, the pod must not prevent the MC-130H from performing all current operations, to include terrain following flight, airdrop, NVG landings, and in-flight refueling from KC-135 of KC-10 aircraft with the ARS installed.   If, after reviewing this information, you desire to participate in responding to this sources sought, you should provide documentation that supports your company’s capabilities in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.).  Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this sources sought research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.

The purpose of this sources sought notice is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g. 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) that may be qualified to provide specified fee-for service health insurance benefit administration services including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare program (also known as the Medicare fee-for services, or FSS program in accordance with the attached “Draft” Statement of Work (S.O.W.) entitled, “Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractor Statement of Work.”  

As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS will replace its current claims payment contractors – fiscal intermediaries and carriers – with new contract entities called Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs).  As a result of MMA, CMS designed new MAC jurisdictions to balance the allocation of workloads, promote competition, account for integration of claims processing activities, and mitigate the risk to the Medicare program during the transition to the new contractors.  This sources sought notice is targeted for jurisdiction 4 (includes the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas), jurisdiction 5 (includes the states of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska), and jurisdiction 12 (includes the states of Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania).  Additional Medicare Contract Reform information can be located on the CMS Medicare Contract Reform website: 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicareContractingReform/ .  
 
Interested parties having the corporate capability and expertise necessary to perform the stated requirements outlined in the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) may submit capability statements via email to Darrell.Bachman@cms.hhs.gov and Linda.Hook@cms.hhs.gov.  Capability statements must demonstrate experience and expertise pertaining to the requirements stated in the SOW and shall be limited to 20 pages.  Responses should also include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, facsimile number, email address, and business size and status (e.g. small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 524114: Direct Health and Medical Insurance Carriers.

Responses must be submitted not later than August 16, 2006 by 5:00pm EDT.  Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date.  All communications shall be by email.  Only responses from small businesses (e.g. 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) will be considered.  This is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  No reimbursement will be made for costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and follow-up information requests.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review of the capability statements. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether small business firms possess the capability to fulfill the Governments requirement.

<DESC>Background:  Funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has been conducting research, development and demonstration (RD&D) projects to facilitate the deployment of alternative fuels into the marketplace in order to achieve three objectives: 1) enhance the reduction of mobile source emissions in California and the United States; 2) increase US competitiveness and economic prosperity; and 3) preserve the environment through the reduction of emissions and toxins from the motor vehicle population. NREL and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) are collaborating on a joint RD&D project to demonstrate the benefits of the unique properties of Fischer-Tropsch diesel fuel and to substantially reduce the emissions from engines used in on-road transportation refrigeration applications. This project supports SCAQMD’s mandate under the Lewis-Presley Air Quality Management Act to establish a program to encourage participation in projects to increase the utilization of clean-burning fuels.

Additionally, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) recently passed legislation regulating the particulate matter (PM) emissions from transport refrigeration units (TRUs). The PM emission contribution from TRUs is estimated at 2.6% of the total diesel PM emission. Emissions from TRUs are expected to increase in future years. To address these emissions, the CARB is requiring TRUs to meet specific performance standards based on unit horsepower. A TRU can meet the regulation with a variety of techniques including engine exhaust aftertreatment and/or fuel substitution. 

Accordingly, NREL, SCAQMD, and CARB are exploring strategies to mitigate PM emissions from TRUs. One strategy is to employ gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel in place of conventional diesel fuel. In on-road engines, GTL fuel has been shown to reduce PM emissions without accompanying increases in other regulated emissions (Alleman and McCormick, SAE 2003-01-0763). The near-zero sulfur content of GTL fuel can also enable exhaust aftertreatment and may allow this equipment to operate at higher efficiencies. 

Project Description and Fuel Requirement:  NREL is leading a project to evaluate, quantify, and compare emissions from TRU diesel engines fueled with: (1) GTL fuel and equipped with a particulate filter, and (2) CARB specification diesel fuel.  NREL intends to select up to twelve TRU-equipped vehicles from a host fleet in the South Coast Air Basin for evaluation. Six of the TRUs will be powered by GTL-fueled engines and retrofitted with particulate filters.  The remaining six TRUs will be operated exclusively with CARB specification conventional diesel serving as control groups.  The catalyst system will then be installed at the exhaust of six TRU engines. One of the TRU engines will be tested over steady-state test procedures on an engine dynamometer while the engine is independently powered by GTL fuel, with and without the DPF and CARB diesel fuel.  The TRU-equipped vehicles will then be demonstrated in service for six to twelve months to evaluate performance, reliability, and emission-reduction potential of GTL fuel and a particulate filter system. The same TRU engine will be tested again at the end of the project.

Fuel Provider Requirements: To support the fuel requirements of the above-described project, NREL is seeking organizations that can supply GTL diesel fuel and technical liaison services under the conditions described below.  Organizations responding to this Notice will demonstrate their ability to meet these requirements:

1.	The fuel supplier shall have a paraffinic GTL or Fischer-Tropsch diesel fuel in a single lot, sufficient to supply the TRU fleet for the entire project. The fuel shall be available immediately and for the project duration of 18 months, in an estimated monthly volume of 50 drums.

<SUBJECT>91 -- Controllable Magneto-Rheological Fluid-Based Dampers for Drilling
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is soliciting expressions of interest from potential partners to further develop and/or commercialize the technologies discussed below. Partnerships are anticipated to take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/or commercial licenses. CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Labs and licensed rights may be up to exclusive in a field-of-use, depending on the business case. Sandia is seeking partners that have proven experience in translating technologies into market-driven products, have technical capabilities in the technical area(s) discussed below, are fiscally sound and well managed, and can commit to manufacturing the products in the U.S.

A concept has been developed for reducing vibration in drillstrings while drilling in oil, gas, and geothermal reservoirs.  The technology development uses Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids, a suspension of micron–size iron particles within a carrier fluid such as water, oil, or silicone.  These iron particles respond to a magnetic field by aligning themselves along magnetic flux lines.  The stress necessary to displace the MR fluid is a function of the magnetic field strength in the fluid.  The controllable MR fluid-based damping system is coupled with an appropriate spring stiffness within a drilling sub and inserted into the drillstring near the bit at the base of the drillstring.  The system is autonomously powered and controlled by on-board electronics resident within the housing of the drilling sub.

Vibration in the bit of a drillstring produces a wavy surface in the rock that feeds back into the interaction between the bit and drillstring.  This system allows the reduction in vibrations in the drillstring through real–time control.  Vibrations are controlled by altering the damping forces through variation in a control voltage to the coil that generates the magnetic field.  Controlling the level of vibration reduces bit and drillstring and tool joint failures, increases drilling production rates, and reduces drilling costs.

Existing systems incorporating dampers are passive and configured before the bit enters the hole.  Accordingly, they are unable to respond to variability in drilling conditions.  Prototype controllable dampers have been developed at Sandia using MR fluid technology and tested in the laboratory.  They have shown that stable drilling conditions can be maintained when changes in the drilling lithology introduce vibrations into the drillstring.  Intellectual property (US Patent No. 7,036,612 B1) pertaining to the application of MR fluid technologies to the problem of drillstring vibrations has been granted to Sandia Corporation.

Interested parties may respond by contacting Teresa Montoya, Sandia Administration, Fax 505-844-8011; e-mail: tmontoy@sandia.gov.  Please include a brief description of your proposed type of partnership (CRADA or license) and any details you can provide as to specific requirements.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice of Intent to Negotiate and Award a Sole Source Contract
<DESC>This requirement was previously posted on 6/29/2006 and identified with reference number NOI-PMK-06292006. The U.S. Census Bureau has a requirement for expert advice and assistance in planning, implementing, and operating information technology (IT) programs and facility projects in support of the mission of the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau is the premier source of information about the American people and the economy. More than just numbers, this information shapes important policy decisions that help improve the nation’s social and economic conditions. The Census Bureau’s mission is built around large-scale surveys and censuses. Activities involve survey and questionnaire design, geographic infrastructure update, and data collection, processing, and dissemination. Research and data analysis help improve processes from data collection through dissemination. Within the Census Bureau is the Computer Services Division (CSvD), the mission of which is to provide the Census Bureau and other customers with a world-class computer center using best practices and state-of-the-art technology to monitor systems, communications and applications. In addition, CSvD ensures the deliverance of expert systems administration services and the functionality of a stable, fault tolerant, and secure computing facility. CSvD has the primary responsibility for planning, implementing, and operating information technology (IT) programs and facility projects, and requires high level IT strategic and operational expertise beyond its inherent resources in order to effectively support the mission of the Census Bureau. These services include the following: (a) recommending and facilitating implementation of new initiatives to determine the impact on facilities management and disaster recovery activities; reviewing and evaluating administrative and technical IT operations, (c) designing and preparing materials and presentations for executive and client briefings and forums; (d) providing on-going expert consultation concerning the mission, direction and operations of the Computer Services Division (CSVD) and the Census Bureau Bowie Computer Center (BCC), (e) coordinating and managing the BCC major electrical and mechanical infrastructure upgrades with GSA and Census operations staff, and (f) making recommendations for such areas as streamlining efforts, problem solutions, and business practice reengineering and improvements. The effectiveness of these services is highly dependent on the ability to project a thorough understanding and intimate knowledge of Census Bureau mission, programs, policies, priorities, strategic plans, and operations as well as the ability to develop and maintain effective relationships with executives and managers throughout the Census Bureau community in order to garner acceptance of viewpoints, influence decision-making, and garner support and cooperation for implementing recommendations and carrying out projects. It is critically important to maintain continuity of ongoing initiatives, projects and other efforts, many of which are time-critical, in order to avert interruptions, delays, duplicative work, relearning, and excessive costs. Although IT technical support can be met by small business concerns, what makes this requirement unique is the necessity to integrate knowledge of BCC-specific IT strategic requirements. The electrical and mechanical environment at BCC is not sufficiently documented to enable a source unfamiliar to the BCC environment to function effectively in providing the required services.  Significant BCC resources would have to be diverted from ongoing critical operations and projects in order to develop and make available the documentation to potential offerors so that they may gain necessary background information to be able to submit a proposal and perform effectively after award.  Without this knowledge and information, any contractor who is unfamiliar with ongoing BCC operations and projects would likely jeopardize these activities.  While it is in the best interest of the Census Bureau to fill in gaps in documentation and remove barriers to competition in future procurements for similar requirements, the most reasonable strategy for doing so is to methodically transfer such knowledge over time. The proposed contractor is the incumbent, Mr. James E. Steed of Falling Waters, WV. For the past five years, Mr. Steed has demonstrated the ability to satisfy the Government’s requirements as described above. Given the vital nature of the work and available information, Mr. Steed is considered the only source that can meet the Government’s requirement satisfactorily. Mr. Steed, who is a Certified Business Continuity Professional (CBCP), is actively involved in CSVD’s disaster recovery functions for the BCC and provides facility support for the BCC Continuity of Operations (COOP) effort. Mr. Steed’s specific expertise and knowledge of the BCC’s electrical and mechanical infrastructure design and operation; knowledge of the BCC data center operational requirements; knowledge of the program area requirements, and his disaster recovery/contingency certification support this request. Mr. Steed has a thorough understanding of both the data center requirements and the facility management requirements at the BCC. The Government believes that CBCP certification and specific experience with BCC COOP planning is essential to its requirement in order to obtain well-informed viewpoints, advice, and recommendations that are likely to be viewed as credible and worthy of consideration in decision-making. The Government's requirement entails building upon and bringing to fruition ongoing, time-sensitive work and activity that is critical to achieving BCC's strategic objectives. Mr. Steed was instrumental in conceptualizing, developing, and performing much of this work. The Government believes that the success of this work is dependent on Mr. Steed's continued involvement because any other source would necessitate extensive relearning, duplication of effort, unacceptable delays, and excessive costs, and would jeopardize BCC's ability to meet its strategic goals. It is the Government’s intention to solicit and negotiate a contract for the requirement with Mr. Steed on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302. The intended contract will have a period of performance of one year and will include four one-year option periods. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven (7) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>--CORRECTION TO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT  Joint Integrated Air & Missile Defense Industry Day, August 17-18, 2006
<DESC>On behalf of the Department of Defense (DOD), the Force Protection Functional Capabilities Board (FP FCB) announces a Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense (JIAMD) Industry Day for the purpose of identifying potential materiel approaches to mitiga ting present and foreseen Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability gaps. The JIAMD Industry Day is classified SECRET and will be held at the Lockheed Martin Corporation Auditorium, 4800 Bradford Drive, Huntsville, AL, on August 17 from 1300 to 1730, and on August 18 from 0800 to 1200. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council has approved the IAMD Joint Capabilities Document and directed three Functional Solutions Analyses (FSAs), as follows:	FSA 1:  Detection, Tracking, and Determination of Inte nt of Asymmetric (Irregular) Air and Cruise Missile Threats to the Homeland. FSA 2:  Detection, Tracking, Engagement and Kill Assessment of Ballistic Missile Threats, to Include Those Equipped with Weapons of Mass Destruction. FSA 3:  Active Air Defense Against Air and Cruise Missile Threats. Lead DOD Sponsor for FSA 1 is the USAF; lead for FSA 2 is the Navy and lead for FSA 3 is the Army.  FSA 1 will also address capability gaps identified in the Homeland Air and Cruise Missile Defense of North America Joint Capabilities Document.  In response to recommendations made in the Quadrennial Defense Review, the Defense Acquisition Executive, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Program Analysis and Evaluation are initiating the Concept Decision Experiment.  Th is experiment will explore revisions to streamline the DOD acquisition process in part, by conducting a Concept Decision Review early in the process to consider requirements, acquisition, and programming for the identified joint warfighter capability gaps.   This early decision point is expected to result in fewer program starts but greater stability for the programs that are started.  Since IAMD has been selected as a pilot program for the Concept Decision Experiment, the planned FSAs will be merged with ot her analytical activities to produce an Evaluation of Alternatives (EoA).  The JIAMD Industry Day is expected to support the emerging IAMD EoA.  In advance of the JIAMD Industry Day events, it is anticipated that there will be two separate Requests for Inf ormation (RFI) released during the week of 1 August 2006.  RFIs will be issued to request ideas for materiel or non-materiel solutions for the capability gaps assigned to FSAs 1 and 3.  There will not be an RFI for the capability gaps assigned to FSA 2. Du ring the August 17 session, the Lead DOD Sponsors will present their respective Study Plans, to include discussion of the classified capability gaps assigned to their respective FSAs.  Each briefing will be followed by a discussion and question & answer pe riod, to ensure respondents understand the intent of the RFI.  Written questions may be submitted via a template to be provided at the Industry Day.  On August 18, time will be provided for additional discussions and question & answer periods.    EoA Task Force Leads are:  Joint Staff: Lt Col Robert O. Watt, 703-602-5395; OSD AT&L Mr. Mike Novak, 703-697-6445; and OSD PA&E Mr. Dave Hall, 703-695-0907, FSA 1 USAF POC is Major Michael Reschke, 703-601-0155, FSA 2 USN POC is Dr. Gregory Swider, 703-82 4-2574 (FSA 2 not included in JIAMD Industry Day), FSA 3 & HACMD USA POC is LTC Christopher M.

PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.         This solicitation is being issued as a small business set-aside under Request for Quotation No. 2006-Q-08926.       The NAICS is 213111 with a size standard of 500 employees..     This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11.     The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is conducting ongoing field and laboratory investigations that are focused on remote application of extinguishing agents, deployment strategies for firefighting equipment, and permanent and temporary fire containment sealing technology. The goals of this research are to evaluate new and existing technologies and to limit miner exposure by developing or improving suppression strategies to help ensure the best possible outcome during a mine fire. The bulk of the work is being conducted at the NIOSH Lake Lynn Laboratory (LLL) located off Pennsylvania State Route 857, southwest of Fairchance, Fayette County, PA (about 60 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and 10 miles northeast of Morgantown, WV). LLL is a highly sophisticated underground and surface laboratory located where large-scale explosion trials, mine fire research and a myriad of other mine safety and health research programs are conducted. The underground workings, known as the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM), are sized to match those of commercial mines, thus making them true, full-scale test galleries. 
The proposed work will be completed over a 3 (three) month time period at the LLEM. This work involves the drilling and completion from 2 (two) to 4 (four) boreholes to the underground mine workings below. NIOSH will survey the surface and underground locations. It is estimated that the depth to the mine void for each borehole will be no more than 350 ft. The exact number of boreholes to be drilled, actual depths and all surface and underground survey data will be provided to the Contractor before the commencement of drilling operations. The Contractor shall drill a sufficiently sized borehole and set surface conductor casing and cement to the surface as needed. The Contractor will then drill a 10¨ö to 10¨ú in diameter borehole to within 1 ft of the mine void. The mine void penetration point is of critical importance and it is therefore essential that the borehole penetrate the mine void to within 3 ft of the surveyed horizontal mine level location. The Contractor is required to utilize downhole directional drilling techniques and the appropriate downhole surveying technology to guide the borehole to the desired underground location. If the borehole wanders excessively (beyond the variance outlined above) and penetrates the mine void at the wrong location, NIOSH may require the borehole to be re-drilled at no additional cost. The Contractor will set 8¨ý in diameter J-55 (or K-55) seamless well casing to the total depth of the borehole. The casing will be equipped with sufficient centralizers, baskets and/or cement shoe to ensure a successful cementing operation. The Contractor will then cement each borehole to the surface with API Class-A type cement. Once the cement has set, the Contractor will drill the remaining distance to the mine void. When the borehole drilling operations have been completed, the Contractor will provide and install a wellhead that is capable of holding 2¨þ in diameter tubing. The wellhead will have two ports that will be closed with high pressure bull plugs. Once the drilling work has been completed, the Contractor will generate a final report that will summarize the work conducted at each drill site.   The complete Statement of Work is contained in the attached solicitation package uploaded to this website.  

Availability of funding will determine how many boreholes can be drilled, therefore, pricing shall be provided as follows:  Line Items costs shall include breakout of surveying, casing, cementing, wellhead, etc..     CLIN 0001  Drilling of Borehole C1 IAW SOW;    CLIN 0002  Drilling of Borehole C2 IAW SOW;    CLIN 0003  Drilling of Borehole A1 IAW SOW;   CLIN 0004  Drilling of Borehole A2 IAW SOW;    CLIN 0005  Mobilization/demobilization and downhole surveying costs per site; CLIN 0006 Summary Report Generation  and   CLIN 0007 Reclamation Costs    Period of Performance is 3 months after receipt of notice to proceed.       EVALUATION: Quotes will be evaluated in accordance with applicable acquisition policies and procedures.   The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror  whose quote conforming to this solicitation is considered most advantageous to the Government, price and delivery considered.     Failure to provide sufficient information to demonstrate compliance with all requirements included herein may result in rejection of your offer.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ), solicitation number FA7000-06-T-0112, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.     

The USAFA/DFAN has a requirement to repair or replace one 14-inch Hammel-Dahl globe valve which is part of the compressor system used for the Trisonic Wind Tunnel located in Building 2410, Aeronautics Laboratory, United States Air Force Academy. 

The subject valve is part of the permanently installed support equipment for the Aeronautics Laboratory's Trisonic Wind Tunnel. Air, which is compressed and stored at 600 psig and 120 degrees Fahrenheit, is vented at volume flow rates as high as 52 cubic feet per second through the 14-inch globe valve and into the wind tunnel. The valve is over 40 years old and was last overhauled in 1985. It now leaks and needs to be restored or replaced to ensure a leak proof seal.

1.0	Background 

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates a fleet of twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are operated differently from general aviation; Coast Guard HU-25 missions frequently operate at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments.  This environment accelerates corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft.  The Coast Guard typically flies each of these aircraft 800 flight hours per year.  Aircraft are inspected in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacture’s (OEM) periodic requirements in conjunction with the Coast Guard’s specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  Historically, corrosion damage and operational wear and tear associated with aging aircraft is revealed, which is often outside the scope of OEM published repair limits and specifications.  All Coast Guard horizontal stabilizers are serial number tracked under ACMS.  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, item location and status.  It also provides an effective method of configuration control.  
2.0	Objective		
The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center or equivalent, to effectively repair HU-25 horizontal stabilizers, Part Numbers MY20331-16 and MY20331-17.  Repaired horizontal stabilizers must meet the OEM current specifications, critical profile and dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  The Coast Guard requires a Turn-Around-Time of 120 days from time of material receipt at prospective contractor facility in order to prevent Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) delay in aircraft delivery.  During repair, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated.  The horizontal stabilizer must also be painted to match the Coast Guard’s current colors and paint schemes. 
The Coast Guard anticipates at least two levels of repair for horizontal stabilizers.  First, a “return-to-service repair” would be required for horizontals that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or minor impact damage, inspection and replacement of bushings and hardware as required. This would require skin repair and hardware.  Second, “extensive repair” would be required for horizontal stablizers that require replacement of skins, major extrusions, and fittings. At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the prospective contractor technical and price proposal.  Prospective contractor may propose additional levels of service.
3.0	   Applicable Documents 
The following Technical Specifications are applicable:
		A. OEM drawings: 
	1.	MY20331-16/17 drawings
	2.	Falcon 20 Maintenance Manual, Chapter 55

3.	USCG ARSC Paint Drawing 925-139, HU-25A Paint and Detail Markings, Ref. F, dated 02/03/06
4.0 	  Requirements

	A.  The prospective contractor is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to, original manufacturer’s drawings and specifications, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, serviceable and non-serviceable parts bonded storage, preservation, packaging, and shipping. 
	
B.  The Coast Guard maintains all aircraft and resources in an Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  The ACMS system tracks and schedules maintenance of aircraft components and assemblies by serial number and part number. The prospective contractor's responsibilities within ACMS consist of completion and submission of the included Component Repair Record (CRR) as follows:

1. A current copy of the ACMS Configuration Report and a Significant Component History Report (SCHR) will be provided with each horizontal stabilizer. The prospective contractor shall ensure these reports correspond with the current configuration of the component. All discrepancies shall be reported to the Contracting Officer.

2. Upon completion of repair of the tracked component, the prospective contractor shall complete the Component Repair Record provided and include Service Bulletins Complied with and other maintenance performed. 

	a. One copy of the CRR with the original SCHR should be sent with each horizontal stabilizer, a copy with the invoice and one copy mailed to:  

				Commanding Officer
				USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center
				ATTN: AVENG/ACMS
				Elizabeth City, NC 27909

These forms are considered deliverables under the contract.	Noncompliance with these instructions shall result in nonpayment of invoices. The contractor shall maintain a copy of each completed CRR for a minimum of ninety (90) days.
 	C.  Under a performance-based requirements contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract. The performance measures and metrics will be reviewed for the extent they are comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives, identify the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness, and will be tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics. The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the contractor will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.
D. Technical	
1.  Provide detailed work specifications for horizontal stabilizer “return-to-service repair”, “extensive repair” and any other proposed levels of repair.  
2. Horizontal stabilizers shall be painted using products that meet or exceed MIL-PRF-23377 epoxy primer and MIL-PRF-85285 polyurethane topcoats.  Aviation coatings which meet or exceed the performance and quality of these products may be substituted.
3. Horizontal stabilizers shall be painted to match the Coast Guard paint schemes, IAW ARSC Paint Drawing 925-139.
 NOTE: Color match is critical for this contract and future aircraft maintenance.  Coatings currently used by the Coast Guard are known to provide satisfactory results on aircraft operating in corrosive environments when properly applied.  
4. All products proposed for use shall be submitted with quote for performance and color match review and approval. 
5. ARSC currently applies AKZO Nobel Eclipse products to the HU-25 stabilizers. 
          The following AKZO part numbers are provided only as references for the required color match standards.  
a. Gray AKZO P/N: 666-58-6320
b. White AKZO P/N: ECL-G-46
c. Orange AKZO P/N: ECL-G-3655
E. Service Bulletins

Service bulletins are subject to change during the contract period of performance.

All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins.   Upon receipt of components requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the offeror shall prepare a firm fixed price proposal IAW instructions listed below.  Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supersede the previous configuration.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the contract.  The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superseded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.
Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.  The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups.  The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Offeror incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated.  Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract.  The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

Description
DESCRIPTION:    There is no solicitation to download. Architect/Engineer (A/E) services are required for a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Mine Reclamation Services. The work for this contract shall occur at abandoned mine sites throughout Oregon and Washington. 

I.	INTRODUCTION

Abandoned mine sites are not typical HAZMAT environments. Mine sites are located in remote areas often without radio or cell phone coverage and in extremely steep terrain. Project accomplishment is complicated by the access to mine sites, which is generally difficult since most sites are remote and at high elevations. Wildfires can be very dangerous to crews at these sites since there is usually only one way out and communication is limited. Snow conditions often hide mine features such as vertical shafts and make the area slippery and dangerous. 

At many sites, the contractor must enter underground workings to determine flow characteristics of acid mine drainage. Health and safety of the contractor’s employees and government oversight is paramount to successful completion of the project. Qualified contractors must have experience with mining processes involving the extraction of metals from ore bodies and understand the relationship of mine waste and contamination. The on-the-ground activities at abandoned mine sites, include all the following phases:
•	Removal Site Evaluation
•	Removal Action
•	Post-Removal Monitoring

Abandoned mine removal actions are generally addressed through the National Contingency Plan, 40 CFR 300.

II.	GENERAL CONTRACT DISCRIPTION

Contractor(s) shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, interstate, and local laws, environmental regulations, and requirements. All work submitted and performed by the contractor may be subject to review and approval of EPA and/or the appropriate state regulatory agency. The contractor is required to maintain and submit evidence of liability, property damage and other insurance at or above minimum limits established by law, and in accordance with industry standards, for the types of work being conducted.

     The following specifications outline what is general to all projects in each of the activity areas. It is not the intent of the government to give detailed instructions but a general overview as to what is required as every project site varies and regulations and/or requirements vary between Oregon and Washington. A master contract with specifications and clauses common to all task orders will be provided to contractors selected by the evaluation board for award. Detailed instructions shall be provided when the individual site specific task orders are issued.

When a new mine site is considered for evaluation purposes a Evaluation Board shall consider the A/E firms on this IDIQ contract. The members of this board shall be appointed from among highly qualified professional employees’ famialiar with the mine clean-up process. This board will prepare a selection report for the Contracting Officer or other designated selection authority recommending, in order of preference, the firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to perform the required services. Once the board has selected a A/E firm no additional competition shall be required to move to the next task within the evaluated mine site, however the government reserves the right to reevaluate the other A/E firms when the government feels it is in it’s best interest to do so. Factors that may influence reconsideration may include, past performance, workload balancing, or price.  All tasks in Activity I and Activity III shall be considered included in the Board’s selection report.

III  Activities and Tasks 

A.	Activity I – Site Assessment/Characterization

1.	Task 1 – Abbreviated Preliminary Assessment (APA)

2.	Task 2 – Site Inspections (SI)

3.   Task 3 – Watershed Analysis

4.	Task 4 – Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA)

5.	Task 5 – Streamlined Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessment and Evaluation

B.	Activity II – Enforcement Support

1.	Task 1 – Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) Search

i.	Requirements

&#61485;	Only highly skilled firms specializing in this type of activity will be considered for this work.
&#61485;	The Contractor shall keep the FS informed of its findings throughout the course of the PRP investigation as the FS may specify additional depth and direction of the research as information becomes available.
&#61485;	The FS will give direction as to which PRP will require additional in-depth research.
&#61485;	The Contractor can expect OGC to review and comment on draft documents.
&#61485;	The Contractor can expect to have direct communication with OGC as required.

ii.	Work under this task include, but are not limited to:

&#61485;	Agency Record Collection and File Review
&#61485;	Conduct Interviews
&#61485;	Perform Title Search
&#61485;	Conduct Financial Research
&#61485;	PRP Status/PRP History
&#61485;	PRP Name and Address Updates
&#61485;	History of Operations at the Site
&#61485;	Compile Waste-In Information
&#61485;	Records Compilation

C.	Activity III – Removal Action/Implementation Support

       Task 1 – Community Relations Plan (CRP)

This task includes work efforts related to the preparation and/or implementation of the CRP for a site. When attending public meetings, open houses, community interviews, all contractor employees must identify themselves as employees of a FS contractor.

Task 2 – Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA)


Task 3 – Removal Design/Removal Action (RD/RA)

The removal design provided under this activity is the contractor’s best estimate and is expected to be revised as actual field conditions dictate. Actual field conditions may require frequent adjustments to the removal design and will require the contractor to exercise professional judgment during field implementation of the removal. A detailed design with drawings and specifications is not feasible or practical for abandoned mine sites. The On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) will base removal of the contamination on field design parameters that change frequently and require immediate action. Removal actions must be timely and responsive to the conditions uncovered at the site. 
 
Sub-Task 1 – Conduct Project Planning, Management, and Coordination with the FS 
A short narrative will be provided describing the work completed and any changes in conditions, data gaps encountered and proposed means of correcting that may affect the Contract schedule or costs.

Sub-Task 2 – Removal Design

Sub-Task 3 – Removal Action

Note: It is understood that the exact cost for the removal activities are not fully developed at this time. However, the contractor should make an engineer’s estimate as to the removal cost for this proposal. It is conceivable the actual removal costs may vary from the initial estimate. It should also be pointed out the selection of the preferred contractor for this work will be based on the experience of the personnel assigned to this project as to design and removal experience and thoroughness in the preparation of the proposal as to addressing the specific tasks of this contract and past experience in developing removal action costs at this stage.
   
The maximum contract value may not exceed $5,000,000 aggregate total.     The minimum guarantee for the contract shall be $5,000. The value of the individual task orders executed under this contract may range from $5,000 to $1,500,000.     Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates.     Contract term is for three years, or until the maximum dollar limit is reached, whichever occurs first.  Estimated start date for this contract is January 2007.  Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 (Brooks Act) selection procedures apply. This procurement is full and open competition no set-aside. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 and the annual small business size standard is $4.5 Million.           

The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.

After removal of the vehicle, and properly securing the vehicle in a storage facility, the contractor shall send all written notices to the registered owner, by certified mail as required by law.  
Upon mailing, or otherwise delivering the notice to the registered owner the Contractor may invoice for the towing services.  The contractor’s invoice must include a copy of the certified letter sent to the owner of record.  The Government will not pay for trips made if no vehicle is removed in accordance with this Statement of Work.

The Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm fixed-price, performance-based, commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ) RFQ-COM-06-13. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11.

PRICE SCHEDULE
CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBER (CLIN) ONE:  DIGITAL ULTRASOUND:  BASE PERIOD:  2,000 studies @ $_____ per study = $_____; OPTION ONE:   2,000 studies @ $_____ per study = $_____; OPTION TWO:  2,000 studies @ $_____ per study = $_____.

BACKGROUND: The Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service (AAIHS) is establishing a mobile women’s health clinic with broadband telemedicine capabilities to provide quality health care to Native American women in eight underserved communities in the area. The Mobile Digital Telemammography (MDT) Project Aberdeen Area has been designed to offer mammography and breast ultrasound examinations, cervical cancer screenings, and other health assessments and education services to Native American women.  

The broadband satellite telecommunications capability on the mobile unit will transmit digital images to a contracted reading center for immediate interpretation. The use of digital imaging in combination with broadband satellite communications will allow radiologists to read mammograms while the patients are still at the clinic. With this broadband link, the mobile clinic can go anywhere that is convenient for the patients in the widespread rural areas of North and South Dakota, and Nebraska. A distant radiology department equipped with digital mammography reading equipment will interpret images and transmit reports back to the mobile clinic while the patient is still there. This innovative approach is intended to reduce the patient anxiety that comes while waiting for the results of a mammogram.  Such anxiety sometimes causes patients to defer screenings until serious problems occur.  

Digital mammography offers numerous technical advantages over screen-film, including faster image acquisition, image enhancement capability, and better storage and transmission for archiving and consultation. But its full potential can be met only through soft-copy display and interpretation.  Success is highly dependent on a range of factors that include workstation design, efficient use of personnel, data management between digital acquisition and display systems, and determining the best way to review film priors alongside soft-copy images.

The purpose of this contract is for the provision of immediate interpretation services of digital, telemammography images. Workflow on the mobile unit has been planned to provide care to 15 - 20 patients per day. A mammography examination will be followed by the other women’s health services, keeping patients productively occupied while the images are transmitted and interpreted by remote radiologists.

PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS: The Contractor’s attending radiology physicians shall be: A. Board certified by the American College of Radiology (ACR); B. State-licensed to practice radiology, without restrictions, within the state where the contractor is located; and C. Credentialed and privileged by a JCAHO-accredited institution to perform radiology study interpretations via teleradiology.

Contractor’s attending physicians will also meet the “Qualifications and Responsibilities of Personnel” in the America College of Radiology Technical Specification for Teleradiology Section III, A, Physician.

INTERPRETATION REQUIREMENTS: A.  Report turnaround time shall be as specified in section C-5 following receipt of electronic images Tuesday through Thursday during mobile unit hours of operation, 7:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. (Central-Standard Time). B. The Contractor shall provide immediate telephone consultation with ordering clinicians to report abnormal findings for any radiology study that could alter the treatment and care of the patient.

COMMUNICATION NETWORK INTERFACE/REQUIREMENTS: To be compatible with equipment on board the mobile unit, the Contractor shall:  A. Use a teleradiology system/PACS or Reading Work Station that is DICOM 3.0 part 10 compliant and is current with ACR/NEMA Image Data Format. B. Provide equipment quality control policies and certifications to the contact person identified by the Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service. C. Establish local network firewalls and procedures to ensure patient confidentiality and security are consistent with HIPAA regulations and ACR guidelines. D. Provide a Reading Work Station that: 1. Has FDA approval to read mammography images acquired from a GE Senographe 2000D. 2. Is capable of displaying the DICOM standard Sigmoind LUT (Not Linear LUT). 3. Is capable of applying the “Premium View” image processing algorithm. 4. Has the ability to display mammography images acquired from a GE Senographe 2000D in the appropriate hanging protocols. 5. Has FDA approval and the ability to display the RTSS CAD markers for R2 and iCAD.

The Aberdeen Area utilizes a GE Senographe 2000D digital mammography acquisition system for current mammography images and will utilize a mammography film digitizer to provide prior patient mammography images, when available. The recommended systems are the: GE RWS or GE Seno Advantage workstations.

VOLUME OF MEDICAL IMAGING EXAMINATION PER YEAR BY CATEGORY AND REPORTING TIMEFRAMES: The following totals are estimated for mammograms. Multiple films for standard radiographic exam procedures will be forwarded to the Contractor for interpretation. A. Digital Mammography = 2,500/year; Real-time interpretation available Monday to Friday, 7:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M (Central Standard Time). Interpretation of screening digital mammography should be within 60 minutes from study receipt. Interpretation of diagnostic digital mammography studies should be within 30 minutes from study receipt. The estimated minimum of 1,300 mammograms per year. B. Routine breast ultrasounds = 500/year; Interpretation to be returned to mobile unit by noon the following business day. Ultrasounds are planned for FY2007 but may not be implemented until late in the Fiscal Year.

DISCUSSION OF PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES: Radiologist reading requirements contained in this Performance Work Statement are considered performance based, focusing on the Aberdeen Area’s desired results and outcomes. The Contractor shall be responsible for determining the most effective means by which these requirements will be fulfilled.

GITM would also like the vendor to provide an estimated time of response and plan for escalation to the next level. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Cisco switches. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government¿s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Cisco Switches and Components have been identified as a key component of the Department of State infrastructure. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cisco equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State¿s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor¿s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department¿s requirements as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. The Cisco switches (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for GITM deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the APC Smart-UPS (part number and descriptions listed in paragraph 2). The use of an APC Smart-UPS is essential to the Government's requirement for server and network infrastructure power protection thereby precluding consideration of the products of another brand at this time. The APC Smart-UPS has been identified as a key component of the Department¿s server and network infrastructure power protection system. APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. To ensure compatibility with existing hardware and software in the field, the uninterrupted power supply must be an APC Smart-UPS unit and provided by an APC reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the APC Smart-UPS rack mount server and network infrastructure uninterrupted power supply (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) as a key component of the Department's server and network infrastructure power protection system. APC Smart-UPS power protection system works with existing hardware and software fielded in the unclassified and classified network to protect critical servers and data network infrastructure. CHANGED LINE ITEM 009 MFR NAME TO APC.  Changed component part #'s in Line Item 003.  Added Clarification End Date/ Time. Sellers must submit all requests for Clarification and questions by Friday, August 4 at 12:00 PM EST.

<DESC>Response date for this solicitation is 8 August 2006 at 2:00pm Central Time.  No more questions will be accepted after this time.  

Final Listing of Fiberoptic Questions:

1.  
Q. Clin 5) Is the fiber optic cable a 2 fiber instead of 2 conductor?
A. 6.25 MULTIMODE, FIBER (PVC, 2 FIBER, GREEN, RED, BLUE, YELLOW, GRAY, BLACK, PURPLE, PINK)

2. 
Q. You reference a eON 16 circuit analog line cord and a station (SLP) baby board.  Is the manufacturer eON?  Do you have an address or telephone number so we may contact them?  Also do you have part numbers for these items?
A.  eOn Communications Corporation
     4105 Royal Drive NW
     Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA
     800-955-5321

3.
Q. Do you have the qty of the 2 port wall plates?
A. Contractor should use the SOW and facility network diagram to yield the quantity of two port wall plates.

4.
Q. There appears to be some duplication of the Phone Items. Specifically, under Clin 4, Line Items 20, 21, 22 and 23 also appear under CLIN 5, Line Items 29, 30, 31 and 32.
A. CLIN 004 and CLIN 005 are very much alike but are for two different sides (rooms) of the vault project. When this was originally approached they were separate tasks but as the project continued to grow, this was combined under one task. Each room will still require all the necessary phone equipment to make the system work. The only real duplication is CLIN 004 item 23 and CLIN 005 item 32, it is now one 150 foot cable.
5.
Q.  The drawing shows a "Below Floor UPS Route". Is that part of this solicitation? If so what exactly are we doing with it? (possibly some of the cable tray might be for this purpose?)
A. UPS route is not part of the comm infrastructure project.

6. 
Q. Can you provide better a description, details or part numbers for the following CLINs:5-21, 5-22 and 5-26.
A.  See response to question # 3.

7. 
Q. Are there enough available vacant slots in the telephone equipment cabinet to accomodate the additional boards (CLIN 5-29 & 30), or will an expansion cabinet be required?
A. Expansion cabinet not required.

8. 
Q. There appears to be a discrepancy in the solicitation regarding the telephones. Are the new telephones to be SPEAKERPHONES or NON-SPEAKERPHONE?
A. NON_SPEAKERPHONE

9. 
Q. Can you provide an updated estimate on the amount of cable required? When amendment 1 added more cable and fiber optic, in additional colors, is this adding to the TOTAL cable length or is it simply changing the overall colors and length per color?
A. Amendment one reflects the addition of two more networks of different colors (fiber and copper). A single color bulk cable (fiber or copper) is unacceptable for this project.

10. 
Q. The RIGHT side of the drawing, at the edge of the YELLOW cable rack, he wanted about 200’ of cable left stored for future use.  What was the cable type, and what does it connect to in the Equipment Room?
A. The 100’ (not 200”) of cable is not stored for future use, it is run and stowed until the final phase of this construction. The point of this project is to connect the new to the existing infrastructure. The 100 pair phone cable will connect the phone switch located in the existing vault server room to the new construction distribution block. The 8 networks (fiber) will require the same interconnection. The wall separating the two rooms will not be opened until construction and accreditation are complete. Once we have the wall opened the fiber and phone line connecting the two server rooms can be completed. 
 
11.
Q. On the Fiber Drops on the drawing, it says “Fiber w/ MTRJ connectors;4 secure 4 standard” and the List of Materials show 6 colors of Fiber.  Do you want 1 of each color to each station(6 per drop?) or am I missing something?
A. There are 8 networks total (red, blue, green, yellow, black, grey, purple and pink). Depending on location (room) it will either be 8 fiber networks or 8 Cat5 (copper) networks (all printer drops, regardless of location, will be Cat5 copper). Since Amp/TYCO only makes secure MTRJ connectors in 4 colors (red, blue, green and, yellow) the remaining 4 fiber colors (black, grey, purple, and pink) have to use standard MTRJ connectors. As per the drawing and the SOW there are 8 network drops (one of each color) at each station.

12. 
Q. Do you have a part number of the Partner Executive phones and how many are required?
A. CORTELCO-PATRIOT NON-SPEAKERPHONE SINGLE LINE PHONE – 21  
 
13.
Q. 
CLIN Number	Line #		MFG	Notes
001	8		B-Line	Standard size is 1 5/8 Inch, please specify if you need holes or slotted?
001	13		Hoffman	Need to know if this needs to be stainless steel, NEMA rating, Height,width & depth
004	11-19		AMP	Please specify if you need phone, data, cat5e, etc 
005	1-8		Corning	Please specify if this needs to be zip cord ( 2 fibers in bonded separate jackets) or mic fiber (2 fibers in one jacket)     Minimum qty of 25K will apply because of the non standard Jacket color
005	18		AMP	need to know fiber count in order to quote correct part # (1348876-4, 559542-2, 559614-2 or 559552-2

005	23		AMP	need to know cable exit desired (90 or 180 degree) to determine part number
005	24		AMP	Please specify if you need phone, data, cat5e, etc 
005	25		Amp	Amp does not mfg white shielded jacks. Please finish description 2 port cat (what?)
All Clin #'s				Need to know quantities for all material 

A. 

1) Security dictates that we color code our networks (fiber and Cat5) and not use a bulk color (especially ORANGE because in our environment that usually indicates a higher level of classification)
2) This installation must be 100% compatible with our current infrastructure (no deviations)
3) This project amounts to 8 networks with 13 Fiber drops ea and 38 Cat5 drops each for a total of 104 MTRJ terminated fiber data drops, 304 shielded Cat5 data drops and 64 telephone drops.
4) Cabling is indoors (either fellow the floor or above the ceiling)
5) Innerduct (flexible raceway) must be capable if providing protection to fiber cable from end of cable tray to AMP floor box (flexibility is the key)
6) Black 24 port fiber patch panels

a.  The DCBR is out of range for cell phone usage.  Therefore, a “brick” radio will be issued to the contractor to communicate with range personnel in case of emergency.

b.  It was confirmed that the fence should be placed around the existing graveled area.  This should be done as square as possible.  (The actual graveled area is not 100% square.)    It was also emphasized that the contractor must keep all equipment on the graveled surface while working since the area is bordered by wetlands.  

c.  Contractor must, to ensure stability, also ensure they are installing the gate as per the manufacturers instructions.  

3. The site visit concluded at 1105 A.M.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR STRUCTURAL STRENGTH TEST BRANCH DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM ASSEMBLY.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions and ammend a part number and the quantity required. 1.  The quantity stated in the RFQ is amended to reflect the fact that we need 11 systems built.	The total number of data systems required is 11.  The SOW specifies the parts required and directions to assemble only 1 system.  We need that system built 11 times. 2.Question:  While looking at the part no. we have the following questions/comments so far: Part number 779514-01 is not available Part number 7776572-26 is not available Part number 779709-01 is not available 777966-20  do you need 32 units of this part No.?  Answer: 1) 779514-01 is the National Instruments part number for a custom developed thermocouple connector interface and does not yet appear on the NI web site.   2) 7776572-26 is not called out in the SOW.  777572-26 is called out and I see that there has been a typo.  The part number should be 776572-26 to match the SCXI-1126 8 channel freq input module. 3) 779709-01is the National Instruments part number for a custom developed strain gage completion and connector interface and does not yet appear on the NI web site. 4) Each assembly does indeed require 32 units of 777966-20.  A completed assembly will contain 256 channels of strain gage/bridge/voltage input. The due date for receipt of offers  is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 7/31/06. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<SUBJECT>D -- Enhancements to the TTB Specific Filemaker Pro Database
<SOLNBR>RFQ-NCI-60115-NV
<RESPDATE>081506

<DESC>The NCI-Office of Acquisitions received a question regarding the subject solicitation:  The question and answer is as follows:

Question 1:  Will the solution we will be working with running version 6.0 of FileMaker, or version 7 or later?  There are critical steps related to the conversation of a complex solution between FileMaker 5/5.5/6 and FileMaker 7 or 8 that need to be taken before any additional enhancements should be undertaken.

Answer 1:  The current database is running on version 8.x of FileMaker. 
  


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-60115-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-11.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Technology Transfers Branch (TTB) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to enhance the current Technology Information Management System (TIMS) database with enhanced features and re-program TIMS to maximize features of FileMaker 8.0 or most current version.  

The North American Industry Classification code is 541511, and the business size standard is $21M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.

Background:  
	General Description: The Technology Transfer Branch (TTB) of the Federal Government’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) converted eight (8) individual and separate flat files of varying record size from FileMaker Pro (FMPro) version 4.1 into a FMPro 6.0 relational database referred to as the Technology Information Management System (TIMS).  Contracts have been awarded to design the new relational database, to design a user interface, and build the database.  The TTB now requires FMPro expertise to upgrade and enhance the database.
	
	Evolution of Requirements: A self-designed “unrelated” FMPro system had been used by TTB for the management and tracking of mission-related work since the early 1990s.  In the late 1990's TTB determined that the number of records and the needs of the office had outgrown the capabilities of the “unrelated” database system.  A relationally designed database  to most efficiently maintain the integrity of and standardize the entry of data, to track mission-related efforts and to produce accurate and cogent reports was developed and has been in use since November 2002.  TTB continues to enhance TIMS to meet the changing needs of NCI and TTB.  Those needs include new technology transfer requirements, specialized reporting to the Office of the Director, NCI, and changes in TTB procedures.		
	
Purpose and Objective:

The TTB is responsible for negotiating agreements between NCI scientist and private sector companies for the collaborative development of federally funded bio-medical research into commercially successful products.  The Main focus of these collaborative efforts is to produce commercial products that will improve the public health.  In addition, the TTB is also a Competitive Service Center (CSC) for technology transfer.  Under the CSC, the TTB negotiates agreements for 10 other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health.  One of the responsibilities of these collaborative agreements is to track the agreement negotiations from initial request to execution of the agreement, and through agreement expiration to final destruction of the physical file itself.  This process can span several years and involve many tracking dates.  TTB currently negotiates eight different types of agreements for the NIH. 
	
	The specific objectives of this procurement are to: 1) enhance the current TIMS database with enhanced features such as reporting, advertising, action items, etc. and 2) re-program  TIMS to maximize the features of FileMaker 8.0 or most current version.

Statement of Work:
	CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS
	
	Specific Tasks to be Performed:  The contractor shall provide technical skills, insights and expertise on FMPro database development and implementation.  The contractor shall be a certified FileMaker Pro 8 developer.  Due to the complexity of the information that is tracked in the TIMS database, the many inter-relationships of the various agreements, and the need to obtain and integrate into TIMS data from other databases which are written in different programming languages, the contractor shall have at least 10 years FMPro experience in order to perform the work.   TTB shall provide all TTB mission-related information necessary to develop the database upon execution of contract.
	

	1.  	Add additional features to the database from the list of projects below.   The order in which additional features are selected to work on will be determined by a variety of factors such as needs of TTB, logical progression depending on re-programming (see 2 below), etc.  
	
	2.	Re-program the current TIMS database in FileMaker Pro 8.0 to maximize the features of version 8 and enhance the current database structure, file structure and user interface and produce a Beta version: The contractor shall build all of the files with field definitions, create relationships between the files, show related data, and put business rules and constraints in place on field values.  The contractor shall test the system for: 1) the database and file structure design, 2) the user interface for functionality.  Once the system is upgraded, tested, and bug free, the Contractor shall provide a beta version to TTB for testing.  The contractor shall install the Beta version on TTB's server and on 5 TTB staff members' computers.  TTB Staff shall use the beta version for 10 business days and provide comments to the Project Officer.  The Project Officer shall inform the Contractor of all comments.  Corrections and changes shall be made by the Contractor within 30 days from of receipt of comments and corrections.   The Contractor shall provide the final version of the system in a client/server format for about 51 TTB staff members.
	

	3.  	The final product shall be Section 508 compliant.
							
	PROJECTS LIST:
	

	
	1.	Reports:
		a)	Add ability to design or customize individual reports.
b)	Add/enhance ability to easily export report information into Word or Excel

	2.  	Search Function:
		a)	Enhance the search capabilities so they are more flexible and robust
		b)	Add the ability to remove or omit specific records from a found set 
	
	3.  	General
a)	Create the ability, like in old FMPro to move from record to record in a found set 	without going back and forth to a list of records. 
b)	The scroll feature needs work so that when you have scrolled down a list of 	records, selected and examined one record, and come back to the main screen,	 	you will go to the record you selected and not up to the top of the list as it 	currently is set.  [it is called Sticky Portal]
	c)	Ability to add text to modules/records
	d)	Link the status to the date field
	e)	Add Spell Check option so that it offers ability to add names, etc. so they don’t 			come up again and again. [This may be a standard feature in FMP 8+]
	f)	Make fields with pull down menus not modifiable
 
	4.  	CRADA Module
	a)	Program the amendments window to allow for page breaks and multi-page 			documents.
	b)	Make it easier to generate a CRADA amendment
	c)	The Amendment Form Header pulls from the same updated fields as the 				Clearance form, yet the information required for each is different.  Program so it 			pulls in the current information in its fields, not the new information being added 			via the amendment.  The latter should be captured in the body of the amendment. 
d)	When the months for a CRADA amendment extension are entered in the record, 	have the expiration date be automatically recalculated by the system.
e)	Appendix C Language Changes table searchable for each paragraph and ability to 	review the language.

	5.  	CTA Module

a)	Add Negotiator field and a specialist field in the CTA module as exists in all other 	agreement modules.

	6.  	AdOps Module 
		a)	Redesigned
	
	7.  	Extramural Invention Waivers 
		a)	Redesigned
	
	8.  	Letters and Memos
	a)	Have the ability to save modified letters for specific agreements within the 				agreement record in TIMS. [As a PDF file would be best.  This would be 				helpful in moving to a “document management system”.  Should also consider 			adding patent document to the EIR record, these document could include: OTT 			recommendation, original EIR, patent application, etc.]
b)	Have ability to print address labels from the contacts/org modules and to have the 	address merge into a letter.


9.	EIR Module

a)	Add Automatic Action item to generate a report if the future “Cost Sharing” 	button is added.
b)	Add ability to pull the issued patent from USPTO website.  This is relatively easy 	since there is a 	specific web-link for each Patent.  I am sure this could be applied 	to the published patent 	applications, including foreign patents and patent 	applications.  We just need the web-link 	information.
c)	Add ability to add post TRG items, similar to TRG Requests. This would help 	tracking the transactional development items in an EIR.

	10. 	Action Items

	a)	Move the Action Items toward an Agreement History, that is, remove the 				comments field and make every “comment” and Action Item a “History Item” 
b)	Certain action items should be a mandatory part of what we do (one year post 	provisional, 18 months post PCT filing, 3 months prior to CRADA expiration, 2 	months prior to CRADA LOI expiration).  TTB to decide what things need to be 	mandatory action items, then Colleen will need to program.
	
	11. 	Ability to set non-PHS/NIH contacts on Signatory List.  Currently the user can only designate PHS/NIH Contacts as “signatory”.  We need this function to identify a non-PHS/NIH Contact as signatory so their name appears on an agreement signature block.
	
	12.  	Create and store .pdf of agreement related documents 
	If standard NIH document with no modifications 
	then .pdf of signature page is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If standard NIH document with modifications 
	then .pdf of entire document is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If non-standard NIH document 
	then .pdf of entire document is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If printing an agreement, have the option to add a PDF file into TIMS (or specific location) See idea below (next bullet) for printing letter/memos/forms.
	(All scanned document are sent to a "default" location and stored so TIMS knows where to find them)
	
	13.  	Have a feature added which asks User "is this final?" when printing letter/memo/internal document. This would eliminate the multiple Automatic Action Items when documents (Letters/Memos/Forms are printed multiple times before the User is satisfied.
•	If yes, then --> 
	(a) TIMS generates an automatic .pdf, stores it in the record (allowing for retrieval/usage at later time) 
	(b) Generates automatic action item 
•	If no, then --> 
	(a) no .pdf file is generated or stored 
	(b) no automatic action is generated 
	14.  	Incorporate QC into the TIMS fields:
•	“Specialist” is filled in.
•	Status and Date fields match
&#61607;	If status is ‘active’ then execution date is completed
&#61607;	If status is ‘expired’ then expiration date has past
&#61607;	If status is ‘terminated’ then termination date is complete
&#61607;	If status is ‘withdrawn’ then withdrawn date is complete
•	For CRADAs make sure ‘Type’ is not empty
•	For CRADAs if status is active, then Abstract field is complete
•	For CRADAs if status is active, then term is not empty
•	CTAs if status is active, then ‘materials field is not empty
•	For EIRs NIH Reference number matches the appropriate type and status
•	For EIRs if the status is filed, then the filing date is not empty
•	For EIRs, if the type is EIR then the date received is complete
	15.  	Add a “sub-status” field to cover an EIR moving to Research Tool 
	16.  	Add a “Project” drawer, to track non-agreement projects.  The “Project” drawer would allow the User to ‘link’ to other agreements such that a Project could lead to an agreement. 
	17.  	Add ERROR message to MTA record if Material information (Developed under grant, Research of Human Subjects, 45 CFR Part 46 & Assurance number) are not filled out. Make this section stand out in the record (change text to red?)
	18.  	Re-design or re-word or if possible, get rid of error message created when TIMS is incorrectly exited by User.
	19.  	Add a field to MTAs for "Protocol Number".  In light of the new human subject assurance documentation, it would be helpful to have this field.
	

	DATABASE SPECIFICATIONS:.
	
	User Interface will be designed for 17 inch monitors with industry standard Web dimensions 1024 X 768 Pixels

2 Aug 06
Some of the verbiage above has been updated.  Also, to clarify: The training is for 26 Travis AFB Security Forces personnel.  As the reading says, this training is aimed at keeping them protected in deployed situations (Iraq, Afghanistan, etc).  The contractor will be responsible for the training and all major equipment!  The Security Forces will provide their own personnel equipment such as clothing and toiletries, and can provide some minor equipment such as canteens, vests, etc.  This is why it is important to outline in detail what your company provides, so we know what else our SF personnel will need to take.  The more your company provides, the better, because as I said the customer is looking for the contractor to provide just about everything.  PLEASE look over the documents that I sent to each of you and read all of the amendments to this solicitation carefully before asking questions, as most questions can be answered by doing that.  If you still require the documents e-mail me and I can forward those to you.  The response date has been extended to  9 Aug 06.

<DESC>Question:  What do you expect to see in the proposal under Roles and Responsibilities?  Answer:  Enough information to demonstrate that the contractor understands that then emphasis of this effort is for resources to participate with the execution of  the test and not to manage the test.  That is a Government responsibility.  Question:  What is expected during the Gap:  Answer:  This will be explained in this amendment.  There will be one base period and 2 options.  See below.  Question:  How does pena lties and incentives apply to this effort?  Answer:  This is performance based.  It is up to the contractor to propose incentives and penalties, but an example of a penalty could be 10% deduction off the invoice for not performing (i.e. not showing up each  day, not finishing training on time, etc.).  An example of incentives could be to reserve a percentage, such as 10%, of the total price for the final invoice to assess acceptable performance overall.  Revised Resources:  Base Period:  8/14/06 - 9/15/06 as  follows:  Week of 8/14/06:  8 resources to begin training;  Week 8/21/06: trained resources begin testing; additional 5 resources (total 13) begin training.  Week 8/28 - 9/15/06 13 resources test.  Option period 1:  9/18/06 - 11/3/06 8 resources to test.  Option period 2:  11/20/06 - 12/22/06 SAT.  The break in time between 11/3 and 11/20/06 is to allow for installation of the software in the GTF.
