<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FROM CONTRACTORS IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL FUTURE REQUIREMENT:
THE U.S. ARMY TANK AND AUTOMOTIVE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND ENGINEERING CENTER (TARDEC) REQUESTS INFORMATION REGARDING ADVANCED COOLING TECHNOLOGIES, AS DETAILED BELOW.
IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED, RESPONSES MUST BE SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS NOTICE, TO THE PERSON IDENTIFIED BELOW, AND BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN 5:00PM, DETROIT LOCAL TIME (EST), ON 16 JANUARY 2015.  RESPONSES DEVIATING FROM ANY OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY NOT BE GIVEN FURTHER CONSIDERATION.  PLEASE BE SURE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SUBMISSION:
1. INTRODUCTION.  COOLING REMAINS ONE OF THE TOP CHALLENGES FOR THE ARMY'S CURRENT AND FUTURE GROUND VEHICLE FLEET.  IN TOO MANY INSTANCES, COMBAT VEHICLE COOLING SYSTEMS HAVE FAILED TO PERFORM SATISFACTORILY IN SEVERE MILITARY ENVIRONMENTS, WITH TEMPERATURE EXTREMES LIMITING BOTH VEHICLE CLIMBING AND MAXIMUM SPEED CAPABILITY. ENGINE COMPARTMENT SPACE UNDER THE ARMOR OF COMBAT VEHICLES IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. THEREFORE THE SPACE GIVEN TO THE COOLING SYSTEM IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT FOR FULL ENGINE-POWER REALIZATION.  IN ADDITION, MANY COMBAT VEHICLES HAVE BEEN UPGRADED A NUMBER OF TIMES, INCREASING HEAT LOAD TO THE COOLING SYSTEM; AND THESE HEAT LOADS ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN FUTURE VEHICLES.  
TARDEC, IN SUPPORT OF COMBAT VEHICLE COOLING REQUIREMENTS, IS INTERESTED IN GATHERING INFORMATION TO FURTHER ITS UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY, RELIABILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS AS WELL AS REDUCE THE WEIGHT AND/OR VOLUME OF VEHICLE COOLING SYSTEMS TO OVERCOME SIZE, WEIGHT AND POWER CONSTRAINTS.  SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST FOR THIS RFI INCLUDE: 1) ENERGY EFFICIENT FANS AND FAN DRIVES, AND 2) HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEAT EXCHANGER(S).  TECHNOLOGIES OF INTEREST ARE THOSE THAT WOULD MOST RAPIDLY AND EFFECTIVELY ENHANCE THE RATE AT WHICH HEAT CAN BE REJECTED FROM A 66-TON TRACKED COMBAT VEHICLE RESULTING IN GREATER MOBILITY, INCREASED POWER FOR ACCESSORIES AND/OR ADDITIONAL RANGE FOR A WIDER VARIETY OF POSSIBLE MISSIONS.  THE RESPONDENT IS FREE TO RESPOND IN REGARD TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES.  
2. SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST:
ENERGY EFFICIENT FANS AND FAN DRIVES:  THE NEED FOR MORE EFFICIENT FANS AND FAN DRIVES ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT VEHICLE MOBILITY IS LESS THAN OPTIMAL FROM A COOLING SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE.  ACROSS THE ARMY FLEET, THE COOLING SYSTEM CONSUMES SIGNIFICANT ENGINE POWER WHILE REMOVING HEAT FROM THE VEHICLE'S PROPULSION SYSTEM.  THIS PLACES A CONSIDERABLE BURDEN ON THE VEHICLE AND DEGRADES MOBILITY.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS IN FAN GEOMETRY AND FAN DRIVE COMPONENTS COULD PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN COMBAT VEHICLE MOBILITY.  
TARDEC IS LOOKING FOR COMPACT FANS AND FAN DRIVES FOR COMBAT VEHICLE USE, THAT EXHIBIT HIGH EFFICIENCY ACROSS THE OPERATING SPEED AND PROVIDE THE COOLING NEEDED WHILE REQUIRING LESS POWER THAN CURRENT METHODS IN THE U.S. ARMY INVENTORY.  THESE COMPONENTS SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING A MILITARY ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING EXTREME TEMPERATURES, HIGH HUMIDITY, SHOCK AND VIBRATION.  THE DESIGN SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING A MASS AIRFLOW OF 2000 LBM/MIN WITH A FAN INLET AIR DENSITY OF 0.055 LBM/FT3 AND A FAN STATIC PRESSURE RISE OF 31 INCHES OF WATER.  POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS MAY REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO ANY SUBSEQUENT OPERATIONAL EXPERIMENTATION AT A TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) OF 6.  THE RESPONDENT IS FREE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE FAN AND/OR FAN DRIVE AND/OR BOTH.  POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS MIGHT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING:  
1. IMPROVEMENTS TO FAN BLADE GEOMETRY 2. IMPROVEMENTS TO THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF FAN DRIVES 3. ALTERNATIVES TO FAN DRIVE CONTROL SUBSYSTEMS WITH CONTROL STRATEGIES FOR MATCHING POWER USED FOR COOLING WITH ACTUAL VEHICLE COOLING DEMANDS. 4. APPROACHES FOR REDUCING WEIGHT AND VOLUME
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEAT EXCHANGER(S): COMBAT VEHICLES ARE REQUIRED TO OPERATE OVER ALL TYPES OF DIFFERENT TERRAIN AND UNDER SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL EXTREMES.  INCREASING DEMANDS ON COMBAT VEHICLE ENGINE POWER AND PERFORMANCE HAVE NECESSITATED IMPROVEMENT IN HEAT EXCHANGER EFFECTIVENESS TO MEET THE INCREASED HEAT LOADS OF THE VEHICLE.  
TARDEC IS LOOKING FOR COMPACT HEAT EXCHANGERS FOR COMBAT VEHICLE USE THAT ARE RUGGED AND EXHIBIT HIGH AIRSIDE EFFECTIVENESS AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING THE RATE AT WHICH HEAT CAN BE REJECTED FROM THE VEHICLE WITHIN GIVEN SPACE CLAIM CONSTRAINTS.  TECHNOLOGIES OF INTEREST SHOULD HAVE MINIMAL AIR PRESSURE DROP ACROSS THE HEAT EXCHANGER, AND MINIMAL COOLANT PRESSURE DROP THROUGH THE HEAT EXCHANGER WHILE OPERATING AT COOLANT (50/50 ETHYLENE GLYCOL/WATER) TEMPERATURES OF 230?F AND AIR TEMPERATURES OF 120?F.  THE SOLUTION SHOULD PROVIDE AT LEAST 3690 BTU/ (MIN*FT2) HEAT REJECTION CAPABILITY.  THE SOLUTION SHOULD HAVE COMPACT DIMENSIONS, LOW MASS, HIGH RELIABILITY, AND BE COST EFFECTIVE.  POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS MAY REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO ANY SUBSEQUENT OPERATIONAL EXPERIMENTATION AT A TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) OF 6.  POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS MIGHT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING:  
1. IMPROVEMENTS TO MAXIMUM AIRSIDE EFFECTIVENESS 2. STRATEGIES TO EXPOSE MORE COOLANT THROUGH THE CORE TO THE COOLEST AIR. 3. OPTIMIZATION OF AIRFLOW THROUGH HEAT EXCHANGER CORE. 4. COOLING MODULES THAT REDUCE WEIGHT AND/OR VOLUME
3. PROPEITARY INFORMATION. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT (USG) ACKNOWLEDGES ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (18 U.S.C. ?1905) TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE GOVERNMENT. PURSUANT TO THIS STATUTE, THE USG IS WILLING TO ACCEPT ANY TRADE SECRETS OR PROPRIETARY RESTRICTIONS PLACED UPON DATA PRESENTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SURVEY AND TO PROTECT SUCH INFORMATION FROM UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE, SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING:
-DATA MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED PROPRIETARY AND BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN EXPLANATORY TEXT SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS CLEARLY NOTIFIED REGARDING WHAT DATA IS PROPRIETARY. -MARK ONLY DATA THAT IS TRULY COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL. -DO NOT MARK DATA THAT IS ALREADY IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN OR IS ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE USG OR THIRD PARTIES ON AN UNCLASSIFIED BASIS. DO NOT SUBMIT ANY CLASSIFIED DATA IN RESPONSE TO THIS MARKET SURVEY. -PROPRIETARY DATA TRANSMITTED ELECTRONICALLY MUST HAVE THE PROPRIETARY LEGEND ON BOTH THE COVER OF THE TRANSMITTAL EMAIL AS WELL AS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILE. PROPRIETARY INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THE CORRESPONDENCE SHALL USE THE LEGENDS: "PROPRIETARY PORTION" BEGINS AND "PROPRIETARY PORTION" ENDS.
4. DISCLAIMER. THIS RFI IS FOR A MARKET SURVEY. IT IS AN INQUIRY INTENDED TO MEASURE THE PRODUCT CAPABILITY, DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS, AND LEVEL OF INDUSTRY INTEREST. RESPONSES TO THIS SURVEY MAY AFFECT THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO ISSUE SOLICITATIONS FOR FUTURE CONTRACTS FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.

<SUBJECT>Combined Federal Campaign Centralized Campaign Administration Services
<SOLNBR>OPM16-15-R-0001
<CONTACT>Cheryl D Allen, Contracting Officer, Phone 202.606.2054 , Fax 202.606.1464, Email Cheryl.Allen@opm.gov
<DESC>The Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) is the world's largest workplace giving program with almost 200 CFCs throughout the country and overseas raising millions of dollars each year. The CFC is managed and overseen by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which is responsible for ensuring that the campaign is effectively and efficiently administered, and that all campaign components meet Federal laws and regulations. This includes Executive Order 12353, as amended, of March 23, 1982, and Solicitation of Federal Civilian and Uniformed Service Personnel for Contributions to Private Voluntary Organizations (Chapter 950 of title 5 U.S.C., amended April 2014, effective January 2016). Pledges made by Federal civilian, postal and military donors during the campaign season (currently September 1st to December 15th) support eligible non-profit organizations that provide health and human service benefits throughout the world. The Director of OPM has designated responsibility for day-to-day management of the CFC to its Office of Combined Federal Campaign.
<p>In this procurement, we intend to contract for CFC Centralized Campaign Administration services.

<p>The requirements for the Central Campaign Administrator (CCA) are set forth in the regulations at 5 CFR &sect; 950.106. Visit the following website: https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/04/17/2014-08574/solicitation-of-federal-civilian-and-uniformed-service-personnel-for-contributions-to-private. The regulations at 5 CFR &sect; 950.106 state, "OPM may contract with one or more organizations classified by the Internal Revenue Service as 501(c)(3) organizations, to perform the centralized fiscal and administrative functions of the CFC. One organization will be responsible for developing and maintaining a centralized Web site for the CFC that will include an online application function for charities applying to participate in the CFC and an online pledging function for Federal donor use. All organizations will be responsible for disbursing funds received from the Federal payroll offices or service providers. If OPM contracts with more than one organization, the disbursement responsibilities will be divided between them based on Federal Shared Service Centers and Federal payroll offices. For example, if OPM contracts with four organizations, one would handle all agencies that use the National Finance Center as their Shared Service Center regardless of the location of the donor or the agency. Only non-CFC participating organizations may be selected as CCAs."</p>
<p>A CFC participating organization cannot serve as a subcontractor to a CCA or serve in any other capacity. A non-CFC participating organization can serve as a subcontractor to a CCA as long as all charitable contributions are handled by the 501(c)(3) organization.</p>
<p>We may award one or more contracts. The proposed contract(s) will be firm-fixed-price. The performance period for the proposed contract(s) is expected to be five years: a three-year base period plus two one-year options.</p>
<p>OPM intends to issue a request for proposals (RFP) on or about December 22, 2014. The RFP and all documents relating to this requirement will only be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO website for release of the RFP and all other documents relating to this requirement. We encourage interested parties to register on the FBO website for e-mail notification of all actions relating to the RFP and for the interested vendors list. After we release the RFP, we will give interested parties the opportunity to ask questions. We will include all questions and answers in an amendment to the RFP and post the amendment on the FBO website.</p>
<p>Proposals will be due on or about January 22, 2015. We anticipate awarding the proposed contract(s) by April 2015.</p>
<p>This is a new requirement. There is no incumbent contractor.</p>

<DESC>Purpose
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Air Traffic Organization (ATO), Office of Navigation Services (AJM-32)  is  assessing the feasibility and cost effectiveness of outsourcing the service provision of the Very High Frequency (VHF) Omni-Directional Range (VOR) Minimum Operating Network (VOR MON).  The FAA currently provides the VOR service organically. 

Background:
For over 50 years, aircraft have flown routes defined by VOR to navigate throughout the NAS.  In the early 1990s, the FAA embarked on a transition to satellite navigation enabled by the Global Navigation Satellie Systems (GNSS) to enable aircraft to fly efficiently between any two points, using Area Navigation (RNAV), instead of the flying less inefficient paths between two VOR Navigation Aids (NAVAIDs) under conventional navigation.  The operational improvements planned for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) depend on more widespread use of RNAV.  Therefore, as NextGen progresses, the need for VORs will decline and the enabling navigation infrastructure must be right-sized to reduce and avoid unnecessary costs.  However, GNSS signals are highly susceptible to radio frequency interference so a portion of the current inventory of VORs will be retained to provide a conventional navigation backup to GNSS.  Consequently, the FAA is preparing a plan to reduce the current inventory of 967 VORs by approximately 443 and retain approximately 524 facilities as the VOR MON.  

VOR MON Service Provision includes:
1)	VOR MON Implementation support to discontinue existing VOR NAVAIDs from the current level of 967 by approximately 50% for the  VOR MON  to include:
a)	Relocation of collocated services
b)	Expand the service volume from 1000 AGL at 40 miles to 5000 AGL at 77 miles.
c)	Support for any other action required for the discontinuace ( documentation , charting and procedures update.)
2)	Operation and maintenance of all VOR Navaid facilities across the US NAS to include:
a)	# VOR H Class
b)	# VOR L Class
c)	# VOR T Class

3)	Provision of service to ensure each facility type, identified in 1, meets all system certification requirements, standards, and tolerances with an availability of 99.7%.
4)	Technical refresh and/or replacement of the NAVAID facilities in 2 to meet the service provision requirement in 3 throughout the lifecycle.
5)	Logitics support, supply support, and training to meet the provision of service requirement identified in 3.

The principle North American Industry Classification Systems Code is 541330.
The purpose of this market survey is to encourage statements of interest and capabilities from business concerns capable of providing the required services.  

Please submit  your capability statement that should include:
	A statement of your firms experience within the past 10 years in providing turn key solution for services.
	A description of the proposed approach to provide the VOR MON services.
	A rough order of magnitude cost estimate 
Please limit your response to no more than 25 pages, exclusive of resumes.

Please provide your response to  this market survey not later than January 28, 2015, 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time to Larry Mendelson at Larry.Mendelson@faa.gov.  Phone calls will not be accepted.  Please include MARKET SURVEY RESPONSE: VOR MON Service Provision, in the subject line of your email.  Information provided will not be released; however, please mark PROPRIETARY on all documents submitted as necessary. 

This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal nor an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire any products/services. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. A procurement package is not available. No entitlement to payment will arise as a result of submission of responses to this market survey.

<p>1. NOTICE</p>
<p>1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if future efforts can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334418, which has a corresponding size standard of 500 employees.

<p>1.2 This notice is a Sources Sought, and is not a request for competitive proposals, quotations or an invitation for bid.

These costs remain solely the responsibility of the responding contractor. Information provided will be used solely for planning and market research purposes in determining the competitive atmosphere for these assets.</p>
<p>2. SCOPE</p>
<p>2.1 AFLCMC/WNABC has a valid requirement and is seeking contractors who have skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully build the I/O Board. If a contract is awarded, it is anticipated to be a one-time buy.</p>
<p>2.2 The I/O Board is part of the Stores System Tester (SST) Instrument Unit (IU) for the F-16 weapon system.</p>
<p>2.3 Prequalification is required prior to being considered for contract award. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control authority in order to maintain the quality of the part. The approved sources retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, and technical data that are not economically available to the government, and the data and knowledge are essential to maintaining the quality of the part. P/N 8353244P001 is a BAE drawing. A potential new source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures as defined with the Source Qualification Statement (SQS).</p>
<p>3. DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>3.1 This Sources Sought does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished and responding to this request in no manner guarantees a contract will be awarded to the respondent. The information provided is to the best of the Government's knowledge of plans, desires, and general situation as it exists at the time of the Sources Sought. This potential requirement is in the planning phase and, therefore, all information is potentially subject to change.</p>

<p>2.2 The I/O Board is part of the Stores System Tester (SST) Instrument Unit (IU) for the F-16 weapon system.</p>
<p>2.3 Prequalification is required prior to being considered for contract award. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control authority in order to maintain the quality of the part. The approved sources retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, and technical data that are not economically available to the government, and the data and knowledge are essential to maintaining the quality of the part. P/N 8353244P001 is a BAE drawing. A potential new source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures as defined with the Source Qualification Statement (SQS).</p>
<p>3. DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>3.1 This Sources Sought does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished and responding to this request in no manner guarantees a contract will be awarded to the respondent. The information provided is to the best of the Government's knowledge of plans, desires, and general situation as it exists at the time of the Sources Sought. This potential requirement is in the planning phase and, therefore, all information is potentially subject to change.</p>

<DESC>1. RFI Announcement<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotations. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential respondent's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach. Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Interested vendors responding to this RFI may provide capability information for any pieces of this requirement or for an entire solution. Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided; however information gathered may be utilized for technical and acquisition purposes. The U.S. Government will not pay for any costs associated with such demonstration(s) of any software products.
<p>This RFI will be open from the date of release for 30 calendar days. This RFI is requested of companies currently involved in the market place where these services/products are available and in production.<br /><br />2. Scope<br />The Department of Homeland Security, United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) is conducting research for an on-line/electronic FOIA/Privacy Act workflow and processing system. This will be a replacement/upgrade to the existing system. A solution must be capable of interfacing with other components of the USCIS suite of systems, and it must be a COTS based solution that can be configured to provide the functionality and workflows to support processes performed by FOIA/PA staff.</p>
<p>In addition, USCIS requires information about support services including but not limited to: project management, system integration and implementation, migration of existing data, ongoing system maintenance requirements, help desk support and transition to operations and maintenance.<br /><br />3. Background<br />The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended (5 U.S.C. &sect; 552), permits any person to request access to federal agency records. The FOIA establishes a presumption that records in the possession of Federal departments and agencies are accessible to people, except to the extent that the records are protected from disclosure by any of the nine exemptions contained in the law or by one of three special law enforcement record exclusions.</p>
<p>The Privacy Act (PA) of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. &sect; 552a), embodies a code of fair information principles that govern the collection, use, and dissemination of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by federal departments. The PA provides U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents (LPR) with the opportunity to request access to Federal department and agency records that are maintained on an individual. USCIS manages its FOIA/PA program in accordance with DHS policy. Any PII that is collected, used, maintained, and/or disseminated in connection with a mixed system by DHS shall be treated as a system of records subject to the Privacy Act, regardless of whether the information pertains to a U.S. citizen, LPR, visitor, or alien. If a requested document contains the PII of an individual other than the requestor, information in the associated records must be redacted by totally concealing the information that completely removes the PII.</p>
<p>The USCIS National Records Center (NRC) receives approximately 145,000 FOIA/PA requests annually. USCIS FOIA requests fall under two categories:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; A-File requests, which include requests for information contained in A-File or <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requests for a complete copy of an A-File. A-Files contain all records of any active <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case of an alien not yet naturalized as they passed through the United States <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immigration and inspection process. Approximately 98% of the FOIA requests <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received at USCIS are for A-Files and A-File materials. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; Significant Information Group (SIG) requests, which include requests concerning <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agency processes, procedures, reports, statistics, and other matters not directly&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; related to or contained within an A-File and represents approximately 2% of the&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOIA requests received at USCIS.</p>
<p>To respond to these requests, the NRC FOIA/PA staff search for "responsive records" in DHS/USCIS systems (e.g., National File Tracking System, Central Index System, Electronic Document Management System, etc.) and import data/information as needed. Responsive records are defined as any records, whether in electronic or paper form, that pertain to the information being requested. For example, if information on an A-file is requested, all documents contained within a specific A-file would be considered "responsive records." The responsive records range in size from 50 to 15,000 pages per file.</p>
<p>The existing application used by USCIS to respond to FOIA/PA requests is the FOIA/PA Information Processing System (FIPS). This is a web-based application that supports on-line processing from the initial request (paper based form) received at the National Records Center (NRC) through providing a response to the requestor. The forms and supporting documents are digitized utilizing the Scan on Demand (SODA) application's Captiva module dedicated for FIPS; the digitized images with associated metadata (stored in an XML file) are transmitted to FIPS via nightly network copy. The information is then processed through electronic workflows to determine the records needed to respond to the request, redact information, generate letters and associated information to be sent to the requestor via printed documents, CDs, or email as needed. Through an interface, the application provides information on the status of the request to the requestor.</p>
<p>The user base for this application is approximately 200 staff members at the National Records Center where an estimated 150 users telework 3 days a week. In addition, there are approximately 20 users at USCIS Service Centers, USCIS Headquarters/Office of Records and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>4. High Level Functional Needs<br />The list of requirements and preferences by end users and the Office of Information Technology are contained in Appendix A and B of this RFI. The best result would be to address the functional needs using a COTS package that can be configured to meet the preferences with minimal customizations. <br /><br />5. Relevant DHS/USCIS Compliance<br />Any recommended solution, must meet the DHS established department-wide IT security program standards based on the following Executive Orders (EO), public laws, and national policies as identified in Appendix C of this document.<br /><br />6. Instructions for Responding to RFI<br />Interested parties should provide the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.

<DESC>Summary of Announcement: This notice is to announce the upcoming release by NASA of an amendment to the ROSES-2014 NASA Research Announcement (NRA) soliciting proposals for development of an Extreme Precision Doppler Spectrometer for the Wisconsin, Indiana, Yale and NOAO (WIYN) 3.5-m telescope at Kitt Peak. <p> Background and Details:  In its report, "New Worlds, New Horizons," the Astro2010 Decadal Survey challenged NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to "support an aggressive program of ground-based high-precision radial velocity surveys of nearby stars in order to validate and characterize exoplanet candidates."  In response to that challenge, the two agencies recently announced the establishment of a new partnership for exoplanet research. This NASA-NSF Exoplanet Observational Research (NN-EXPLORE) partnership will take advantage of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) share of the 3.5-m WIYN telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory to provide the community with telescope access and tools to conduct ground based observations that advance exoplanet science. The NN-EXPLORE partnership will particularly emphasize research to validate space-based transit observations (e.g. K2, The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) or to inform the exoplanet observations of future NASA missions (e.g. James Webb Space Telescope and Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope/Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets. <P> In accordance with Astro2010, the cornerstone of the NN-EXPLORE partnership will be a new, NASA-funded Extreme Precision Doppler Spectrometer (EPDS) installed as a facility instrument on the WIYN telescope. NASA will require that the EPDS be capable of delivering a radial velocity precision of less than 50 cm/s, with a goal of ~10 cm/s. The goal is for the EPDS to be available for use in facility mode as early as FY 2018. To this end, NASA has identified a funding profile totaling $7M over the period FY 2015  FY 2018, although the final budget and funding profile will be determined after review of the proposed instruments. <P> This community announcement is issued to provide the scientific community with advance notice that NASA plans to release a solicitation in the near future for the purposes of procuring the above EPDS. The solicitation will be released as an amendment to the ROSES-2014 NRA, and is expected to be issued in early January 2015. The due date for proposals will be not less than 90 days after the release of the solicitation.

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The last decade has produced a remarkable transformation in the digital world. Enlistees being sworn-in the fall of 2014 were born in 1996; back then, service members and their families used a computer with a modem on a desk to connect to the Internet and their new electronic-mail accounts.</p>

Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI with their comments, concerns, questions or suggestions. The RFI is part of the acquisition planning and market research phase for this acquisition. The input received from this RFI will be considered in preparing the official solicitation package.<br />The Government's intent is to obtain responses to the objectives listed above to survey the current marketplace to assist in the development of this requirement and determining the appropriate acquisition strategy.</p>

<p>As a result of this Sources Sought announcement, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage that can fulfil the requirements, in accordance with the requirement descriptions and technical specifications indicated below, then this acquisition may be solicited as a small business set aside. However, NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, SDVOSB and VOSB). This requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 334510. The specific purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is to determine if there are small businesses, within the parameters identified above, that are capable of providing the services identified.</p>
<p>Interested business organizations that believe they are capable of meeting the requirement should submit electronic copies or mailed copies of their capability statement. Please limit responses to five (5) pages or less. Responses should include the following information:</p>

<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Requirement overview:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>NIST's Quantum Sensors' Group )QSG) develops detectors based on superconductivity that operate at low temperatures, ranging from 50mK to 4K. Cooling these detectors use specialized cryogenic cooling systems. Although there are commercial off-the-shelf cooling systems, these are typical very large and consume too much power for our detector systems. NIST is presently undertaking a development effort to miniaturize these cooling systems. As part of this effort, NIST is developing a compact cryocooler capable of reaching 1.5K for cooling Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors. This cooler consists of staging two separate cooling systems- a pulse tube for reaching 10K and a JT cooler for reaching 1K. For the purposes of this procurement, NIST is developing the pulse tube coldhead using a commercial Pressure Wave Generator.</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE</p>
<p>This procurement is for the commercial Pressure Wave Generator (PWG). This will provide the pressure wave necessary for operation of the pulse tube coldhead. The function of the PWG is closely tied to the pulse tube coldhead, and in fact, the design of the coldhead is predicated on the operating parameters of the PWG. The PWG we are procuring is based on a standard commercial PWG, but with minor modifications to facilitate integration with the pulse tube coldhead</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>Pressure Wave Generator<br />Dual Opposed Pistons<br />Piston maximum amplitude 6mm: 0-P<br />Piston Diameter: 1.5"<br />Piston Mass (per piston): 1.135 kg<br />Spring constant (per side): 4.1 x 104 Nt/m<br />500W maximum input power<br />400W maximum acoustic power output <br />Operating Frequency: 35Hz<br />Charge Pressure: 1.5MPa<br />Actuator constant (per side): &gt;730 (Nt/A)2/ohm</p>
<p><br />Any proprietary information should be so marked. The written capability statement should be received by the Contract Specialist no later than 11:00 pm MST December 19, 2014. The capability statement shall identify the business status of the organization.</p>
<p>Only electronic statements will be accepted. Faxes will not be accepted. Send to Contract Specialist Miguel Vasquez at Miguel.Vasquez@Nist.gov. Direct all questions to this e-mail no later than December 18, 11:00AM MST.</p>

<DESC>Patents End-to-End (PE2E) will be the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office's (USPTO) next-generation IT infrastructure, supporting patents business operations. The PE2E system will replace the nearly four (4) dozen aging legacy systems used today with a single system that unifies electronic processing over the entire patent application lifecycle (hence "end-to-end"). &nbsp;
<p><br />Office Action authoring is a critical component of patent examination and involves data collection from various sources which are copied and appended, along with form paragraphs(predefined legal language containing statutory rules and regulation information) and feedback from the patent examiner onto the Office Action Editor. The editor queries standard form paragraphs which are constantly updated so that the examiner is able to insert standard form paragraphs where needed.</p>
<p>The USPTO seeks an online editor solution which will replace the existing legacy Office Action editing system. The current legacy system is based on MS Word with Macros which have been customized to perform the crucial functions. The future online editor shall be able to support a variety of document formats and should leverage current web based technology and industry best practices.</p>
<p><br />As the PE2E system will operate on web representations of all patent application documents from initial filing to publication, this RFI seeks to obtain information from interested parties, including the vendor community, about potential solutions to the problem of editing and commenting documents on a web based platform as well as potential opportunities to find solutions to support office action processing. The USPTO is exploring a wide range of possible solutions for several web based document editing software which can support collaborative editing.</p>
<p>The proposed solution needs to support 15,000 active users with real time response time even when editing documents sized 100+ pages. Each document may contain images, tables, and comments with multiple fonts, paragraphs, headers and footers on the document.</p>
<p><br />The future authoring editor shall support up to 15,000 active users and support editing documents in a web-based environment. The editing environment shall be able to support multiple page formats, layouts, fonts and paragraphs along with header and footer.</p>

VISN 2 is seeking a company to recycle media/computer equipment into raw materials and/or dispose of such equipment at no cost to the Government.   VISN 2 Logistics will establish a No-Cost Contract wherein the government will not pay for such services.  The Contractor will be required to pick-up and remove all designated waste from the facility locations outlined in Section 7 within 5 days after first notification unless otherwise agreed between both parties.  The Contractor itself is required to remove all media equipment and remove stored information according to DOD and HIPAA standards.  Certificates of destruction will be provided to each VA facility within 30 days of pick up.  VA Medical Centers will receive a full detailed report along with removing liability from VA Medical Centers to the Contractor of all hard drives being destroyed, including date received, Manufacturer, Model #, Serial #, Asset Tag # to include total weight of all recyclable media items.  The Contractor must be a R2/RIOS certified electronics recycler and possess all relevant permits and/or licenses to engage in the recycling and/or destruction activities described herein.   

3	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS
The Contractor is required to be in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws related to environmental health/safety standards, to include VA and agency policies concerning security, including, but not limited to the following:  
OSHAS 18001 - R2 RIOS Certified Electronics Recycler. 
NIST 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization
FSS SOP MP Media Protection
VA HB 6500.1 Media Sanitization
The Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR):   www.acqnet.gov/FAR/

4	SPECIFIC TASKS
Task 1 - The Contractor will be required to pick-up, remove, and transport offsite all designated equipment from the Veteran Affairs Medical Center locations outlined in Section 7 within 5 days after notification unless otherwise agreed between both parties.
Task 2 - The Contractor will provide pallets, and palletizing of material and transport to the nearest recycling facility.
Task 3 - The facility will have all items (hard drives for destruction and multi-media items) ready for pick up on designated date and time.  

5	DELIVERABLES AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE
The Contractor's services will be required on an "on-call" basis, as needed, and will occur during normal business hours.  Notifications will be administered in writing, or telephonically and followed up in writing.  Normal business hours at the designated VA Medical Facilities are from 7:30 am - 4:00 pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.  
Upon completion of Contractor's destruction and/or recycling processes, the Contractor will provide each Medical facility a certificate of destruction certifying that all materials were destroyed.  The contractor will also pay each Medical Facility a fair and competitive rate (per pound) for all recyclable equipment being picked up.  This will be completed within 30-days from the date of pick-up.  

Each Medical Center information security officer will conduct Media Sanitization Procedures within each facility (as needed) to ensure all hard drives being picked up are secure and ready for transport. 
Any hard drive leaving the control of VA must be prepared according to NIST 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, standards and/or have FIPS 140-2 encryption.  During transit to the contractor media must be protected.   In order to accomplish this all VA hard drives will be degaussed and the contractor will physically damage all hard drives using an approved/recommended tool prior to shipping for recycling to a third vendor.  Only officially approved shipping containers will be used to transport storage media to the contracted sanitization site.  

6	GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT 
No government-furnished equipment will be provided to the Contractor.  VA facilities will provide the vendor desktop monitors, laptops and other electronic devices that can be recycled.  All equipment will be coded out in accordance with VA/Federal regulations before being transferred.  

7	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE
The work will be performed at the following six VA Medical Center locations.  Facility CIO contact info is also provided:  VA Facilities will follow roles and responsibilities as it pertains to the security of shipped equipment as well as providing the notification procedures and points of contact for a security breach of the facilities infrastructure.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only. It is intended to be used for preliminary planning purposes. <br>  <br> No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. <br>  <br> THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR BID. CURRRENTLY THERE IS NOT A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE NOR WILL THERE BE A CONTRACT AWARDED RESULTING FROM THIS NOTICE. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -Kansas City District has been tasked to provide market research to identify sources that have the capacity and capability to perform scientific studies on the Missouri River between The Big Sioux River in Sioux City, Iowa and the Iowa/Missouri state line in the state of Iowa. The work requires a firm possess the biological experience, expertise, knowledge, and refined techniques to conduct scientific surveys and research studies on the Missouri River related to research and recovery goals for the Pallid Sturgeon as prescribed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Biological Opinion for the Missouri River, dated 2000, as amended in 2003. <br>  <br> The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members in the industry. The type of solicitation to issue will depend upon the responses to this sources sought notice. <br>  <br> Interested firms are hereby invited to submit a response to this market survey to demonstrate their technical, managerial and business capability to provide the requested services. Firms may be required to perform all or part of the following services: <br>  <br> A) Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment: Biological surveys for pallid sturgeon and other native fish species and habitat data collection will be conducted in accordance with the most current guiding documents for  quote mark Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment quote mark  (most recent version is Drobish 2008) and  quote mark Missouri River Standard Operating Procedures for Fish Sampling and Data Collection quote mark  (most recent version is Drobish 2008). All data are recorded on standardized data sheets and followed by implementing a variety of QA/QC procedures.  An annual report that summarizes each year's data collection effort is required.  The contractor is also required to attend up to three meetings and up to two trainings directly associated with the Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Program. <br>  <br> B) Pallid Sturgeon Propagation: This component provides support for propagation, culture, and population augmentation activities associated with annual stocking goals for pallid sturgeon.  Activities associated with pallid sturgeon propagation include:  broodstock collection, sexing, transport; egg staging and spawning; cryopreservation of genetic material; egg incubation and shipment; culture of fry and fingerling; maintaining captive broodstock; tagging; and stocking.  An annual summary report that is in accordance with a standardized format will be submitted highlighting the propagation activities.  <br>   <br> The Corps has the responsibility to work cooperatively with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to capture, hold and spawn broodstock annually.  The Corps is responsible for a portion of the annual stocking identified as the  quote mark Average annual shortfall quote mark  in the 2000 Opinion and 2003 Amendment to the 2000 Opinion.   <br>  <br> C) Aquatic Habitat Assessment and Monitoring:  For the benefit of pallid sturgeon, the Corps, through management actions or site-level projects, creates and then monitors aquatic habitat in the channelized segment of the Missouri River.  The contractor will be responsible for assessing improvements/changes in the physical habitat characteristics associated with the channelized river, and the biological response to those habitat changes.  All data are recorded on standardized data sheets and followed by implementing a variety of QA/QC procedures.  An Annual Report that summarizes each year's data collection efforts is required.  The contractor is also required to attend meetings and training directly associated with assessment and monitoring activities; it is estimated that there will be five total occurrences.  All sampling must be consistent with the most recent version of the guiding document for  quote mark Pallid Sturgeon Habitat Assessment and Monitoring quote mark  (most recent version is Sampson and Drobish 2008) and  quote mark Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Project quote mark  (most recent version is Drobish 2008) and  quote mark Missouri River Standard Operating Procedures for Fish Sampling and Data Collection quote mark  (most recent version is Drobish 2008) documents as referenced. <br>  <br> D) Aquatic Ecosystem Response: This would include monitoring to assess the biologic response of native species including game and non-game species as well as changes to primary and secondary productivity that result from in-channel and off-channel aquatic habitat creation efforts. This data would provide the information needed to make informed adaptive management decisions related to habitat creation in order to insure recovery of the ecosystem on which the pallid sturgeon relies. <br>  <br> E) Scientific Studies: To support learning and progress towards recovery of the pallid sturgeon, certain research activities are required to improve understanding, identify relationships, and resolve uncertainty (knowledge gaps) for pallid biology and ecology.  As the recovery process moves forward, priority information needs will be identified, some of which are included in the Ruckelshaus Report (Bergman et al. 2008).  Data collection and research study design and analysis may be conducted to address high priority information needs for pallid sturgeon in the middle basin of the Missouri River.  These needs are identified, in part, on pages 25-27 in the Ruckelshaus Report (Bergman et al. 2008) under four categories (Early Life Stages, Habitat, Reproduction, and Population Assessment). <br>  <br> This notice is provided as information to the marketplace and is an invitation for an expression of interest for firms to demonstrate a capability to perform the anticipated work. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate.

<p>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day to provide information on the release of the Advanced RF Mapping (RadioMap) Phase 3 Broad Agency Announcement (DARPA-BAA-15-07). The Proposers' Day will be held on January 6, 2015 at the DARPA Conference Center (DCC), 675 North Randolph Street, Arlington, VA 22203-2114 from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern Time. The purpose of the Proposers' Day is to provide information on the RadioMap<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </strong>program, promote additional discussion on this topic, and address questions from potential proposers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Proposers' Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposer's Day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The overall goal of the RadioMap program is to leverage existing Radio Frequency (RF) devices such as tactical radios and jammers to provide universal RF situational awareness, with a focus on (1) information about nearby threats and opportunities to support leaders of small tactical units, and (2) broad-area mapping to cue and support Electronic Warfare (EW), Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and spectrum management systems and specialists. Prior work in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of RadioMap developed and demonstrated technology for near-real-time RF mapping and for employing existing RF devices efficiently and flexibly as components of a sensor network. The program also architected and prototyped an underlying software system that leverages and coordinates available RF devices, while supporting rapid integration of new applications. The primary goal of Phase 3 is to further develop the technology created in RadioMap Phase 1 and Phase 2 into a full system suitable for transition to the U. S. Marine Corps. Phase 3 activities supporting this goal include continued technology development, system integration, and participation in U. S. Marine Corps field exercises employing tactical RF devices.</p>

<DESC>This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Fiscal Year 2014 (FY14) Defense Medical Research and Development Program (DMRDP), Joint Program Committee 1 (JPC-1), Medical Simulation and Information Sciences Research Program (MSIS), Team Performance Training (TPT) Research Initiative.  The FY14 TPT Research Initiative seeks to support research into the design, plan, and components of an effective, efficient, interactive, user-friendly, evidence-based team performance trainer with automated assessment technology, which will improve team performance in delivery of healthcare with the overall goal of reducing medical errors/adverse events, and improving patient safety and healthcare outcomes. Focus on single-user interactive experiences is encouraged, but the FY14 TPT Research Initiative does not limit research to just single-user interactive experiences. The proposed automated assessment technology should analyze the individual's (and other team members') performance within a team situation/scenario and provide guidance toward optimal behaviors with the overall goal of reducing medical errors and improving healthcare outcomes. The primary goal is to perform critical research to gain knowledge on an optimal, best-practice, evidence-based framework, design, plan, and components to obtain optimal team performance training models, and to document, analyze, and report the knowledge and information regarding the nature and extent of improved communication skills and team performance in healthcare training simulation systems. Research supported by this BAA should provide the fundamental knowledge, potential frameworks, designs and plans, and recommendations (both clinical and technical) to support the future development of an interactive team performance training system that can assess the downstream effects of the individual's, as well as the team's, behaviors and medical decisions have on patient safety outcomes.  The full announcement and submission instructions are located on the Grants.gov web site, accessed at http://www.grants.gov.  Perform a search using the BAA number W81XWH-14-DMRDP-JPC1-TPT or CFDA number 12.420.  A full proposal/application must be submitted through Grants.gov.

<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:manabu.mitomi.ja@usmc.mil">Manabu Mitomi / Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>MCIPAC Marine Corps Regional Contracting Office intends to solicit and negotiate a sole-source, firm-fixed price (FFP), GSA Task Order with SYNCSORT; 50 Tice Boulevard Suite 250 Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey 07677.  The procurement will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 13.106(b)(1), Soliciting from a Single Source.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

This requirement is for the following items:

1) Silver Level Support and Service - per year  
Qty: 1 Year
Part Number: 9902

2) NetApp SyncSort Integrated Back Up (NSB) Protection - Per TB 
Qty: 30 Ea
Part Number: 7010
 
3) SharePoint Object Recovery  (SOR) - Per  Content Data Base
Qty: 15 Ea
Part Number: 4650

4) Industrial Funding Fee (IFF)

SYNCSORT is the current database backup solution being used by III MEF, Marine Corps Base, Camp Courtney, Okinawa, Japan.
  If a  backup solution other than SYNCSORT is implemented, the government would incur significant additional costs both monetarily and in the form of highly valuable historical data loss.  Monetary costs would be in the form of purchasing new software, software licenses and training to be proficient in its use.  In addition, all highly valuable historical data that is currently being backed up via SYNCSORT would be lost across 3 different networks because other solutions would not be compatible or be able to read the current historical backups.  Based on the above, a sole source award to SYNCSORT for the acquisition of SYNCSORT NSB Protection Conversion License and SYNCSORT Silver level Support and Service are necessary and in the Governments best interest.

This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations.
  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals or quotations received in response to this notice. 

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, and should furnish detailed data concerning their capabilities to provide the product sought, including pricing data and technical data sufficient enough to determine that a comparable source to the Government is available. The Government will be the sole determiner regarding an offerors ability to meet all requirements. 

The Government will consider all EOIs received prior to 3 days after date of publication of this synopsis before 1200 PST on that date.
  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

EOIs may be submitted via facsimile to Attn: Manabu Mitomi at 011-81-98-970-0969 or by email to manabu.mitomi.ja@usmc.mil .  The facsimile transmission must clearly identify this notice and the name of the contracting officer on the first page.  Submitters bear the burden of ensuring that the EOI reaches the designated contracting officer on time and should allow a reasonable time for facsimile transmissions to be completed.
   All pages of the transmission must reach the office before the deadline specified and pages of a facsimile transmission that arrive in the office after the specified deadline will not be considered.  The submitter bears the risk of non-receipt of facsimile transmissions and should confirm by telephone that any facsimile was received. 

This purchase will be under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1.  The anticipated award date is around 15 Jan 2015. Point of contact for this purchase is Manabu Mitomi and phone number 011-81-98-970-1504.

Synopsis:
The VA NY/NJ Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN3) is in need of "Sani-Hands" requirement.  The requirement is for the "Same or Similar" as the PDI P71520 Sani-Hands Hand Sanitizing Bedside Wipes are effective and easily accessible antimicrobial alcohol hand wipes specifically designed for bedbound patients. The Hand Wipes is needed to provide hand hygiene and assist in reducing the spread of healthcare acquired infections (HAIs) within the medical centers.
The extra-large hand sanitizing wipes contain 65.9 percent alcohol, for recommended hand sanitizing protocol, and aloe and vitamin E are added to moisturize skin. PDI Sani-Hands Bedside Wipes are clinically proven to kill 99.99 percent of bacteria, while moisturizing hands with repeated use. The Personal Hygiene Hand Wipes create friction for optimal hand cleansing. Hands are left clean with no sticky residue. FDA food code compliant, the PDI Hand Sanitizing Wipes are safe to use before eating and drinking.
It is highly recommended that the Sani-Hands have the following, as follows: 
1.	Small resalable package of disinfectant hand wipes for patient use at bedside.
2.	Wipe provides adequate amount of product to be effective
3.	Contains moisturizing agent
4.	Fragrance free
5.	Evidence of effectiveness in clinical trials
The re-sealable P71520 Hand Hygiene Wipe packages are easy to open and contain 20 - 5.5" x 8.4" wipes per package, ideal for an average 3 day hospital stay.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals sanitize their hands regularly throughout the day in order to maintain proper hygiene. If hands are not visibly soiled, an alcohol-based hand rub can be used to clean hands. Sani-Hands Wipes meet this recommendation for use in health care settings.  
 All interested and qualified parties should provide the following information via e-mail to the Contracting Officer by the stated deadline: 

1. Capability Statement 
2. Socio-economic category(s) applicable (i.e. SDVOSB, VOSB, 8a, Hub, WOSB, SB) 
3. The applicable NAICS Code is 423450 
6. Company information including POC info and detailed product information/specs

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Stacey Swader Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4825 Email: stacey.l.swader.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.<br />(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br> (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-15-Q-010033 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the OEM or a fully capable repair vendor. With exception of the Aircraft OEM or Component Production Approval Authority (PAH), a capable repair vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore must be a FAA Certified Repair Facility, and/or an OEM Approved Repair Facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the repair, and be able to certify that final assembly and testing will be conducted at their facility. Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond. This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their repair data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future awards consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide service manuals or OEM service data. In their quote, vendors must provide a reference to the current OEM Manual or Service Reference (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789") that will be used in the overhaul as applicable. Quote must include Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and FOB Point. The HC-144A Aircraft OEM is AIRBUS DEFENSE AND SPACE SAU EADS CASA, AV. DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic repair facility Cage Code is 0DAF1. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical overhaul cost. This is AN UNRESTRICTED SOLICITATION. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. This solicitation is for the repair of HC-144 Aircraft Component/Part(s):

When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-15-Q-010034 is assigned for tracking purposes only.

Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the OEM or a fully capable repair vendor. With exception of the Aircraft OEM or Component Production Approval Authority (PAH), a capable repair vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore must be a FAA Certified Repair Facility, and/or an OEM Approved Repair Facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the repair, and be able to certify that final assembly and testing will be conducted at their facility. Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond.

If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future awards consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide service manuals or OEM service data. In their quote, vendors must provide a reference to the current OEM Manual or Service Reference (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789") that will be used in the overhaul as applicable. Quote must include Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and FOB Point. The PAH for these components is FLIR SYSTEMS INC. Cage Code 64869. The HC-144A Aircraft OEM is AIRBUS DEFENSE AND SPACE SAU EADS CASA, AV. DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic repair facility Cage Code is 0DAF1. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical overhaul cost. This is AN UNRESTRICTED SOLICITATION. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. Items are to be repaired IAW FLIR RELDOC. This solicitation is for the repair of HC-144 Aircraft Component/Part(s):

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>National Museum of the Marine Corps, 18900 Jefferson Davis Highway, Triangle, VA 22172.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for quote submission is: 19 December 2014, 10:00 AM EST. Offers received after this date and time may be considered non-responsive and will not be given further consideration. Please provide all submissions to Government Point of Contact: Teri Bischof, teri.bischof@usmc.mil.</p>
<p>All contractors must comply with the requirement listed above for this request. Failure to comply may result in disqualification. This will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) order.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2. Technical tradeoff will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representation and certifications, and other information required by this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.</p>
<p>The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of requirements, contract terms and conditions, or an unrealistically high or low price when compared to Government estimates, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the program.</p>
<p>Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all quotes. Only those quotes determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the quotes will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price and technical acceptability. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced quote meeting the acceptability standards for the non-priced factors.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARD:</p>
<p>The contractor shall address the following two factors:</p>
<p>1. Factor 1 - Technical Capability - Offeror shall clearly demonstrate its approach to technical ability to meet the requirements of CLIN/Line Items based on meeting the requirements of the Request for Quote, quantity, quality and timeliness of delivery.</p>
<p>2. Factor 2 - Price - The offeror shall complete CLIN pricing on page one (1) of this request. In addition to the completed CLIN pricing on page one (1), the offeror shall provide sufficient price information to allow the Contracting Officer to determine the completeness and reasonableness of the offerors prices.</p>
<p>DISCUSSIONS: If during the evaluation period it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, Offeror responses to clarifications/discussion notices will be considered in making the source selection decision.</p>
<p>AWARD DECISION: The award decisions will be made as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Step One - Determine Technical Acceptability. The technical evaluation, Factor 1, stated above, will assess the offerors capability to satisfy the Government's requirement. The Government will evaluate all technical capability quotes received by the required date/time. The Technical Capability factor will receive a rating of acceptable and unacceptable. If any factor is rated "unacceptable", the entire quote is rendered technically unacceptable, and the quote will be removed from the competitive range. Only quotes deemed technically acceptable (either initially or as the result of discussions) will be considered for award. The ratings are defined in the following table.</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Only those quotes determined acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussion will be considered for award. Once deemed acceptable, all technical quotes are considered to be equal.<br />Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Quotes with an unacceptable rating will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Table A-1</p>
<p>(2) Step Two - Evaluate Price. The offeror's Price quote will be evaluated, for award purposes, based upon the total price proposed as annotated under Factor 2 - Price.</p>
<p>(3) Step Three - Award Decision. Award will be made the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror, subject to a positive responsibility determination in accordance with FAR Part 9 and conformance of the offeror's quote to the terms and conditions of the solicitation.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This is a request for the submission of a quote and does not constitute a contract or authorization to begin work. Nor does an offeror's submission of a quote constitute a contract or authorize the individual or company to being work.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.
As prescribed in 1346.503, insert the following clause: Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract. (b) The place of acceptance will be:NOAA SHIP PISCES GULF MARINE SUPPORT FACILITY 151 WATTS AVENUE PASCAGOULA, MS 39567 <BR> <BR>

Brothers Elizabeth City, NC 27909 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<a href="mailto:sean.g.auld.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>Scope of Work:  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PMFSS) is conducting market research regarding industry's interest and capability in providing up to 250 Expeditionary Solid Waste Disposal Systems (ESWDS). This is not a request for proposal. This notice is only to request information, which may assist the Government in developing future procurement strategies. The ESWDS will improve soldier health and the environment by replacing burn pits by providing a relatively simple, sustainable waste disposal means. The ESWDS shall consist of an incinerator and ancillary equipment integrated and packaged for turn-key use in harsh military applications. The detailed requirements will be in the form of a performance-based specification rather than detailed drawings and specifications. Ahead of production will be a design and development phase during which a vendor or vendors would design and build an ESWDS for qualification testing. Much of the design may include modifying or enhancing a commercial item to create a rugged, expeditionary system suitable for military use, and a system that meets all of the performance requirements below. There are also logistics support requirements associated with ESWDS, including development of military technical manuals and training courses and DVDs. The design of the system shall consider that incinerator loading and operation at an expeditionary camp are not primary tasks for a specifically assigned operator, but rather a shared responsibility among numerous, transient soldiers. Assume soldiers are not of the technical background typically found among licensed incinerator operators. It shall also be assumed maintenance and repair teams are not readily available and may take weeks to respond to system problems.   <br>  <br> Key ESWDS Performance Requirements: <br>  <br> * May be either batch loaded or automated, continuous feed. Shall be reliable and operate for long periods in the absence of maintenance and repair teams. <br> * Shall incinerate up to 1000 pounds per day of mixed, non-hazardous solid waste.  <br> * At least 90 percent volume reduction shall be accomplished for each batch. <br> * Furnish compactors or other devices to minimize the amount of time soldiers must spend loading the incinerator in a given day.   <br> * Shall include a secondary control burn chamber. The detention time and control temperatures of the secondary burn chamber shall provide the best pollution control attainable within the allowable footprint and fuel use limitations of ESWDS.  <br> * When transported to or from the expeditionary site, the entire ESWDS, including its refuse chamber, secondary control chamber, controls, stack, and compactors, shall fit within the footprint of no more than the equivalent of one ISO container of 8'x8'x20'L (e.g., may also use two 10-foot long containers or three 6.6-foot long containers). Skid mounted systems fitting within this size footprint may be considered if they meet all other requirements herein. <br> * The largest material handling equipment available to move and set up the system is a forklift with 10k pounds capacity, and a crane will not be available to set stack.No single container or skid shall weigh more than 10k pounds.   <br> * Fuel supplied will be JP-8 and fuel resupply will be limited to no more than 500 gallons per week.  <br> * Available electric power at a contingency basecamp is either 120-volt single phase, 208-volt single phase or 208-volt three phase. Cables shall be provided to connect ESWDS to the power supply. <br> * Shall be easy to set up, operate, and maintain by soldiers with non-technical skills whose solid waste disposal duties are not a primary responsibility but rather an extra and shared chore. <br> vShall be suitable for use in Army contingency operations such as war time. ESWDS is not for routine use in the U.S., except minimal operation time for system testing and operation and maintenance training. <br> * The ESWDS will not be placed in a separately furnished shelter. Rather the ESWDS shall provide adequate shelter or enclosures for its components and its operators.  ESWDS shall work in extremely cold environments of -25F; extremely hot environments of135F; hot/humid environments; dusty and windy environments; and otherwise inclement weather.   <br> * Shall be durable to withstand transport by air, sea, rail, and ground. Shall remain functional after being subjected to rail impact testing and extensive military road shock testing. <br>  <br> Other requirements: <br>  <br> * Technical publications and manuals shall be developed for operation and maintenance of the ESWDS in accordance with MIL-STD-40051-2B. <br> * Training courses and instructional DVDs shall be developed for operation and maintenance of the ESWDS. <br> * Engineer and design the ESWDS to meet performance specifications and implement configuration control. <br>  <br> Information of interest: <br>  <br> PMFSS appreciates vendors' interest in this notice. The requirements above are preliminary, and responses to this notice may help the Government refine the requirements based on current industry practices. Respondents are therefore encouraged to submit information on their current or past products even if they do not meet the above requirements. For those sources interested in responding, the information is required within 45 calendar days from the publication date of this notice. PMFSS understands some sources may not have all capabilities and experience sought in the notice, and welcomes responses that do not address all items. The following information is requested: 1) Information on existing commercial incinerators that potentially meet the above performance requirements; and how they currently match up against each performance requirement; 2) willingness of the vendor to modify existing systems to meet the above requirements; 3) description of any products that demonstrate the vendor's interest in and capability of integration and containerization of systems; 4) experience designing systems to meet performance specifications and configuration control; 5) experience developing technical manuals and training courses for vendors' products; 6) existing quality assurance program; 7) description of current manufacturing capacity and capability; 8) Vendor's NAICS Code and whether or not vendor is a small business (include number of employees); and 9) recent unit prices of the products presented in the vendor's response. Information shall be limited to fifteen (15) pages or less with no smaller than font size ten (10). If provided electronically, the response needs to be in Microsoft Word 2003, Microsoft Word 2007 or Adobe Acrobat 9 compatible format.

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought (SS)/Request for Information (RFI) for market research.  Information is to be used for preliminary planning purposes in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future.  No solicitation is available nor is there an estimated date of solicitation release at this time.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue an RFP at some future date, another notice will be published.  <br>    <br>   The Product Manager Air Warrior (PM AW) is seeking information and sources with a qualified system capable of providing head tracking as part of a Helmet Display and Tracking System.  The HDTS must interface with the current configuration of the Advanced Sight and Display Computer (ASDC) and Common Display Interface Unit (CDIU).  The Government does not possess a verified and validated Technical Data Package for the Advanced Sight and Display Computer (ASDC) or Common Display Interface Unit (CDIU) as each contains proprietary data the Government is not privy to.  Any responses to this RFI will be used to gather information on systems that may be able to fulfill the PM AW's needs.   <br>  Background:  PM AW is installing the Advanced Sight and Display Computer (ASDC) and Common Display Interface Units (CDIUs) onto Army Aviation Rotary Wing Aircraft as part of an upgrade to update software, provide an ability to interface with new color displays, provide a line of sight capability and to incorporate 3-D symbology.  The 3D flight symbology creates a virtual landing grid and a series of reference towers to improve the pilot's situational awareness (SA) when taking off and landing in the presence of visual obscurants.   The Helmet Display and Tracking System will be integrated onto Army CH-47F and UH-60A/L/M.  PM AW anticipates purchasing hardware that facilitates head position tracking - head tracking units (receivers and transmitters), location devices, etc. that are needed to enable 3-D flight symbology usage.  The tracking information from these components will be used in conjunction with the ASDC and a helmet mounted display to provide 3-D flight symbology to the pilots. PM AW will not purchase displays as part of this effort.  PM AW will continue to use the current ASDC and CDIU configuration as the display data computer.     <br>    PM AW is researching candidate solutions for the following components which currently interface with the ASDC and CDIU to provide line of sight capability:    <br>  -  Advanced Magnetic Transmit Unit (AMTU)   <br>  - Boresight Reticule Unit (BRU) Standard and Mirror  <br>  - Seat Position Sensors   <br>  - Helmet Tracking Kit   <br>  In order to meet the timelines for fielding HDTS, any contractor must have a qualified/or nearly qualified system and meet the following requirements:  <br>  (A)	  Interface with the ASDC and CDIU for data transfer and symbology display.    <br>    <br>  (B)	  Interface with HGU-56P.  Any tracking components requiring helmet mounting must be able to interface with the HGU-56P.  The Army cannot procure or issue a new helmet type into the inventory.  <br>    <br>  (C)	  Meet Airworthiness (safety of flight) qualification and operational requirements in accordance with Attached Table of Requirements.  <br>    <br>  (D)	  Weight of any head tracking components mounted on the helmet shall not exceed 353 grams.  <br>    <br>  (E)	  Weight of aircraft mounted equipment shall not exceed 6.6 lbs.    <br>    <br>  (F)	  Operate using power supplied by the ASDC.   <br>    <br>  (G)	  All wiring and electrical practices shall be IAW SAE-AS50881D.  <br>    <br>  This effort would be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract utilizing Firm-Fixed Price delivery order for production of the Helmet Display and Tracking System (HDTS).  <br>    <br>  RESPONSES:  All interested parties should submit a written response to this SS/RFI.

<p>Competition is not feasible since CenturyLink, as the current multi-strand fiber cable and facility owner, has complete control and access to the single fiber strand leased by the Government. Since procurement of the IRU in 1999, the Government has provided equipment and due to technology advances, this equipment becomes obsolete from time to time and, therefore, requires replacement in order to meet DOD communication mission needs. The location of the equipment is within CenturyLink-owned facilities; thus, there is only one source able to perform this effort and provide essential services to the Government. Using other fiber providers would require access into CenturyLink's facilities or would cause additional cost to the Government for a new fiber network. Additionally, transitioning to another contractor's network would require up to a year to complete and would not meet the mission in the time required. CenturyLink has the experience, resources, technical expertise, and security qualifications required to complete the work at the lowest cost to the Government and in the timeframe required.<br />(16) Description<br />The U.S. Government has a mission critical telecommunications Network Enhancement requirement described herein to upgrade the existing Information System Network (DISN) CORE 10G Corestream optical transport networks to 100G 6500 Packet - Over Transport Network (P-OTN) for the enhancement of all current amplifiers, regenerators, and other equipment on Government Indefeasible Right of Use (IRU) fibers between the following CONUS locations: Kelly AFB, TX, Bacon Ridge, TX, Kirtland AFB, NM, FT. Carson, CO and Buckley AFB CO.<br />(17) Place of Contract Performance - Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado<br />(18) Set-aside Status - None.<br />(19) Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within thirty days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Risk MAP combines Flood Hazard Mapping, Risk Assessment Tools, and Hazard Mitigation Planning into one program. This integrated program encourages beneficial partnerships and innovative uses of flood<br />hazard and risk assessment data in order to build more resilient communities. While flooding is the primary focus of Risk MAP, FEMA actively encourages a Whole-Community approach, and is focused on enhancing the usability and value of natural hazard risk information, leading to an increase in the<br />public's awareness of risk, and communities taking mitigative actions to reduce the risk to life and property, increasing resilience so they may withstand, adapt, and recover from disasters.<br /><br />In addition, FEMA operates HMTAP under the authorities of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended, PL 93-299 and the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.&nbsp; Assistance is provided to aid headquarters, its regional counterparts, and field offices to meet post-disaster mitigation responsibilities.&nbsp; FEMA also operates TARC to bring together engineers, architects, design professionals, natural hazard experts and the building science community to conduct studies and activities focused on flood, wind, hurricane, tornado and other hazard mitigation, building codes and standards, technical assessments, rapid post-disaster building performance studies and analysis to create nationally applicable FEMA publications, tools, training and education for use by emergency managers and the building community, across the nation.<br /><br />

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
     553-15-1-101-0803	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$14,700.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:


 Payment for missing 196 CY-OX-USPEA Cylinders at the John D. Dingell VAMC, 4646 John R. Street, Detroit, MI 48201. 



3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  
 The John D. Dingell VAMC's previous Airgas Contracts included Demurrage charges, and the tanks were the responsibility of the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center. The charges for the missing tanks can only be paid to Airgas, LLC. 



4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  

 The John D. Dingell VAMC's previous Airgas Contracts included Demurrage charges. A recent audit conducted jointly by Airgas and the John D. Dingell VAMC showed 196 ea missing CY-OX USPEA cylinders. 


5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Market Research was conducted and a special notice posted with negative response.

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC><p>BPA: HSCEC7-09-A-00002 was awarded on July 17, 2009, with a performance start date of August 1, 2009 for PSO services throughout the State of New Mexico. The current BPA Ordering Period, Ordering Period IV, was set to expire on September 30, 2014. This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program in accordance with FAR 8.405-6, "Limited sources justification and approval." The proposed 4-month BPA extension is to acquire continued PSO services from October 1, 2014 through January 31, 205 at an approximate value of $2,378,098.21. In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), the circumstance restricting competition for this acquisition is there is only one source capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Protective Service (FPS) has a requirement to secure on a limited source basis continued Protective Security Officer (PSO) services at various locations throughout the state of New Mexico until award of a competitive follow-on contract is made and completed.</p>
<p>The four month period shall allow the Government the necessary time to conduct discussions, adequately document its source selection, issue the award and allow for the 90-day transition. This LSJ is to acquire continued POS Services from J. Diamond Group, Inc.</p>
