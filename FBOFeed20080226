<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&D) proposals in the area of Spin-Torque Transfer Random Access Memory technologies. The goal of this program is to develop materials and processes to fully exploit the spin-torque transfer (STT) phenomenon for creating "universal" memory elements.  A universal memory element is one that exhibits scalability for high capacity of storage per unit volume, as well as high read/write speed, compatibility with CMOS processes, and non-volatility.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  

Prior research in micro-magnetics and spintronics has led to the exploitation of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effects for rotating magnetic disk drive memories, as well as magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJ) for magnetic random access memory (MRAM).  The spin-torque transfer (STT) effect is a recent discovery that exploits magnetic spin states to electrically change the magnetic orientation of a material (Science 285, 867 (1999)).  Components based on the STT effect can have the properties of a universal memory, high density, high speed, non-volatility, high endurance, and can also be well suited for harsh environments such as those with exposure to ionizing radiation.  In addition, they can operate from a single power supply voltage level greatly simplifying associated circuitry.

This program is aimed at developing the core technology for exploiting spin-torque transfer and related phenomena for producing large-scale memories.  Compatibility and stability with expected mainstream processes for semiconductor electronics and patterned media is an important attribute that should enable significant leverage for these new technologies in delivering early demonstrations and in gaining wider acceptance.

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to BAA08-16@darpa.mil. 

Full BAA is attached.

<DESC>The United States Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center, is pursing a sole source contract with LMK Engineers, LLC (LMK), 72 Robinson St, Pottstown, PA pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-5(b)(5), Authorized by the HUBZone Act of 1997, 15 U.S.C. ýý 657a. LMK is a HUBZone Small Business Concern. The proposed contract will be for an eighteen (18) month period of performance beginning on or about March 19, 2008. DOE intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source and no other sources will be considered. This notice satisfies the requirements of FAR Part 5. The contract is for specialized technical services necessary to support acquisition of  the follow-on Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride (DUF6) Operations contract. Tasks will consist of research, review and writing of specifications; defining technical requirements in development of statement of work; proposal evaluation services; assistance in the construction of government cost models for various activities; as well as other performance requirements. Primarily, the contractor will assist federal staff in identifying and defining the technical requirements needed to construct an adequate Statement of Work (SOW) and to evaluate proposals for the follow-on acquisition to obtain a contractor to operate the DUF6 facilities to convert the DOE inventory of DUF6 to a stable chemical form acceptable for transportation, beneficial use/reuse, and/or disposal. Substantial knowledge of DUF6 conversion facilities and processes will be essential to performing these tasks; LMK obtained this expertise while providing DOE oversight services for the DUF6 project and is the only known organization, other than the conversion contractor, to have sufficient expertise. The DUF6 conversion facilities employ a new and unique design with one of the key processing steps utilizing proprietary technology. Moreover, the contractor involved in providing these services would be precluded from competing under the SOW to be the DOE DUF6 conversion contractor. Because of the unique nature of the process and its design operating parameters, it is not reasonable for DOE to expect any other contractor, to have the substantial requisite expertise to advise DOE on this process. Time is of the essence in obtaining a follow-on DUF6 operations contractor so DOE cannot delay this contract while other concerns obtain this expertise. The value of this effort is estimated to be under $550,000.

<DESC>The Naval Reactors Laboratory Field Office in conjunction with the Naval Sea  System Command is seeking offers for management and operation of the  Bettis  Atomic Power Laboratory, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania and the Knolls Atomic  Power  Laboratory, Schenectady, New York.  Both laboratories currently provide  broad  support for the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program in the design,  development,  improvement, maintenance and training for operation of naval nuclear  propulsion  plants.  The mission of the two laboratories will not change under the  proposed  new contract.  The Department of Energy and the Department of the Navy  plan to  issue a joint solicitation which will result in award of two contracts to  a  single offeror, a Department of Energy contract for management and  operation of  the laboratories, and a Department of the Navy contract for design,  development, improvement, maintenance and training for operation of naval  nuclear propulsion plants.  Interested parties must meet the following  minimum  requirements:  (1) ability to obtain a DOE or equivalent U.S. Government  agency  facility security clearance; (2) agree to offer employment to all current  personnel at the same base salary/pay rates being paid at the time of  offer of  employment and the same benefit package; (3) strictly comply with  organization  conflict of interest provisions of the Request of Proposal (RFP) which are  governed by the policies and procedures in Subpart 9.5 (Organizational and  Consultant Conflicts of Interest) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation as  implemented in DOE Acquisition Regulation 952.209-72 with Alternate; (4)  accept  without deviation all Federal Acquisition Regulation, Department of Energy  Acquisition Regulation, and Department of Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation provisions of the RFP; and (5) submit responsive proposals for  both  the NAVSEA and DOE requirements.

Further, the Government prefers that management responsibility  remain  with the General Manager positions at Bettis and KAPL and that corporate  involvement in operations be limited to that necessary to satisfy  corporate  fiduciary duties. To promote the use of small business under the anticipated contract,  offerors  will be evaluated on their level of commitment to meeting the agencyýýýs  small  business goals which are 46% for total small business concerns, 5% small  disadvantaged business concerns, 5% women-owned small business concerns,  3%  HUB-Zone small business concerns,   3% service-disabled veteran-owned  small  business concerns.  The successful offeror will be required to pursue  development of at least one 8(a) mentor/protýýgýý program.

<ARCHDATE>02252009
<CONTACT>Wayne Leong Contracting Officer 2023665620     wayne.leong@dot.gov;
<DESC>The Maritime Administration intends to award a contract for continued project management service of the Port of Anchorage Intermodal Expansion Project to Integrated Concept & Research Corporation, located in Anchorage AK, on a Sole Source basis.  The anticipated award date is in May 2008, for one year with four one-year options. Integrated Concepts and Research Corporation (ICRC), a subsidiary of Koniag Development Corporation has been the project manager since November 2003, under the Small Business Administration's Alaskan Native Corporation program.  In June, 2007, ICRC ws purchased by VSE, a large business.  Under Federal Acquisition Regulations 19.812(d), the 8(a) contract must be terminated, absent a waiver from the SBA.  In January 2008, the SBA declined to issue such a waiver. Since inception of the program, ICRC has managed all aspects of the project, developing expert knowledge of the project and forging key relationships with State, local, Federal agencies, and the local contractor community.  ICRC has the expertise, and established business relationships to manage a major construction project in a challenging environment such as Anchorage, with critical economic implications for the entire state of Alaska and strategic port implications for the nation's security. Changing prime contractors at this stage would present a significant and unacceptable setback to the project's progression, and would be contrary to the public interest. The integrated master schedule and budget and overall complex project implementation has been developed by ICRC after four years of research, lengthy negotiations, and frequent communications with all project stakeholders.  ICRC has compiled substantial background information related to the project and developed internal controls to maintain the voluminous materials which describe the existing baseline and as-built conditions which are integral in establishing the phased implementation of the project.  In addition, ICRC has also established procedures and controls necessary to maintaining progress on a multiplicity of contracts, subcontracts, tribal arrangements and payments for commercially awarded contract instruments. In addition, ICRC has been an integral part of attaining all required permits for the project including negotiations of permit conditions, permit modifications, preparation and maintenance of compliance documents, and all public involvement including multi-agency meetings with those having jurisdiction over multiple trust resources.  ICRC maintains a database of open permits, and evidence of project permit compliance, for approximately 100 mandates at the local, State, and Federal regulatory levels.  ICRC remains integral to the development and implementation of an interagency approved compensatory Mitigation Plan for the project.  In addition, ICRC staff possesses the innate project knowledge, background, and experience and is relied upon heavily by the Maritime Administration and Port Of Anchorage on a daily basis.  ICRC's staff has substantial institutional and historical knowledge necessary to move the project forward efficiently and effectively. ICRC is instrumental in continuing the complex relationships and has intimate knowledge of all binding agreements between Maritime Administration and the U.S. Air Force, Elmendorf AFB (EAFB) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  These agreements establish unique partnerships that allow the majority of earth materials required for the project to be excavated on EAFB, transported to the port without the use of public roads, at no royalty cost to the Government, through a unique partnership.  The working relationships and trust required to achieve and maintain these agreements represent a significant investment on the part of ICRC and the Government and could not be replaced even at significant cost and time.

FOR STANLEY VIDMAR STORAGE CABINETS

I.	CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION:  The contracting organization responsible for this action is the 4th Contracting Squadron, 1695 Wright Brothers Avenue, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC 27531.

II.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: The action required is a Brand Name Fixed Price Contract to purchase a Stanley Vidmar Storage System.  The system is required to provide safe and secure storage of bench stock and other small assets.

III.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The system will be used to support an expected increase in stocked assets in 4 LRS F-15E Aircraft Parts Store (APS).  The request is for Stanley Vidmar modular cabinets of different quantity to include installation.

IV.	AUTHORITY:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and 6.302-1(c).

V.	APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  The current storage system in place at the APS is a Stanley Vidmar System and the add-on system is specific to this system.  There are no other storage systems in the market that are compatible.

VI.	EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  Contractors with similar GSA schedules were contacted (Core Services, Inc., Techni-tool, Inc., A S Custom Furniture Company, and Plug-in Storage Systems, Inc.) revealing that they could not fulfill this requirement. Contacted Stanley Vidmar storage system distributors Miller Industrial, Adams Handling and Dillion Supply and they are interested and capable.

       VII.   FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  The anticipated cost is being determined fair and reasonable in accordance with market research.

               more compact system.  The additional Vidmar storage cabinets will increase the APS 
               storage capacity by 30% and will allow the extra floor space to be used for heavier, bulk
               type assets.
     
       X.   TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION:  The using activity 
              has certified that the technical requirements and certifications are complete and accurate.

<ARCHDATE>04102008
<CONTACT>MERLINDA M. LABACO 619-532-8122
<DESC>The Alter-G treadmill is covered and surrounded by an inflatable bag. The top center of the bag has a hole through which the exercising subject steps onto the treadmill surface. Before entering the machine, the user puts on a special pair of athletic shorts. They step through the hole in the inflatable bag and zip the waist band of the shorts into the top of the bag. The shorts create an air-tight, flexible seal around the torso of the subject A touch screen control panel allows the user to choose a body weight at which to exercise. They can choose to reduce their effective body weight by as much as 80% (in as small as 1 % increments). For example, a 200 pound individual could exercise at an effective weight as low as 40 pounds. When a reduction in body weight is selected, the G- Trainer increases the pressure in the bag in proportion to the desired reduction in weight. This increases the lifting force on the subject and effectively reduces their body weight on the treadmill surface. It takes very little pressure in the bag to produce a substantial lifting force. Because the bag pressure is small and distributed over a large surface area, the exercising individual feels very little force on their body. The comfort and natural gait while exercising makes the G- Trainer unique among un-weighting devices and confers a significant advantage over competitive systems. PERFORMANCE . User weight capacity: 400 pounds (227 kg) . Effective Body Weight Range Adjustment: 20% - 100% of user's body weight; 1 % increments in body weight .

<DESC>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  THERE IS NO SEPARATE RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD. Engineering and design services for an indefinite quantity contract for civil/structural/waterfront services. The preponderance of the work under these contracts is anticipated to occur within the NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic Northeast IPT area of responsibility including the states of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont. Work could also be added in any other area of responsibility of NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic or NAVFAC Washington, D.C. including the District of Columbia and the states of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia.  Work will include engineering services for the study and design of new construction, repair, alteration and improvement for (1) waterfront (piers, wharves, quaywalls, drydocks, bulkheads, crane rail systems, fender systems, condition reports and underwater inspection, dredging design and waterfront related utilities) (2) civil (airfields, roads, parking areas, railro!  ads, utility systems including sanitary and storm, wastewater treatment plants, water systems, storm water management, sediment and erosion control, and earthwork retaining walls) (3) structural (buildings, building renovations, bridges, other industrial structures, failure investigation including destructive and non-destructive testing, seismic design, progressive collapse analysis, foundation design and blast resistant design), (4) associated electrical, mechanical, and fire protection engineering and architectural services.

The initial project will be determined at a later date.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command is presently using Design-Build as the preferred method for acquiring capital improvements.  Though Design-Bid-Build methodologies (with the preparation of 100% Plans and Specifications) will continue to be utilized, a significant number will likely require preparation of Requests for Proposal packages for Design-Build solicitations using abbreviated (0% - 30%) design documentation.  Packages would include elements of site/engineering investigation, architectural programming, and function/performance specifications.  Phases and/or pre-priced contract options may be included and will be ex!  ercised at the discretion of the government for 0 to 35%, 35 to 100% design, and post construction contract award services.  Contract award is contingent on availability of funds.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  Some projects will require design in the metric system.  As part of this contract, an asbestos and/or lead-based paint assessment may be required to determine the presence of hazardous material during removals/demolition or at utility points of connections.  Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead paint, PCBs, and other hazardous materials.  Work will be prepared utilizing AutoCAD 2006 or higher.  Specifications will be prepared using SPECINSTACT SGML program, and cost estimates using the Success estimating program in a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) system format will be utilized.  Selected firm will be required to provide documents in pdf format!   for posting to a Government web site during solicitation. Firms are advised that the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates which design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or request for proposals for Design-Build projects, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost. The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to email via the Internet for exchange of correspondence/information. SIGNIFICANT EVALUATION FACTORS (in order of importance): 1. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE.

<DESC>The NASA/SSC Acquisition Management Office intends to issue a Best Value Request for Proposal (RFP) for the project entitled ?Fabrication, inspection, testing, and delivery of Chemical Steam Generators for A-3 Altitude Test Stand? to be delivered to the John C. Stennis Space Center, Mississippi.  The work to be performed under this requirement consists of providing all labor, equipment, and materials necessary for the fabrication, inspection, testing, and delivery of twenty-seven (27) Chemical Steam Generators (CSGs) to Stennis Space Center Building 2204.    The CSGs required are a design that was produced for White Sands Test Facility in the 1960?s that is a proven design.  The most similar component to these CSG?s is a small regeneratively cooled rocket combustion chamber or gas generator.  The concept is basically a small combustion chamber similar to a rocket engine combustion chamber that burns isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and oxygen with a water diluent to produce the steam.  This project will require detailed machining, pipe modification and welding, plate steel forming and welding, detailed welding including some thin wall sheet metal welding.

<ARCHDATE>02252009
<CONTACT>Sarah J. Welch Contract Specialist 3608547220     Sarah_Welch@nps.gov;
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This contract is for excavation, data recovery, and documentation of archeological site 45WH241 on Ross Lake during reservoir drawdown, approximately late April through early June, 2008.  The site is located on an alluvial fan surface some distance from the (pre-reservoir) Skagit River channel and is a large, open, pre-contact period lithic scatter radiocarbon-dated between 1900 and 1500 years old.  The site's annual exposure to reservoir shoreline erosion processes may have altered site conditions since original field testing in 1989-1990.  No pre-contact period human burials, gravesites, ceremonial features, or sacred objects have been recorded or reported at the project area or within the park boundaries.  The historic gravesite of John McMillan is located far to the south of this project area. The contractor shall employ standard methods for surface mapping of artifacts, site mapping, excavation of shovel or test probes, excavation of stratigraphy trenches and pits, and full-scale excavation using 1x1 and 2x2 m square excavation units, as needed to perform data recovery.   The contractor shall employ standard laboratory and analytic techniques to describe, identify, and classify archeological collections, as well as prepare an inventory of all artifacts recovered from excavation units, to include their provenience, class or artifact category, age assessment, and context (in situ or disturbed).  The contractor shall prepare a report describing laboratory methods, field methods, and their results, along with archeological interpretations of the data that address issues and objectives of the research design.   The contractor is strongly encouraged to seek qualified field workers among members of the three Skagit River tribes, to the extent possible.  At the contractor's request, NPS staff will provide contact information for each of the tribes, which include the Sauk-Suiattle, Swinomish, and Upper Skagit.   LOCATION:  The project area is located within the drawdown zone at the southern end of Ross Lake near Roland Point backcountry campsite, eastern Whatcom County, Washington, on lands managed by the National Park Service.  It is comprised of the exposed and devegetated reservoir bottom lands ("drawdown zone"), where reservoir sediments and eroded soils are exposed to air for a short time each year.  Directions to the site will be provided in the RFQ, but be advised there is no direct road or trail access to this site.  Information about Ross Lake may be found at http://www.nps.gov/archive/noca/rola/rosslake.htm SOLICITATION DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement open to small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this project is 541720 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  The electronic Request for Quotations will be available on approximately March 10, 2008, at www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov. In order to download the solicitation, interested vendors must register at  http://ideasec.nbc.gov and maintain an active registration at http://www.ccr.gov.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

The National Cancer Institute investigators require advanced light microscopy instrumentation.  Investigators have demonstrated a need for performing long-term time-lapse microscopy on living specimens.  The proposed Zeiss LSM 5 Live Duo-scan will enable a whole new class of microscopy experiments that were heretofore impossible in the NCI confocal core.  Many cellular processes occur over slow time scales of up to a day.  These processes can only be studied in live cells using long-term time lapse microscopy.  The Zeiss LSM 5 Live Duo-scan system will allow confocal imaging of specimens over these extended time periods, while keeping the specimen alive and healthy throughout the experiment.  In addition, autofocus software available with this instrument will overcome problems with specimen drift and keep the cell of interest in focus throughout these long time lapse studies.  This eliminates the need for users to keep a constant watch over the specimen throughout the 24 hour experiment.

Description of the instrument required:  As the instrument will be applied to long term studies of live cells, it must be capable of rapid acquisition of specimens at very low light levels.   This will make it suitable for examining fast processes in specimens without damaging the cells during image acquisition.  The system should also include an enclosed incubation chamber permitting long term observation of specimens at controlled temperatures and CO2 levels. An auto-focusing procedure is essential to maintain a constant focus on cells over long term time lapse imaging. In addition, laser lines should be available for fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP).  

The Zeiss 5 Live has several unique features that are essential for research in the LRBGE facility.  These features are not found on any other commercial microscope.  The ability of this instrument to collect single and dual channel images at greater than 120 frames / sec is vital to the FRAP experiments that are being conducted in the facility.  FRAP recoveries are extremely rapid, and this system will enable us to collect very high time resolution data during the recovery.  A second unique feature of the Zeiss 5 Live is that it is equipped with a high speed piezo that permits capture of more than 20 images per second.  This feature is also vital for our FRAP experiments since we must collect 3D stacks as rapidly as possible to track the object that has been photobleached which often moves out of the original focal plane.  A final unique feature of the Zeiss 5 Live required for our work is its ability to rapidly image while simultaneously photobleaching with manipulators.  This feature will allow us to obtain images as the photobleach is performed, thereby providing the shortest possible time lag between the photobleach and the recovery data.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 11:00 AM ET on March 7, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference: NCI-80040-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The CECOM Acquisition Center  Washington will be issuing a Request for Proposal using Full and Open Competition on behalf the US Army Night Vision Electronic Sensors Directorate, Countermine Division, Humanitarian Demining Branch for a non-developme ntal Ground Engaging Milling/Tilling/Grinding System (GEMS).  The resulting contract will require the contractor to build, test, document, and deliver one non-developmental, field ready, non-flail, mechanical mine clearing system that can detonate and/or d estroy antitank (AT) and antipersonnel (AP) landmines, hereafter referred to as the GEMS.  The GEMS shall have the capabilities to neutralize both AT and AP landmines by way of physical destruction and/or detonation employing a ground engaging grinding/til ling/milling type technology.  Following a blast equivalent of up to and including 7kg TNT under the implement the GEMS shall be field repairable within 24 hours while working in field conditions.  The system must be field repairable using on board basic t ools.  Welding and fabrication is acceptable but should be kept to a minimum.  The system shall not be flail based.  Systems utilizing flails to engage the ground and targets will not be considered for this effort. Flail based technology is defined as tech nology that utilizes hammers attached by chains or cables to a rotating drum to beat the earth.  The technology must be mature and have a technology readiness level (TRL) of 7 or higher.  TRL 7 definition: System prototype demonstrated in an operational en vironment.  GEMS shall have an effective clearance depth of no less than 25 centimeters from the ground surface.  This depth must be obtained in a single pass from the system.  All landmines buried to a depth of 25 centimeters shall be neutralized by break ing or detonation.  The system shall be capable of maintaining the effective depth of 25 centimeters at all times during operations over uneven rough terrain to ensure that all ground to a depth of at least 25 centimeters has been processed and no gaps in operation have been left.  The technology must have an effective clearance width of no less than 2 meters per pass.  Effective clearance width is the width of the working implement. The vehicle chassis shall be less than the width of the working tool to en sure the chassis is always in cleared ground.  It must be able to obtain a clearance rate of 1250 square meters per hour or better while working in medium to soft soils with vegetation ranging from 3 cm or less in diameter.  The operators cab must provide  protection to the occupants.  The system shall have a level of protection sufficient to protect the occupants of the cab from injury in the event of a 7kg TNT equivalent blast.  The system may be remotely operated negating the need for occupant safety. If  the GEMS is remote controlled the system must be capable of operating in varying terrain to a minimum distance of 500 meters. The remote control system must provide sufficient controls to effectively perform the desired clearance mission.  The physical di mensions and weight of the system must not exceed those that would allow the system to fit within one standard 20ft ISO shipping container.  The system must be able to do so without any disassembly of the major components of the system.  The only disassemb ly permitted would be if the milling/tilling/grinding head was removable then it may be removed for packing into the 20ft ISO container.  Both the head and base machine must still fit within one 20ft ISO container while disassembled; the systems must be op erational within 60 minutes if reassembly is required. Spare parts and additional attachments are not included in this requirement and can be packaged and shipped in additional containers as required.   <BR>The Contractor shall also provide training materi als, training, and system support package.  The GEMS shall be capable of engaging the ground with a milling/tilling type technology to physically detonate or de stroy the landmine without incurring major repairs to the system.  The operational concept is to be able to operate through a mine field of mixed AP and AT landmines and render the area safe for civilian use post process of all suspected ground.  The contr actor will be required to support a Government test at a US east coast destination.  The contract will also include an optional requirement for 12 months of logistical support for an Operational Field Evaluation (OFE) in Mozambique.  This optional support shall include a system support package sufficient to perform maintenance and system repairs for the 12 month period and on-site support of system repairs and maintenance.  The period of performance for this effort is 18 months with an optional 18 month per iod (6 months for Government system movement OCONUS and 12 months for contractor support).  The RFP will solicit proposals for a Firm Fixed Price system and Cost Plus Fixed Fee support.   The RFP will be posted at the C-E LCMC Interactive Business Opportun ity Page (IBOP) https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/. Interested parties will be required to register at the website prior to accessing the documents.  The RFP will be posted under Army Pre-award, C-E LCMC-2007.  It is expected that the RFP will be posted on or  about 25 March 2008.  Potential Offerors should continue to monitor the IBOP for RFP posting and any further updates.

<DESC>The US Forest Service is soliciting the following serivces for performance in the Carson and Bridgeport Ranger Districts of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.  The solicitation will be a Request for Proposals, which will be published here on or before 2/25/08.  Full original technical and pricing proposals will be due to the Contracting Officer, and a copy of the Technical Proposal only, (no pricing) will be due to the Carson Ranger District, all no later than close of business on 3/25/08.  

Services Sought:

1. Tree planting services to restore and reforest lands burned over after wildfire.  The purpose of this contract is to secure containerized tree planting services in a manner that insures tree survival and growth.  Tree survival and growth is dependant on the initial health of the tree seedlings, the manner in which trees are handled and planted, environmental conditions such as soil moisture and weather, and animal damage to the seedlings. The services secured with this contract will focus on the need to provide appropriate tree handling, care, and planting techniques during a period of time when environmental conditions are most favorable to insure tree survival.  The installation of shade tubes is included in this contract.

2. Pre-commercial tree thinning and stand improvement activities to reduce tree densities and, by the deliberate selection of leave trees, improve the overall health and condition of the stand based on the prescribed objectives.  Tree selection and cutting of undesirable or excess trees will provide space for the leave trees to grow and develop, reduce the incidence of insect and diseases that affect growth, and undesirable tree qualities.  The goal of this project is to thin dense stands of Jeffrey Pine regeneration and release the leave trees from brush competition.  Aspen stands recovering after a wild land fire will also be enhanced by removing conifers from within and around the stand, allowing the aspen sprouts to increase in number, size and acreage.   In some areas brush reduction activities will be used to reduce fire danger.

The Forest Service anticipates the award of a Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, (IDIQ) Contract to a single awardee.  The Forest Service reserves the right to award to multiple awardees if it desires, but is not bound to do so, and it is not the initial intent.

<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey, Geologic Division, has a requirement to conduct specialized geologic and geophysical analyses of cores and well logs that were collected during the 2006 National Gas Hydrate Research Program (NGHP) Indian Ocean Expedition 01.  Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University participated in the USGS managed NGHP Expedition 01 during the summer 2006.  Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory was responsible for managing and carrying out the downhole logging component of the program.  The USGS now requires specialized study of the well logs and integration of the log and core data with both the site survey and regional seismic data to better understand the geologic setting and history of Site NGHP-01-17.  As part of the field effort under NGHP Expedition 01, downhole logging data was acquired at all sites which is presently archived and being analyzed at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory.  The USGS has a need for Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory to integrate the logging data as well as sedimentologic and paleontology information from the cores with the local site survey seismic reflection grid and with regional seismic and geophysical data to obtain an understanding of the tectonic and sedimentologic setting and geologic history of the site.  No other group has access to the required NGHP well log data, the site survey MCS seismic data and the other regional seismic data that has been assembled from Indian and U.S. sources.  This unique combination of data is necessary for the successful completion of the required study.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, NY 10964, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice to the procurement.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  The NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.  The NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSA's use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSA's evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Notice, the NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  However, should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.  

More than one million motor vehicle thefts occur annually in the United States (U.S.), causing lost of mobility and economic impact to those affected.  In the U.S., two vehicles are stolen every minute and vehicle theft remains the nation's number one property crime, costing an estimated $7.6 billion each year.  Vehicle theft is also a global epidemic.  It is estimated that the global cost of motor vehicle theft is approximately $20.5 billion. 

The Congress enacted the Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act in 1984 (the 1984 Theft Act) as a measure to reduce the growing problem of motor vehicle theft in the 1980's.  It added Title VI to the Motor Vehicle and Information Cost Savings Act (re-codified as Chapter 331 of Title 49, United States Code).  The purpose of the 1984 Theft Act was to help reduce motor vehicle thefts and to provide a tool for law enforcement to trace and recover stolen motor vehicles and vehicle parts while minimizing the cost increase to the consumer.

Under the provision of the 1984 Theft Act, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published the regulation entitled "Exemption from the Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard", 49 CFR Part 543.  The 1984 Theft Act intended to encourage manufacturers to use anti-theft devices which could act as a further theft deterrent.  49 CFR Part 543 allows a manufacturer to petition the agency for an exemption from the parts-marking requirements of the theft standard of a vehicle line when it plans to install an anti-theft device as standard equipment on the entire line.  The agency may approve the exemption if it determines that the anti-theft device is likely to be as effective as parts-marking in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft. 

The following is a summary of major events in the theft prevention regulatory history:

On October 24, 1985, NHTSA published the Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, 49 CFR Part 541.  The purpose of this standard is to reduce motor vehicle theft by assisting law enforcement authorities trace and recover the parts from stolen vehicles.  

This standard became effective beginning with the 1987 model year and required that selected high theft car lines have 12 (two door models) or 14 (four door models) of its major component parts-marked with the V.I.N.  Each vehicle in a high theft line must have its major parts and major replacement parts-marked unless the vehicle line is granted an exemption from the parts marking requirements. 

As a result of an increase in motor vehicle thefts and associated crimes, the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 (the 1992 Theft Act), was created.  The 1992 Theft Act amended the Theft Prevention Standard by extending the Federal parts-marking requirements to include light-duty trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles (with a GVWR of 6,000 pounds or less).  On December 13, 1994, the final rule amending the Theft Prevention Standard was published.  This December 1994 rulemaking extended the parts-marking requirements:  (a) to include multipurpose passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks; (b) listed the major component parts and replacement parts to be marked for each of the classes of vehicles such as the engine, transmission, front/rear bumper, right/left front fender, hood, right/left front door, right/left rear door, sliding or cargo door(s), right/left quarter panel (passenger cars), right/left side assembly (MPVs), pickup box, and/or cargo box (light duty trucks), rear doors, decklid or hatchback and tailgate; and (c) established a new median theft rate (3.5826) for all passenger motor vehicles.  This amendment became effective beginning with MY 1997 vehicles.

On April 6, 2004, NHTSA published a Final Rule extending the anti-theft parts-marking requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, CFR Part 541.  This regulation expands NHTSA?s current anti-theft parts marking requirement to include: (1) all below median theft rate passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles (with a gross vehicle weight rating of 6,000 pounds or less), and (2) below median theft rate light-duty trucks with major parts that are interchangeable with passenger motor vehicles subject to parts-marking. This Final Rule was effective beginning September 1, 2006. 

On May 19, 2005, NHTSA published a Final Rule responding to petitions for reconsideration of the new rule extending the anti-theft parts-marking requirements.  This Final  Rule made the following changes and clarifications to the agency?s expanded parts-marking requirements:  (1) manufacturers are no longer required to submit likely theft rate determinations for vehicle lines introduced prior to the September 1, 2006, effective date, if the manufacturers choose to voluntarily mark the new vehicle lines immediately after their introduction; (2) manufacturers are permitted to petition the agency to exempt low-theft vehicle lines equipped with antitheft devices from the parts marking requirements beginning with model year 2006; (3) vehicle lines with annual production of not more than 3,500 vehicles are excluded from the parts-marking requirements; and (4) the agency adopted a phase-in of the new parts-marking requirements over a two-year period.

Based on a recent analysis report by NHTSA's Consumer Standards Division, although improvements have been made in motor vehicle theft prevention, vehicle theft remains a persistent problem in the U.S.  The analysis report concluded that there is still work to be done and more focused research is needed to effectively evaluate the downward trend in vehicle theft rates.  

The main objective of the project is to evaluate the contribution of parts-marking and anti-theft devices to vehicle theft prevention and the downward trend of vehicle theft rates, through research and analysis of each technology.  Research and analysis should be conducted on the available technologies, the effectiveness of each, relationship of auto-theft to public safety, and cost analysis.  The contractor should draw on many sources of information, such as vehicle manufacturers, parts-marking label and anti-theft device manufacturers, law enforcement, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Department of Justice (DOJ), Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), insurance companies, public and any other sources.

Format of Corporate Capabilities Statement:

Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the firm's ability and interest in no more than 10 pages to perform the key requirements described above.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, e.g., Large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response. Interested offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Notice no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting. E-mail is the preferred method when receiving responses to this Notice.

<DESC>A.	General Information. <BR><BR>     The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisia na, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Wipes. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this prog ram is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through th e DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fo rt Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort  Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>     T his standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreemen t (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a su pplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performa nce evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a  combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) is seeking product line items in the category of Wipes, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines be low.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $190,773.47.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:   Di sposable Wipes Large (tub) $41,230.42; Baby Wipes $23,597.94; Dry Wipes $21,008.79.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region (6, 7 & 8) MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools fo r clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>INTEREST ED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM CST ON 18 March 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide hard copy responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of ele ctronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for mail to be lost, vendors must confirm with the Regional POC stated below that their submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Busi ness Office (TRBO).  Each submitting vendor will confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>Responses should be sent via your preferred delivery carrier with a  requested return receipt and/or tracking number to Ms. Sarah Allen, Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.

After the review of the technical/company cr iteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this sect ion demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor  has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for a ll products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendo r from further consideration.<BR><BR> Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will validate/approve the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute  a complete product line of Wipes.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined  in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  At a minimum, this includes: Disposable Wipes and Baby Wipes. Provide certification of all brands of this prod uct line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal. <BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Wipes product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the in itial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor, Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disquali fied.)<BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified). Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are r equired by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, FSS prices do not represent discounts off the DAPA.<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy pricing quotes and a competitive product cross-reference in the prescribed electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  Al l communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed. <BR>6.	Vendor must provide educational tools and materials for Wipes as well as no cost samples for the evaluation.   Describe your available company educational tools and material resources with the initial submittal.    <BR>7.	Vendor must provide customer service via telephonic, onsite, website or email for regional facilities.  Identify company resources and capabili ties for such support with the initial submittal. <BR>8.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>9.	Vendor wi ll provide MSDS product information.<BR>10.	 Expiration date must appear on package.<BR>11.	 Alcohol-free Baby Wipes must be available.<BR>12.	 Baby Wipes must be available in scented and unscented. <BR>13.	Disposable Wipes literature must show kill rates and kill times of RSV, HBV, HIV-1, TB, MSRA, VRE, Staphyloccocus aeures and Salmonella.<BR>14.	Baby Wipes must be available with and without moisturizer.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Te am facilitated by the TRBO will request samples (at no charge to the government) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs a nd will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 3PM CST, on the (21st) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will  be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical  evaluation period is estimated to last approximately eight weeks.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like one to five rati ng scale where as: One (Does not meet minimum needs - worst score), Two (Meet minimum needs but is not clinically recommended), Three (Meet minimum needs), Four (Exceed minimum needs), Five (Provides superior clinical advantages - best score).  The CPT has  established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near t he Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT will determine/approve that both product literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation.   The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in ei ther a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation r esults, the CPT will provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outli ned below: <BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.	Disposable Wipes are moist (having enough solution to clean area without leaving wet residue on the surface).<BR>2.	Disposable wipes are strong enough to prevent tearing during use  (tearing or shredding wipe may cause incomplete contact and affect kill times).<BR>3.	Baby Wipes are thick and soft (allow for comfort to hands, face and buttocks and to avoid skin breakdown, patient comfort).<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	 The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.   Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.    <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to su bmit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Thre shold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Region (6, 7 & 8).  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the prod ucts or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts of f of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a  down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competitio n among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis. Pricing will be based on a committed volume  for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation result s become more equal, price will become more important.<BR>7.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB reviews the data for a best value decision.  <BR>8.	The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) will b e a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the submittal.<BR>9.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s). The selection of a single vendor  is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR><BR>

For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regi onal Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  I n this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR><BR>B.

The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team facilitated by the TRBO will request samp les (at no charge to the government) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the  date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 3PM CST, on the (21st ) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration  in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical evaluation period is estimated to last app roximately eight weeks.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale where as: One (Does not meet minimum needs - worst score), Two (Meet minimum needs but is not clinically recommended), Three (Meet  minimum needs), Four (Exceed minimum needs), Five (Provides superior clinical advantages - best score).  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptabi lity as being at or near 3.0 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be dis qualified from further consideration for standardization.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT will determine/approve that both product literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation.   The CPT intends that clinical ev aluations be conducted in a clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the C PT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation results, the CPT will provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source s election procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.	Lab Coats, jackets and/or jumpsuit/coveralls can be donned with out assistance (conserves personnel resources).<BR>2.	Lab Coats, jackets and/or jumpsuit/coveralls neck, waist, and sleeve closures stay secured (to provide barrier protection)<BR>3.	The quality of construction and product strength provides barrier protect ion and prevents staff exposure (critical areas reinforced, fasteners, ties, fabric, etc.).<BR>4.	The components are free from holes and defects (to provide barrier protection and prevent patient exposure).<BR><BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	 The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.   <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the b reak in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqua lified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Ce ntral Region (6, 7 & 8).  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor  quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume o f 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the  Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evalua tion factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.<BR>7.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB reviews the data for a best value decision.  <BR>8.	The DS L will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the submittal.<BR>9.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB v otes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s). The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selecti ons for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR>

Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) is seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Protectiv e Apparel-Shoe Covers, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $77,046.74.  This is included as a reporting metric.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  Full coverage shoe covers, universal fit/size, with and without anti-skid/slip resistance; Ankle high shoe covers, universal fit/size, with and without anti-skid/slip resistance; Boot covers, universal fit/size, with and without anti-skid/slip resistance, leak proof; Shoe covers, impervious.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region (6, 7 & 8) MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-se rvicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS informa tion, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>INTERESTED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS  STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM CST ON 18 March 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide hard copy responses to technical criteria,  no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for mail to be lost, vendors must confirm with the Regional POC stated below that their submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).

Contact Mr. Jim Quinn at (210) 292-3295 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evalua tion Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region (6, 7 & 8). They are  the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>  Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested respondents are to respond to this FBO announcement by mailing their intent to participate with hard copies of the following information: co mpany name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, announcement number, DAPA number and complete answers to the technical criteria to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, t hose vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Also, all communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the busin ess concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submi tted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agre ement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this s tandardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually corre ct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR> The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or  distribute a complete product line of Disposable Protective Apparel-Shoe Covers.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  At a minimum, this includes:   Full coverage shoe covers, universal fit/size, with and without anti-skid/slip resistance; Ankle high shoe covers, universal f it/size, with and without anti-skid/slip resistance; Boot covers, universal fit/size, with and without anti-skid/slip resistance, leak proof; Shoe covers, impervious.  Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distri bute with the initial submittal. <BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Disposable Protective Apparel-Shoe Covers product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initia l submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor, Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and  provide certification of this with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization i nitiative.  Where lower Federal Supply Schedule prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, FSS prices do not represent discounts off the DAPA.  (Note that vendors that fai l to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy pricing quotes and a competitive product cross-reference in the prescribed electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendor must provid e educational tools and materials for Disposable Protective Apparel-Shoe Covers as well as no cost samples for the evaluation.   Describe your available company educational tools and material resources with the initial submittal.    <BR>7.	Vendor must prov ide customer service (telephonic, onsite, website or email) for regional facilities.  Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal. <BR>8.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>9.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or FDA or company recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for Dispo sable Protective Apparel-Shoe Covers including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  Vendors should provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations, and any relief of resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these scenarios and their effects.  <BR>10.	Vendors must provide a standard industry warranty, at a minimum, that includes a return goods policy.  Provide a copy of their policy with their init ial submittals.  The vendor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.<BR>11.	 Vendor provided documentation showing products are available in a variety of  sizes Universal size, Regular, Large and X-Large- provide list of sizes.<BR>12.	Must have styles that provide light to moderate fluid resistance (products shou ld be marked as basic, fluid resistant or fluid impervious).  <BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team facilitated by the TRBO will request samples (at no charge to the government) from the p roduct line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.   Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 3PM CST, on the (21st) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>CPT te ams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical evaluation period is estimated to last approximately eight weeks.  The CPT will evaluate t he clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale where as: One (Does not meet minimum needs - worst score), Two (Meet minimum needs but is not clinically recommended), Three (Meet minimum needs), Four (Exceed minimum needs), Fi ve (Provides superior clinical advantages - best score).  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the br eak in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standar dization.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT will determine/approve that both product literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation.   The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; ho wever, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation results, the CPT will provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate produ cts based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.	The shoe covers stay secured and in-place once donned (to prevent fall out of particulate matter and provide ba rrier protection).<BR>2.	The quality of construction and product strength provides barrier protection and prevents patient exposure (critical areas reinforced, seams, ties, fabric, etc.)<BR>3.	The shoe covers are free from holes and defects (to provide bar rier protection and prevent staff and patient exposure).<BR>4.	The shoe covers prevents strike through during routine use (to provide barrier protection and reduce staff exposure to contamination).<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	 The f ollowing elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.      <BR>2.	 Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the break in t he average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified wi ll be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Reg ion (6, 7 & 8).  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes s hould contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region m ay limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TR BO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation fact ors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.<BR>7.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB reviews the data for a best value decision.  <BR>8.	The DSL will en sure that the prices, with discounts off the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the submittal.<BR>9.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s). The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for R IAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR><BR>

<DESC>A.	General Information. <BR><BR>     The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisia na, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Disposable Protective Apparel-OR Head Covers. <BR ><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that stand ardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston, TX; Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX; Darnall Army Medica l Center, Fort Hood, TX; Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK; William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX; 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO; Evans ACH Fort Carson, CO; Fort  Leonard Wood ACH, MO; Fort Riley, KS; 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV; and Bay ne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must  have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distr ibute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regio nal Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  T he Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be d etermined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In  this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR><BR>B.

Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, ba sed upon the total requirements of the Central Region (6, 7 & 8).  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product line s requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection i s made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further considera tion.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis.

The Technica l/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.<BR>7.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB reviews the data for a best value decision.  <BR>8.	The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the submittal.<B R>9.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s). The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reser ves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.

<DESC>A.	General Information. <BR><BR>     The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisia na, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Disposable Protective Apparel-General Use Gowns. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that st andardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston, TX; Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX; Darnall Army Med ical Center, Fort Hood, TX; Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK; William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX; 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO; Evans ACH Fort Carson, CO; Fort  Leonard Wood ACH, MO; Fort Riley, KS; 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV; and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company m ust have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to di stribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Re gional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.   The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will b e determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) is seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Pro tective Apparel-General Use Gowns, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $714,634.89.  This is included as a reporting matrix.  This forecast is based o n historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  Patient Gown  Universal Size, Universal Cover Gown, Isolation Gown (Yellow), Impervious Gown with Thumb Hooks, Impervious Gown-Ope n Back, Exam Capes, Procedure Gowns and Pediatric Exam Gowns.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region (6, 7 & 8) MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products su pplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>INTERESTED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM CST ON 18 March 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this  submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide hard copy responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quo tes.  Due to the potential for mail to be lost, vendors must confirm with the Regional POC stated below that their submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  E ach submitting vendor will confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>Responses should be sent via your preferred delivery carrier with a requested return rece ipt and/or tracking number to Mr. Jim Quinn, Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230. (ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS TO INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED)  All e-mail communication between vendors and the r egion should be digitally signed.  Contact Mr. Jim Quinn at (210) 292-3295 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing bo dy of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region (6, 7 & 8). They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>  Phase I  Technical/Company Eva luation Process.  Interested respondents are to respond to this FBO announcement by mailing their intent to participate with hard copies of the following information: company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, announcement n umber, DAPA number and complete answers to the technical criteria to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted e qually. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the cl inical/performance evaluation.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Also, all communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally  signed.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of  the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products o r services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors  whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be di squalified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consi deration.<BR><BR> The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Disposable Protective Apparel-General Use Gowns.   A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one  unit per order.  At a minimum, this includes:   Patient Gown  Universal Size; Universal Cover Gown; Isolation Gown (Yellow); Impervious Gown with Thumb Hooks; Impervious Gown-Open Back; Exam Capes; Procedure Gowns; and Pediatric Exam Gowns.  Provide cert ification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal. <BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Disposable Protective Apparel-General Use Gowns product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement w ith the regional prime vendor, Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4.	Vendors m ust provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Where lower Federal Supply Schedule prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore , FSS prices do not represent discounts off the DAPA.  (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy pricing quotes and a competitive product cross-reference in the p rescribed electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendor must provide educational tools and materials for Disposable Protective Apparel-General Use Gowns as well as no cost samples for the evaluation.   Describe your available company educati onal tools and material resources with the initial submittal.    <BR>7.	Vendor must provide customer service via telephonic, onsite, website or email for regional facilities.  Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial su bmittal. <BR>8.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>9.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders an d/or FDA or company recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for Disposable Protective Apparel-General Use Gowns including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  Vendors should provide a context to includ e any mitigating factors for these situations, and any relief of resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these scenarios and their effects.   <BR>10.	Vendors must provide a standard industry warranty, a t a minimum, that includes a return goods policy.  Provide a copy of their policy with their initial submittals.  The vendor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in th is contract.<BR>11.	 Products must be available in a variety of sizes for pediatric and adult (XS to 3X) patients- provide list of sizes  provide documentation.<BR>12.	Must have styles that are suitable for both females and males  provide documentation.< BR>13.	Clothing must have reinforced seams  provide documentation.<BR>14.	Patient Gowns must be available with closure device at the shoulders/arms to allow fo r changing of patients with IVs  provide documentation.<BR>15.	Must have styles that provide light to moderate fluid resistance (products should be marked as basic, fluid resistant or fluid impervious)  provide documentation.  <BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical /Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team facilitated by the TRBO will request samples (at no charge to the government) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 3PM CST, on the (21st) calendar da y after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical set ting.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical evaluation period is estimated to last approximately eight weeks.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale where as: O ne (Does not meet minimum needs - worst score), Two (Meet minimum needs but is not clinically recommended), Three (Meet minimum needs), Four (Exceed minimum needs), Five (Provides superior clinical advantages - best score).  The CPT has established a targe t threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Tar get Threshold of 3.0.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT will determine/a pprove that both product literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation.   The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation results, the CPT will  provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR><BR>C linical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.	Isolation/Exam gowns and capes can be donned without assistance (conserves personnel resources).<BR>2.	The gowns neck, waist, and sleeve closures stay secured (provide barrier protection and prevent patients exposure).<BR>3.	The quality of construction and product strength provides barrier protection and prevents patient exposure (critical areas reinforced, fasteners, ties, fabric, etc.).<BR>4.	The components are free from holes and defects (provide barrier protection and prevent patient exposure).<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	 The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.      <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those ve ndors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are cluster ed near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to su bmit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Region (6, 7 & 8).  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vend or's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the v endor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, i f it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respo nd as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option pe riods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.< BR>7.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB reviews the data for a best value decision.  <BR>8.	The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasi ng commitment, and the technical merit of the submission.<BR>9.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s). The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can mee t the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>

Prep pads are soft, non-abrasive and non-irritating (to avoid damaging dermis, pain an d discomfort)<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	 The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact  of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.      <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 wil l be disqualified from further consideration depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writin g at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Region (6, 7 & 8).  The Reg ion intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor 's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements o f the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of q uotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 yea rs.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.<BR>7.	The Central Region TPRB review s the data for a best value decision.  <BR>8.	The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the s ubmittal.<BR>9.	The Central Region TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s). The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reser ves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only, with specific interest in small business capability.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified small businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 (please see attached market research questions).  No solicitation is being issued at this time.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado, seeks potential sources to perform a variety of non-personal Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) and Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) services in support of Headquarters, Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC), PAFB, Colorado.  A broad range of technical and analytical advisory and assistance and systems engineering and technical assistance shall be provided under this contract to include support or improvement of policy development, management, administration and improvement of systems operations.  This requirement shall also consist of several phases of planning, programming, acquisition, and implementation cycles of various Government systems to complement the Government?s technical expertise in accomplishing its mission.  In rendering the foregoing services, outputs may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, and training services.  Work under this contract will require security clearances.  For reference purposes, the solicitation, when issued, will be numbered FA2517-08-R-9000 and will be a Request for Proposal (RFP).  A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection.  Work performed under the current HQ AFSPC contract will be accessible at the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website.  It is anticipated the contract performance period will be a base period of five years with no option periods, and the program?s ceiling value will be approximately $400 million. Most of the work is expected to be performed on PAFB.  The Government is contemplating award of a multiple award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed price and cost type contract line item numbers (CLINs).  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. No decision has yet been made regarding the small business strategy for this contract.  However, in anticipation of addressing bundling issues, the Government is specifically assessing the availability and potential of small business to perform this work.  Small business is advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, would apply wherein at least 50 percent of the work must be performed by the small business prime contractor alone.  Small businesses wishing to influence the Contracting Officer?s decision regarding small business set-asides are urged to respond to this announcement via e-mail to jamie.dufrene@peterson.af.mil with a courtesy copy to jeane.steed@peterson.af.mil.

Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this notice or any follow-up information requests is voluntary and shall be treated as confidential.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing at this website, FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov.  It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with FAR  52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  Additionally, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 52.204-8, Annual Representations and Certifications, offerors are also reminded to register with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov .   Please provide responses by 22 January 2008.  Any questions may be addressed via e-mail to jeane.steed@peterson.af.mil.

<DESC>1.1      The mission of the Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA) South/SGHC is to support Department of Defense (DoD) health professionals in optimizing the health and wellness of their populations through appropriate, effective and efficient healthcare practices and service delivery.     

1.2      The development of the Behavioral Health Optimization in Primary Care Program  (BHOP) was completed in 2000 and consisted of training of mental health providers in the model and development of the BHOP manual and training materials.  The program underwent USAF legal review and was jointly endorsed by the three AF mental health consultants in October 2000.  In April 2006 via a policy letter it was staffed that additional providers would be hired using Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) funds based on the operational tempo in order to allow active duty mental health providers to work as BHOP providers to provide assistance as required for the Post Deployment Health Reassessment (PDHRA) process.  As a result many of these providers need training in the BHOP model.   In addition, due to attrition of active duty mental health providers, we no longer have a sufficient number of BHOP trainers in order to sustain the program therefore, more active duty providers will need to be trained to become BHOP trainers.  Lastly, due to this lack of trainers most of the active duty social workers have not been trained in the BHOP model over the past few years thus, we will need to increase training of this subspecialty as well.

2.0      DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES      

2.1      SUMMARY OF SERVICES REQUIRED.  The contractor shall provide a Subject Matter Expert (SME) who shall support the BHOP as follows:  

2.1.1	The SME shall provide up to 200 days (40 site visits) of consultation, training,
and training the trainer services at USAF military treatment facilities worldwide, sites and dates to be determined by the BHOP Manager, Lt Col Tracy Neal-Walden in collaboration with the military treatment facilities. A listing of the sites will be provided to the contractor as required by the BHOP Manager.  Training will consist of five full days of academic and clinical training from the contractor at each of the 40 sites.  Training will be provided to two mental health providers at each location.  These providers will be either a social worker or psychologist who is or will be working in a Primary Care Clinic.  Training sites will require a 3-5 day follow-up visit.  The amount of days needed will be coordinated prior to each training by the BHOP Manager and this information will be provided to the contractor prior to each visit.  The SME will be paid based on the number of days of training provided.  

2.1.2	Train 12 mental health providers (at Lackland AFB, Offut AFB, USAF Academy,
Langley AFB, Aviano  AB, Keesler AFB, Lakenheath AB, Travis AFB, Eglin AFB, Hill AFB, Scott AFB, and Elmendorf AB) on how to train this model of integrated care to other mental health providers.  Note: other bases may be substituted for those listed above if necessary.

2.1.3	Provide five workshops on BHOP related material treatment techniques.  Two
workshops will be provided at Wilford Hall Medical Center on 10-11 April 2008.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a Request for Information to assist the Air Force in conducting Market Research.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the Air Force potential requirements for the development, test, and delivery of one pre-production Remote Generator Controller (RGC), and the possibility of an Option for 3 follow-on production units.    The RGC must interface with both the Mobile Electric Power (MEP) MEP-806B (GENSET) and the Joint Treat Emitter (JTE) Threat Emitter Unit (TEU) to control the generator operations.  This control includes but is not limited to start, monitor, adjust report status, and shut down of the GENSET. This development phase is expected to take approximately 6-10 months.

The RGC must be a kit that can be installed in the field by Military Power Production technicians by installing the kit on existing GENSET.  The environmental requirements for the RGC must meet or exceed those of the GENSET.   The government does not have a competitive bid package for the digital interface to the GENSET.  Interested parties should clearly identify with supporting rationale if they have the ability to meet the requirements without this competitive bid package from the Government.  

As part of the associated data package (drawings, data and software necessary for the maintenance and/or competitively contracted maintenance) the Air Force desires to receive no less than "government purpose rights."  If a responding company is not able to meet this requirement, a detailed of list of rights should be included in the response.

All pricing arrangements ae being considered.  However, a rsponding company must provide rationale if they believe that a firm-fixed-price pricing arrangement is not appropriate for the pre-production unit price and/or the production unit price. 

Each interested entity that has the capability to meet the requirements identified above hereby has the opportunity to provide supporting rationale that they can meet the identified requirements; each response may also include any other additional information that is requested within the Sources Sought Synopsis.  The Government also requests that each interested entity also provide a ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude) price for the development/pre-production unit and a ROM price for three follow-on production units; note that delivery of these ROMs is not required.  Note that any response with price data provided to this Sources Sought will not be used to make an award decision, or to obligate the Government in any way. 

Please respond to:  Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, OO-ALC/84 CBSG/PKR; Attn: James G. Thiros; 6039 Wardleigh Road, Bldg. 1206; Hill AFB; UT 84056-5838 (or e-mail: James.Thiros@hill.af.mil), fax (801) 586-3366.

Responses are due no later than 1600 (4:00 PM) MST on 12 March 2008.  No phone responses will be accepted.  

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this sources sought synopsis/Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.  Copies of the submitted information will be reviewed and may be used to develop a Request for Proposal.

<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  As proscribed in the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act, the Air Force is in the process of implementing a fee-for-service aerial refueling (FFS/AR) pilot program as a complement to existing Air Force organic capability.  The purpose of the pilot program is to assess the feasibility and utility of incorporating commercial service provider(s) in Air Force operations long-term.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market research effort being conducted by Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) to determine potential sources capable of providing this fee-for-service aerial refueling service.  Under the pilot program, each service provider refueling aircraft must be able to off-load fuel utilizing centerline flying boom equipment and a probe and drogue system.  The latter may be satisfied by one or both of: 1) centerline hose/drogue equipment; 2) multi-point hose/drogue equipment (i.e. wingtip refueling pods).  No developmental funding is available to capitalize or establish sources capable of providing this service.  Respondents should also assume that no government furnished property will be available to establish any commercial aerial refueling capability (such as excess KC-135 aircraft or spare aerial refueling components such as center-line booms).  The government is interested in identifying sources of commercial-off-the-shelf aerial refueling services that are or will be capable of initiating performance in the FY09/10 timeframe.  Potential sources should include their size status for NAICS code 481212.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research.  This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only.  Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of these questions or to otherwise pay for the information you provide.  Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  This information will be used to assist in developing the acquisition strategy.  Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.

The government may award contracts for concept refinement studies if more detailed information on fee-for-service aerial refueling is needed based on responses to this RFI.  The concept refinement studies may be awarded through the Broad Area Announcement (BAA) process.  If concept refinement studies are needed, they will be synopsized approximately two months from the date of this announcement.

As set forth in the FY08 NDAA, the pilot program will be not less than five years.  Multiple contractors may be selected to participate in the pilot program.  The pilot program will not exceed more than two aerial refueling aircraft per provider.  The pilot program may encompass and/or evaluate the following missions as directed in the FY08 NDAA:  testing support, training support to receiving aircraft, homeland defense support, deployment support, air bridge support, aeromedical evacuation, and emergency air refueling.  Additional missions may be incorporated as Air Force requirements are established.

In responding to this RFI, the government is specifically interested in receiving the following information from interested FFS/AR providers.  Information collected will be used to assist the government in drafting its requirements and establishing its acquisition strategy for the pilot program.

1)	Describe your ability to acquire/develop/operate/certify aerial refueling aircraft equipped with both flying boom-type and multi-point probe and drogue fuel delivery systems in light of the desired FY09/10 pilot program initiation date;

2)	Describe your current or planned capability to hire/train/certify personnel qualified to perform/sustain the aerial refueling service (including flying boom operators);

3)	What are the minimum and maximum allowable annual flying hours you could provide as a FFS/AR pilot program provider?

4)	Identify any anticipated legal/indemnification/insurance issues the government might encounter in utilizing FFS AR from your firm; 

5)	Describe your knowledge of and your capability to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification (to include parts 91, 121, and 125), and public-use certification for the military air refueling issues for CONUS and outside CONUS operations; 

6)	Describe the potential costs-to-the-government of utilizing your commercial fee-for-service program that would not be captured in the pilot program's pricing.  Specifically the government is interested in the potential liabilities it might face at the completion of the pilot program if commercial FFS/AR is not continued with your firm.

7)	Describe your firm's experience in performing in conjunction with Air Mobility Command operations and your organizations ability to integrate its operations (existing or planned) with those of AMC.

8)	In order to reduce the impact to current refueling fleet training during the pilot program, we are interested in proposed billing concepts that enable receiving aircraft to pay for services through their respective flying hour program, versus using existing refueling aircraft flying hour funding.  Describe your capability to utilize this type of billing procedure.

9)	Describe your firm's current or planned capability to collect the following data for the pilot program as directed by Section 1081 of the 2008 NDAA:
(a) Missions flown;
(b) Mission areas supported;
(c) Receiver aircraft number, type, model series refueled;
(d) Fuel dispensed;
(e) Departure reliability rates;

10)	Describe any other fee-for-service program efforts you may have had with the U.S. Government for aerial refueling or other air transport services.     If any, please state your last commitment.
a)	Type of service provided
b)	Date(s) of service provided
c)	Government point of contact (name, phone number, e-mail address)

11)	Identify the quantity, size and type of aerial refueling equipment organic to your company at the present time.

12)	Are your company's existing or planned aircraft or AR equipment owned or leased?

13)	Are your personnel currently qualified to provide aerial refueling services of the types contemplated above?

14)	If not, describe your firm's plans to ensure they are qualified and provide your concept to maintain aircrew proficiency. 

15)	What percentage of your company's assets or fleet will be dedicated to USAF support during the pilot program?

16)	What is your expected turn around time for providing aerial refueling mission support to AMC (i.e. time between sorties)?

17)	What is the location of your present/planned operating locations for AR services?

18)	How much advance notification is required to meet AMC AR mission tasking requirements under the pilot program?

19)	Request you supply the Air Force with a copy of your company's portfolio (e.g., balance sheet, income statement and statement of retained earnings).

20)	Provide company point(s) of contact, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and company status (i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.).
Responses submitted should be one copy, a maximum of fifty pages in length, and must be received by 28 March 2008.  Request for Information responses may be submitted electronically or regular mail, but require both electronic and hard copies of responses.   Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size in accordance with the size standard; ensure that the company name, address, a point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number, Federal CAGE Code, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 

INTRODUCTION

1.  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is developing its requirements and technical specifications for communication between Application Service Providers (ASPs) and the U.S. National Data Center (NDC) within the international Long-Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) system.

2.  BACKGROUND

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), at its eighty-first session in May 2006, adopted amendments to chapter V of the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention in relation to LRIT.  This new LRIT regulation, which entered into force on January 1, 2008, requires all ships subject to SOLAS Chapter V/19-1 to transmit LRIT information on a phased-in schedule beginning December 31, 2008. Subject to any future changes in the regulation, all U.S. flagged vessels will be required to provide their position to the U.S. NDC four (4) times daily.  The LRIT system provides for the global identification and tracking of ships.  Communication specifications within the international LRIT system detail the messaging format between LRIT components, data security throughout the network, and the protocols required for transporting data from one network point to another.  The USCG desires to assess the current industry capabilities regarding the communication specifications for the U.S. portion of the system, including message format, data security, and protocols for transporting data.

2.1 General Description of the System and Definitions

System Description:  As described in resolution MSC.210 (81), sub-section 1.2, the LRIT system consists of the following components:

1.	The shipborne LRIT information transmitting equipment

2.	The Communication Service Provider(s)

3.	The Application Service Provider(s)

4.	The LRIT Data Centre(s), including any related Vessel Monitoring 	System(s)

5.	The LRIT Data Distribution Plan

6.	The International LRIT Data Exchange

7.	LRIT Data Users.

 
2.2 LRIT System Operation

Tracking of any applicable ship begins with LRIT positional data being transmitted from the shipborne equipment.  The LRIT information transmitted includes the ship?s GNSS position (based on the WGS84 datum), time, and identification, as described in resolution MSC.210 (81).  The Communication Service Provider (CSP) provides the communication infrastructure and services necessary for establishing a communication path between the ship and the ASP.  The LRIT information transmitted from the ship will travel across the communication path set up by the CSP to the ASP.  The ASP, after receiving the LRIT information from the ship, will add additional information to the LRIT message and pass the expanded message to its associated LRIT NDC.  Functionality required for the programming and communicating of commands to the shipborne equipment is provided by the ASP.  The LRIT data, along with all the parameters added by the various LRIT components, is described in the messaging section of the MSC Communications document.  LRIT Data Centers will store all incoming LRIT information from ships instructed by their Administrations to transmit LRIT information to that Data Centre.  LRIT Data Centers will disseminate LRIT information to LRIT Data Users according to the Data Distribution Plan (DDP). The LRIT DDP will contain the information required by the Data Centers for determining how LRIT information will be distributed to the various Contracting Governments.  The DDP will contain information such as standing orders from Contracting Governments and geographical polygons relating to Contracting Governments? coastal waters, ports, and port facilities.  LRIT Data Centers will process all LRIT messages to and from the International LRIT Data Exchange (IDE).  The IDE will process all LRIT messages between LRIT Data Centers.  The IDE will route the message to the appropriate Data Center based upon the address in the message and the IP addresses in the DDP.  LRIT Data Users may be entitled to receive or request LRIT information in their capacity as a Flag State, Port State, Coastal State, or Search and rescue (SAR) services.  

2.2.1 Definitions

1.	Convention means the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended.

2.	Regulation means a regulation of the Convention.

3.	Chapter means a chapter of the Convention.

4.	LRIT Data User means a Contracting Government or a SAR service that opts to receive the LRIT information it is entitled to.

5.	Committee means the Maritime Safety Committee.

6.	High-speed craft means a craft as defined in regulation X/1.3.

7.	Mobile offshore drilling unit means a mobile offshore drilling unit as defined in regulation XI-2/1.1.5.

8.	International Routing Rules means a list of all Data Centers with their associated IP addresses as identified in the DDP.

9.	Organization means the International Maritime Organization.

10.	Vessel Monitoring System means a system established by a Contracting Government or a group of Contracting Governments to monitor the movements of the ships entitled to fly its or their flag.  A Vessel Monitoring System may also collect from the ships information specified by the Contracting Government(s) that has established it.

11.	LRIT information means the information specified in SOLAS regulation V/19-1.5.

12.	The term ?ship,? when used in the present Performance standards and functional requirements for long-range identification and tracking of ships, includes mobile offshore drilling units and high-speed craft as specified in SOLAS regulation V/19-1.4.1 and means a ship that is required to transmit LRIT information.  

Terms not otherwise defined should have the same meaning as the meaning attributed to them in the Convention.

2.2.2 Acronyms 

The acronyms that appear within this document shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Article.

1.	ASP Application Service Provider

2.	CSP Communication Service Provider

3.	DC LRIT Data Centre

4.	DDP LRIT Data Distribution Plan

5.	IDE International LRIT Data Exchange

6.	NDC National Data Centre

7.	SOLAS International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea

Communication within the LRIT System

2.3 Message Types:  Communication within the LRIT system is based upon three types of messages passing between the various components of the LRIT system:  LRIT request messages, LRIT ship position report messages, and other system messages.  Request messages are those requesting specific LRIT information.  LRIT ship position report messages are those containing LRIT ship positional data.  Other messages managed by the system include:  Billing and transaction messages, receipt messages, DDP related messages, costing and billing related messages, system status messages, and pricing messages.  Figure 2 illustrates the LRIT system components as well as the various communications segments in the LRIT network.

3.  PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The USCG is assessing whether ASP?s can provide XML formatted data to meet our IMO MSC LRIT requirements.  In furtherance of this effort, respondents are encouraged to provide information about XML message formatting, or alternative methodologies that can help the USCG better understand the potential of exchanging positional information with U.S. flagged ships.  The USCG also wishes to know if ASP?s are capable of meeting the requirement to provide positional information for all US flagged vessels within the performance specifications set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The USCG also desires to determine the estimated period of time it will take ASP?s to have the capability to provide properly formatted data from all US vessels subject to the regulations to the US NDC.

4.  DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

The USCG is seeking sources that are capable of producing XML formatted data to meet its IMO MSC LRIT requirements, preferably via GSA schedule contract holders.  The USCG is seeking interest and capability of firms to discuss the ASP?s capabilities with regards to the requirements discussed in this RFI, the ASP?s system requirements, the ASP?s integration specifications (if available), and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance the USCG?s understanding of the information submitted.  Respondents should also complete the Potential Requirements Table which contains provisional requirements for the USCG?s LRIT positional data requirements.  We recognize that not all requirements may be met by a single software system.  Please indicate in your response which capabilities can be provided via commercial off the shelf software versus custom developed solutions.  For requirements that are met by commercial off the shelf software, please also include the product name, release number, and release date of the software.  Please indicate the ability of your ASP to provide positional information for all US flagged vessels (or alternatively for what portion of US flagged vessels).

5.  DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 10, ?Market Research?, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI, and are requested NOT to send proprietary information.  Responses indicative of proprietary information will NOT be reviewed by the USCG and returned to the Respondent.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.

6.  HOW TO RESPOND

Firms who wish to respond to this RFI should include their business size, CAGE code, Dun and Bradstreet number and GSA schedule, should they hold one.  Please submit information to include any pricing, GSA Schedule information that is applicable, comments on the specification and requirements via email to Mr. Todd W.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NB853000-8-33247DR
<RESPDATE>031208
<ARCHDATE>03122008
<CONTACT>Diana Romero, Contract Specialist , Phone 303-497-3761, Fax 303-497-3761, Email diana.romero@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA's Acquisition & Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with MTS Systems Corporation, of Eden Prairie, MN, for the purchase of replacement parts for a MTS controller.

The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirement for a replacement controller upgrade for a 100 kN servo-hyraulic fatigue system (Flextest 40) and proprietary 793.40 software that must be compatible and interchangeable with existing MTS test machines. MTS is the only vendor that manufactures this equipment that meets the technical requirements. This interchangeability factor saves the Government substantial dollars by eliminating the cost of training personnel on new equipment, and the purchase of additional controllers to develop interchangeability capability. The Government currently has 7 MTS test machines and it is essential to maintain continuity in our operating systems. Delivery shall be made on or before June 9, 2008.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government?s requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

The Fort Peck Lake is the nations fourth largest manmade reservoir and backs up from the dam approximately 135 river miles to  the west and south. Surrounding the water surface, the Fort Peck Project also encompasses over 400,000 acres in McCone, Valley, Garfield, Phillips, Petroleum, and Fergus Counties. Nearly the entire Fort Peck Project is within the Charles M. Russell Nation al Wildlife Refuge (CMR), which is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service).  Four recreation areas on the Fort Peck Lake (Fort Peck, the Pines, Hell Creek, and Rock Creek) have cottage areas (cabin sites) within them. These cabin sites are within areas designated by the Corps for intensive use recreation and there are individual cabin site lots leased by the Corps.  Title VIII of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 authorized Secretary of the Army, working with Secretary of the Inter ior, to identify cabin sites suitable for conveyance (i.e., sale) to current lessees and to perform the necessary environmental and real estate activities to di spose of these cabin sites at fair market value. The funds received from the conveyance of the cabin sites will be deposited in the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Trust for use in acquiring other lands with greater wildlife and other public value f or the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge Cabin Sites - Within the intensive use recreation areas (Fort Peck, the Pines, Hell Creek, and Rock Creek), four cottage areas have been designated (Figure 1). Collectively, the cottage areas include indiv idual lots leased by the Corps to private individuals in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 460d. The lessees have constructed cabins or cottages on these lots that are on federal lands managed by the Corps and within the exterior boundaries of the CMR National Wil dlife Refuge.

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.
Local DMC clauses, 52.0100-4028 (Contract Contact Information)(DMC) (JUN 2005) and 52.0100-4094 (Marking Instructions for All Items to Include Drop Ship and Direct Shipment) (JUN 2004), will be included. 

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an ?Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)? be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an ?Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)? be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the ?Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)? or the ?Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)? option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the ?Invoice? option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<SUBJECT>D -- Cable Television Programming Subscription Services
<DESC>This is a ?Notice of Intent? that the Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Cebridge Acquisition, L.P. dba Suddenlink Communications a contract to provide Television Programming Subscription Services Contract Description under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  The rationale for soliciting sole source with the one source is that the cable television infrastructure (equipment and cable television lines used for this service) at the various locations on Cannon AFB, NM, is solely owned and operated by this commercial cable television provider.  No other firm has the required infrastructure in place or the authority to use the existing one.  The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to provide either satellite or cable television programming subscription services to Cannon AFB Government owned buildings.  The Government will provide a location on Cannon AFB with adequate room for Contractor owned equipment.  Adequate room will be made available to install the needed dish antennas or head-in system.  The Contractor will be required to wire to the Government equipment, which is located in the Public Affairs office, to inject the Government Access Channel(s) signal.  The Contractor will furnish, at their expense, all satellite receivers, hardware or cable boxes needed to provide television programming services to government administrative, lodging and public areas at Cannon AFB.  This will include more than one receiver/cable box per building if needed.  The capability must exist to change the channel at each television and to be able to watch different programming at each television at the same time.  Satellite Contractors will minimize the number of satellite dishes required to provide coverage to Cannon AFB areas by using best available technology.  NOTE:  Residential television programming subscription service is not included in this solicitation.  Currently, the cable television infrastructure at the various locations on Cannon AFB is owned and operated by an existing commercial cable television provider.  Therefore, the prospective television-programming providers must furnish at its own expense necessary infrastructure to distribute the television-programming signal to all specified facilities.  In instances where there is no existing cable infrastructure at a facility requiring television programming, the Contractor will provide and install all needed equipment.  The Government Access channels must be available on all cable TV drops.  The Contractor will provide a minimum of three tiers of service (1) Government Administrative Basic, (2) Government Lodging and (3) Government Public Viewing areas.  Government Access Channel:  The Contractor shall provide at no additional cost to the Government, at least one Government access channel on the system for noncommercial use by the Government.  The system shall be designed and constructed to permit the Government to originate programming for the Government Access Channel from a single facility on the Base.

<SUBJECT>D -- NOAA GFDL RESEARCH NETWORK
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue a sole-source contract to MAGPI, Suite 221A, 3401 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104. The period of performance for this effort will be five years, with a one-year base period and four one-year options. The Government intends to award this contract on March 24, 2008.  

This procurement is being conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) only one responsible source, which applies when the services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of service will satisfy agency needs. 

BACKGROUND
In order to support the various missions of the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), NOAA has a requirement for Internet, Internet2 and other research network connectivity. This connectivity provides a bidirectional path for information to the American Public, other U.S Government organizations, Universities, and the world research community. GFDL continuously moves large quantities of data in and out of the laboratory over existing network connections. GFDL is one of the providers of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data. Although the general public has access to many of the IPCC data sets, the primary users of this information are research partners. These research partners are generally affiliated with universities and are located worldwide. In order to provide connectivity to GFDL customers, connections to both the commercial Internet and other research networks are required. The commercial Internet is the network that is most commonly used by government, corporations, small companies, and individuals. When people use the term *Internet* they generally mean the commercial Internet.  

The Internet2 and National Lambda Rail (NLR) are next generation networks that have been built on an advanced backbone that interconnects regional network aggregation points called GigaPOPs. The Internet2 (I2) project is being led by a consortium of 205 universities called the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Design (UCAID). NOAA, as an organization, is a member of UCAID. UCAID is working in partnership with industry and government to develop and deploy advanced network applications and technologies. A connection to I2 or NLR can only be acquired through one of the regional GigaPOPs and requires membership in UCAID. An organization connected to I2 or NLR is only allowed to use the network for research related traffic. All other network traffic must traverse the commercial Internet. Organizations connecting to I2 or NLR are required to be connected to at least one commercial Internet provider. Most of the network traffic in and out of GFDL is research related and flows to and from UCAID organizations. 

The regional GigaPOP that provides I2 and NLR connectivity in the Princeton area is MAGPI. MAGPI is a consortium of local Universities, research organizations and government agencies that cooperate to form an aggregation point in order to share Wide Area Networking (WAN) services including commercial Internet, Internet2, NLR and local peering. (Local peering is the virtually free network connectivity among MAGPI partners that occurs because of the aggregation point.) 

MAGPI is the regional GigaPOP responsible for access to these national research networks and commercial Internet connectivity in the Philadelphia area. As described above, the only way to access these research networks is through regional GigaPOPs. MAGPI is the regional source for GigaPOP and I2 in the Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware Area to which Princeton, NJ belongs. Commercial companies do not provide GigaPOP services.
 
REQUIREMENTS
The Contractor shall provide a single managed solution for access to national and international research networks including, but not limited to, Internet2 (I2) and National Lambda Rail (NLR). The Contractor shall have the capacity to provide access to research networks at speeds of 10Gbs or higher. The Contractor shall provide fiber from Princeton University Site B Sayre Hall, 300 Forrestal Rd Princeton New Jersey to 401 Broad St Philadelphia Pennsylvania. The Contractor shall provide a fiber planet solution that is robust and cost effective. The Contractor shall provide hardware to support each end of the connection. The Contractor shall size chassis hardware to allow for additional independent services, with scalability to at least 200 % growth. The Contractor shall initially size hardware for a 10Gbs DWDM circuit. The Contractor shall manage hardware support to include routine maintenance, upgrades, and repairs. The Contractor shall provide and manage any required cross connects. The Contractor shall provide all management and oversight of potential subcontractors. The Contractor shall provide 24x7 monitoring of solution health. The Contractor shall have the capability to provide NOAA/GFDL with access to OSI model layers 1, 2, and 3 across these research networks.

REPORTS, DATA, DELIVERABLES
The Contractor shall provide: End-to-end Optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) results; End-to-end Optical loss measurement; Access to circuit utilization reports and graphs providing at least the 5 minute average; A detailed path map (street level); The mean time to repair in the event of a cut; Report of root cause for all unplanned outages; Notification to GFDL Operations of outages within 1 hour of initial outage and provide status updates every 2 hours till corrected; Notification to the GFDL POC of all planned outages.

RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE
Offerors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirements set forth. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements. The response must be sufficient to permit the agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. local time, March 12, 2008.

<SUBJECT>R -- Upper Air Observation Services for the National Weather Service
<DESC>***NOAAs Acquisition & Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with the incumbent contractor, Short Wave Weather of Del Rio, Texas, for the continuation of upper air observations in Del Rio, Texas.  This is an out-of-scope modification to extend the performance period under the current contract RA1330-03-CN-0011.  The purpose of the 8 month extension (April 1, 2008 through November 30, 2008) is to act as a bridge until a new competitively awarded contract can be executed.  

***This contract provides the National Weather Service (NWS) with Upper Air Observations in Del Rio, Texas.  This service is performed by certified weather observers. The radiosonde observations gathered by the NWS upper air contract station in Del Rio, Texas are extremely critical for weather forecasts, in particular, for specific identification of life threatening severe weather potential in the Central Texas area, including the threat of severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, damaging winds and/or large hail.   In addition, the upper air data attained from Del Rio is essential for determining environmental steering currents for hurricane track forecasts and in the initiation of forecast numerical model predictions.

***The current contractor, Short Wave Weather, is the only contractor who possesses the immediate local and specific operational knowledge and readily available trained staff who can provide a seamless continuation of this critical upper air data for the NWS until such time that a new contractor can be selected and trained to assume upper air operations.

***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide services that fully meet the Government?s requirements may submit substantiation documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

Contractors interested in being notified directly about the follow on competitive five year contract (base plus four 1-year options) should send an email to Susan Labovitz, Contract Specialist, at susan.labovitz@noaa.gov.

<SUBJECT>A--DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SPEED, VARIABLE SPEED REFUEL DROGUE
<DESC>This 18 Jan 2008 Amendment changes the anticipated RFP release date from  "to be determined" to 18 Jan 2008.  The PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE was first  posted on 20 DECEMBER 2007, and titled DEVELOPMENT OF VARIABLE SPEED,  VARIABLE DRAG REFUELING DROGUE (VSD/VDD).  The 14 January 2008 Amendment  added the following information to the VSD/VDD Demonstration: For the  purposes of the VSD/VDD Demonstration, a Safety of Flight Certificate is  defined as a signed statement from the company based on the data presented  in the safety of flight package and when operated to the defined  limitations their drogue is safe for flight. VSD/VDD DEMONSTRATION Potential offerors have the option of participating in a demonstration of  their existing Variable Speed Drogue/Variable Drag Drogue (VSD/VDD)  candidate.  A potential offeror?s participation is strictly voluntary and  a decision not to participate will not adversely affect the government?s  future evaluation of any proposal. The demonstration will be used by the  government to assist in risk assessment. A potential offeror that decides  not to participate in the flight demonstration may still participate in  the resulting acquisition. All flight demonstrations will be performed on  a legacy MC-130E/P tanker with Sargent Fletcher Incorporated (SFI) 48-000-  2/4 refueling pods. Potential offerors who are contemplating participation  in the flight demonstration are asked to provide information as presented  below.  This information is necessary to make necessary arrangements at  the Government flight test facility.  Flight demonstration is expected to  take place during the week of 25 February 2008.  However, this is a  tentative date and is subject to change. A team from the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) 413 Flight  Test Squadron (FLTS) stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida, will conduct  the flight testing.  The 413 FLTS will conduct the flight testing at the  Eglin Air Force Base/Hurlburt Field local area testing range. The offeror does not need to be present at the flight demo to have their  candidate drogue flown.  The offeror can elect to send the drogue and the  appropriate technical data to the locations provided.  If the offeror  elects to attend the flight demo, he/she will be provided a post-flight  test briefing of the results.  Following the fight test, a video and brief  summary of the flight test results will be provided to the offeror.  If  the offeror is not present, the video and brief report will be mailed to  the offeror along with return of the hardware provided for the demo. The  offeror will only be permitted to view the demonstration of their specific  drogue and any video recording will include only their drogue  demonstration and no other. The drogue will be flown in accordance with the offeror?s safety  restrictions and envelope which has been validated by wind tunnel testing  to be within the drag limits of the Sargent Fletcher pod.  A safety of  flight package consisting of, as a minimum, airspeed versus drag data,  flight limitations, verification of structural integrity and physical  interfaces shall be provided to the government.  The offerors will be  responsible for providing the necessary modification hardware to the  existing Sargent Fletcher pod with associated technical data.  The offeror  will provide any required checklists and a complete listing of the  configuration of the flight evaluation drogue and pod modifications.  The  government reserves the right to limit pod modifications based on  complexity of the modification.  No modifications shall be allowed that  will not allow the government to return the pod to the pre-modified  condition. 2.0  Offeror Requirements for Flight Testing The offeror shall: Submit to the government (see below address) by COB 24 January 2008 the  following documents:    	(a) 	Flight safety certificates 	(b)	Flight instructions and limitations 	(c)	Pod modification or maintenance instructions 	(d)  Physical dimensions of collapsed drogue including diameter and  length 	(e)	Address: 	ASC/668 AESS 	1895 5th Street, Building 46 	WPAFB, OH 45433-7200 	Attn: Mr. John Shock Submit to the government (see below address) 7 days prior to the scheduled  ground/flight evaluation the following: 	(a)	Drogues (include spare drogue(s) if desired) 	(b)	Visit request if representative is attending in person 	(c)	Address:	413th  Flight Test Squadron 	320 Tully Street 	Bldg 90343 	Hurlburt Field, FL 	Attn: Mr. Jim O?Brien At government request be prepared to participate in the government Safety  Review Board. 3.0  Government Support of Flight Evaluation The government will provide: 	(a)	C-130 equipped with Sargent Fletcher 48000- 02/04 pods 	(b)	Test pilot and crew 	(c)	MA-2/3 refueling coupling interface 	(d)	Chase aircraft and crew 	(e)	Video and photography equipment 	(f)	Safety Review Board 	(g)	A brief test report and video of results This is a change to the reference pre-solicitation notice.

The Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration requires a contractor to partner in the seventeenth (17) annual National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week in March 2009. 

Background:

There is a need for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA/CSAT) to continue with a contractor to provide support for an education campaign to alert the public to the dangers of inhalants.  SAMHSA/CSAT support will be provided to identify the latest research data on inhalants including what constitutes effective treatment from various experts which may include persons from pertinent Federal agencies, the faith community, foundations, medical groups, trade associations, poison control centers and other interested parties.  SAMHSA/CSAT support will enable the contractor to hold a press conference in Washington to kick-off National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week in March 2009 and to stimulate media coverage of the dangers of inhalant use and abuse.

Through the Washington, DC news conference and associated radio, television and Internet programming during the weeklong observance, SAMHSA/CSAT will gain an opportunity to help spotlight an effort that seeks to provide hope and help to youth and families suffering from inhalant abuse.  Press related activities will be coordinated with SAMHSA?s Office of Communications.

	FAR 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items) (OCT 2003)
	FAR 52.212-5 (Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items) (SEP 2007) (DEVIATION)

	DFARS 252.204-7004, Alt A (Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (NOV 2003)
	DFARS 252-232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests
	DFARS 252.246-7000 (Material Inspection and Receiving Report) (MAR 2003)
	
Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.
Local DMC clauses, 52.0100-4028 (Contract Contact Information)(DMC) (JUN 2005) and 52.0100-4094 (Marking Instructions for All Items to Include Drop Ship and Direct Shipment) (JUN 2004), will be included. 

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an ?Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)? be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an ?Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)? be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the ?Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)? or the ?Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)? option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the ?Invoice? option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.           

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.           Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).     Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

4.	Contractor Qualifications

The contractor shall have NDE personnel who meet the standards or qualifications set forth in ANSI-AWS D1.2-1990 and in ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section V-1989.

5.	Government-Furnished Property, Data, and Information

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Technical Information Contact will inform the contractor 48 hours prior to services being rendered by the Contractor.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The M1D (Diesel Powered Foamer) unit was developed to be a self contained foaming unit.  It utilizes a 7HP diesel engine that produces compressed air and operates the foam unit.  It is per fect for large jobs or remote locations where compressed air is not available.  Foam provides maximum contact time for chemical effectiveness.  Foam reduces the amount of labor needed to clean the aircraft.  Foam offers savings in chemical and water usage.   55 gallon tank for extended foaming, 7 HP diesel engine, 50 feet of foam hose, 8 inch elastomeric rigid wheels; Secondary air hook up to run air tools.  Also needed is the Helicopter Belly Foamer, which is designed to roll under the helicopter and foam t he underside of the airframe.  This foam attachment can be used on multiple airframes and saves labor by eliminating the need for creepers and brushes. It can be quick coupled into any foam unit to quickly change a standard foamer into a belly foamer.

During the first phase, the contractor will disassemble, package, transport and reassemble an A-10 aircraft from Pope AFB, NC to Seymour Johnson AFB, NC.  The contractor will transport the aircraft to a designated hangar and reassemble the aircraft in a towable condition.  The contractor shall also fabricate and install the upper portion of the support column (TS 16?x16?) with a base plate and top mount similar to that shown on Sheet S-1 and also used for the F15E, F100, and F86 static displays currently on display at Seymour Johnson AFB.  The contractor shall be responsible for designing the column-to-aircraft connection details on top of the upper column. This upper column shall be fabricated to be compatible with the lower section of the column as far as bolt alignments, etc (also shown on Sheet S-1). The proposed pitch for the A-10 is 15 degrees nose high and the proposed bank is zero degrees (wings level). The aircraft will then be turned over to members of the 4 MXG for the restoration process.  The aircraft is currently designated to be added to the aircraft park display located within Heritage Park.  The aircraft is planned, tentatively, to be placed between the F-100 and F-86 aircraft.  The 4 FW will have the ground portion of the stand (pylon), completed prior to the return of the contractor.  
During the second phase the contractor will return to Seymour Johnson AFB to mount the A-10 (with integral upper column) on an existing lower support column (TS 24?x24?) with the top plate and bolt pattern as shown on Sheet S-1.  The contractor will remove the outer wing panels to permit towing of the aircraft from the flight line to the display site and will reassemble the wings at the display site.  During installation of the aircraft mounting plate, the contractor will keep visual modifications to the aircraft to a minimum and replace any removed skin panels with like aircraft grade metal and fasteners.  The contractor will lift the aircraft onto the designated stand (pylon) and securely attach the two pylons at the mounting plates.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.   Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:   solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.   The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.   Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 8 FEB 2008, 5:00 P.M.

SUBJECT: The purpose of this Amendment is to provide Attachment 1 to the Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for an Advisor for Human Resources and Operations (Intermittent PSC, OTI Bullpen) in Washington, DC. 

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

Both broodstock strains will be provided to the hatchery by the NMFS and RIDEM.
