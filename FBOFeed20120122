<p>1.3 Traditional support includes Assault Landing Zone (LZ) and Drop Zone (DZ) control and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) to support both personnel and aircraft during Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) training, Target Acquisition (TA). Opposing Forces (OPFOR) support provides a ground or water aggressor role-playing force against both personnel and aircraft during all types of training to include Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape (SERE) training.

<p>2. OBJECTIVE OF MARKET RESEARCH: This market research is conducted to assist in determining acquisition strategy for the subject procurement. Specifically, feedback is sought from industry in regards to commercial practices to obtaining the required services, as well as the capability of industry in providing the required services within our military environment. Contract type, commercial practices, and performance-based specifications are being considered in development of the solicitation. Your input will greatly assist in this development. A draft performance work statement (PWS) is being posted to this website (www.fbo.gov), and you are invited to review this document and provide feedback on the document itself, as well as to the below questions.</p>
<p>3. QUESTIONS: Please review the associated DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) posted to this site and the following questions, and provide any input you would like considered as we formulate the acquisition. Please mark any information that you wish to be protected as "acquisition sensitive" or "proprietary." We expect to make further postings of draft documents (including a draft solicitation) in the coming weeks, in anticipation of issuing a final solicitation in the next few months. Your contribution is welcome throughout this process.</p>
<p>4. GENERAL <br />a. Are services similar to our requirement typically performed utilizing standard, commercial regulations/standards? Do other commercial contracts include any industry-specific training, certification, or performance requirements that are in conflict with the referenced Air Force standards?

<p>f. The proposed contract will be solicited on a best-value basis, Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) with technical factors. Please identify any criteria you feel should be considered as part of the proposal evaluation criteria, as well as proposal page limitations that would be sufficient.</p>
<p>5. PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT - Draft</p>
<p>a. What changes, if any, do you suggest we make to the draft PWS to allow for a more performance-based requirement? Please identify any portions of the draft PWS that, as written, are too restrictive or prohibit the flexibility to perform according to your established practices.</p>
<p>b. Identify any particular requirements that will drive up costs and/or risks to performance in meeting our mission.</p>
<p>c. Do the referenced mandatory Air Force instructions and other publications conflict with established commercial practices? Provide any comments you may have as to standard commercial practices for procuring similar services in the commercial marketplace.</p>
<p>d. Please provide any comments you may have regarding the estimated workload as shown in the draft PWS. Identify any limitations to fixed-pricing of the effort.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patientâ€™s condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veteranâ€™s care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (Â§5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following: Admission identification record; VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care or State-approved referral form; Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician; Physician orders; Progress notes; the physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen; special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.; SMA Patient Assessment Form (only if SMA level of care is used); and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information, provided to VA upon admission and every six months thereafter.
15.  The beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the nursing care and treatment plan received from VA unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  Level of Care Classification Effective Records: VA will contract for 53 categories of care under Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-III).  A description of the RUG-III systems can be found in Â§42 CFR Parts 409, et.al.  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing homeâ€™s Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patientâ€™s stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.  The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VAâ€™s request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements â€“ All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.
18.  The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site inspection of the Nursing Home by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.  It is agreed that the Nursing Home shall provide VA with copies of all state agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VAâ€™s quality improvement-quality assurance program functions relating to this agreement, including VAâ€™s on-site inspection and monitoring.   The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the contractorâ€™s reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.
SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: (1) TERMINATION OF SERVICES:  VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the nursing home at any time, when it is determined to be in the best interest of the VA or the patients, without additional costs to the Government (2) EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT:  This agreement may be extended for four (4) one year periods at the option of the Government in accordance with 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  Notice of an extension must be served in writing by the Government sixty days prior to the scheduled expiration date.  The extension is granted subject to the availability of funds, (3) MINIMUM QUANTITIES:  It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this agreement.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this agreement, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the nursing home as outlined in this agreement.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one day, (4) LIFE SAFETY CODE CLAUSE:  The administrator of your facility is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer at least 3 days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility, which were in existence at the time this contract was issued.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Fire Safety Officer responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of your facility and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval/disapproval of your facility to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes. Examples of facility change (but not limited to) that require VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows; interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen/trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls/doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems, (5) If the veteran had a former VA primary care physician, VA policy precludes this provider being available to the veteran during the period of nursing home care.  The assigned nursing home physician is the primary doctor during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the community nursing home.  The community nursing home physician is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Physician visits will be according to medical assistance guidelines.  The assigned nursing home physician will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care, easy access to staff for consultation, provide timely response to calls and arrange for timely physician back-up according to OBRA guidelines (Ref. 42 CFR 483.40 OBRA Guidelines), (6) In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident; advance directives/living wills shall be considered according to nursing home doctorâ€™s orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian, or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VAMC is contacted by the private hospital physician within 72 hours of admission.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care, (7) VA MEDICAL CENTER CONSULTATION/RESOURCES: (a)  Telephone Care Communications System (TCCS):  For urgent-same day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 605-336-3230 x6181 between 9AM and 3PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same day appointment is anticipated, please call as early as possible, (b) Admissions System phone number 605-336-3230.  For non-emergency consultation/evaluation for admission to the VA Medical Center (after initial evaluation/intervention by the nursing home physician), (8) Ancillary Services/Supplies:  Any additional cost to the all-inclusive contract must be preapproved according to the following terms: (a) Medications/supplies will be billed/paid according to generic average wholesale pricing guidelines; monthly invoices verifying cost must be submitted for payment of any additional approved rates. Discharge Medications â€“ on the day of discharge, the facility will dispense medications for a 14 day supply to the veteran and facility can bill to the VA at the AWP, and  (b)  Billing:  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) will not be billed for uncovered services/costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.  Reimbursement for all bed holds will be 70% of the prevailing per diem rate.  After a patient absence of fifteen (15) consecutive days the patient authorization for VA contract care ends, and (10) The contract nursing home will assume responsibility for arranging dental care at the veteranâ€™s/familiesâ€™ expense.

<DESC><p>Amendment 01:</p>
<p>1. Extending closing date to January 31, 2012 3:00&nbsp;PM Kabul local time.<br />2. Attached Q&amp;A.<br />3. Amendment 01 with attachement.<br /><br />Intial announcement:<br />USAID/Afghanistan, U.S. Embassy Kabul invites you to express interest to enter into a Blanket Purchase Agreement or Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract that establishes the terms and conditions applicable to future purchases of Financial Services as detailed in section 2.</p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is contemplating announcing an RFP for award of one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) or Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to multiple sources. USAID also reserves the right to award a single BPA agreement or IDIQ contract, if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.</p>
<p>A Blanket Purchase Agreement is not a contract. A Blanket Purchase Agreement is a simplified method of procuring quantities of services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish through the issuance of a BPA Call Order authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Payment of (BPA) Call Orders issued under a BPA will be made by the authorized Paying Office as approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>USAID may place a Minimum Guarantee amount on the BPA. In the past this amount has been $3,000.00. However, currently that amount is not final.</p>
<p>An IDIQ is a contract. An IDIQ is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract that selected vendors are in a position to compete through a Request to Task Order Proposal (RFTOP) process for Task Order award. Individually, RFTOPs are solicited to each IDIQ contract holder and award is made through a competitive process.</p>
<p>Payment of Task Orders issued under an IDIQ will be made by the authorized Paying Office as approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>It is undetermined at this time, if USAID will place a Minimum Guarantee amount on the IDIQ contract. Certainly, this is an area that will receive questions.</p>
<p>Determination to award a BPA or IDIQ contract mechanism will be made by the Contracting Officer after careful analysis of qualified interested parties that response to this Request for Information-Sources Sought-1201 (306-RFI-SS-12-01).</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The Purpose of this RFI-SS is to obtain a list of interest parties that can provide services of a Contracted Accounting/Financial Management firm who has experience or the proper staff skills sets to perform the following in accordance with section 2:<br />- Pre-award Surveys/Assessments<br />- Host Country Contracting (HCC) Capability Assessments<br />- Financial Reviews<br />- Performance Audits</p>
<p><br />QUESTIONS</p>
<p>All questions regarding expressed interest must be submitted in writing by e-mail. Written questions relating to this Request for Information-Sources Sought will be accepted through January 19, 2012. Any communication in reference to this Request for Information-Sources Sought shall cite number 306-RFI-SS-1201 in the SUBJECT Line of an email and be directed to the following e-mail address: CBrown@state.gov and MAhmad@state.gov Failure to place 306-RFI-SS-1201 in the SUBJECT LINE of emails addressing concerns or posing questions may be lost or may not be answered in time before the closing date and time.</p>
<p>NOTICE OF 306-RFI-SS-1201 CLOSING DATE AND TIME</p>
<p>All qualified parties interested in submitting a proposal at a later date, not to surpass 120 days, shall submitted an expression of interest electronically to email address CBrown@state.gov and MAhmad@state.gov not later than 3:00 P.M. Kabul local time on January 26, 2012 Your expressed interest is for a future RFP.</p>
