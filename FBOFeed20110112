The contractor furnished generators will be used to supply low voltage to the breakers located in the power plant switchgear then to the corresponding 2000 kVA transformers.  The transformers will then step the voltage up to 11,000 volts and this medium voltage will be used to feed high voltage breakers at the power plant switchgear.  The synchronized medium voltage buss bar will then provide power to two medium voltage loops feeding substations on the Camp Buehring power grid.  The Government anticipates a site visit (date to be determined) during the solicitation period.<BR>  <BR>This contract will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Priced IDIQ Contract with a base one year period and three one year option periods.

<DESC>Description:<BR><BR>The Army intends to award a noncommercial services bridge Total Maintenance Contract (TMC) for the United States Army Garrison (USAG) Kaiserslautern.  The requirement includes management, personnel, equipment, tools, materials, transportation and other items and/or services relative to maintaining U.S. facilities.  Services will be performed at U.S. Military Installations located in Kaiserslautern, Pirmasens, Miesau and Sembach, within the Federal Republic of Germany.  <BR><BR>The Army will issue a sole source solicitation resulting in a bridge contract with a base period of six months and 2 option periods of 3 months each.  A six month bridge contract is needed to allow the Government sufficient time to award a follow-on TMC contract and to allow for a necessary 90-day phase in period.  The 2 three month option periods will only be used to protect against any unexpected delays in the award of the new contract.  The estimated issue date for the bridge solicitation is 28 February 2011.<BR><BR>Proposed contractor information:<BR><BR>	Contractor:  ITT Federal Services GmbH<BR>		      An Der Welle 3<BR>		      60322 Frankfurt am Main<BR>	Proposed solicitation number:  W912CM-11-R-0007<BR>	Points of Contact:  Karin Price<BR>                                             Jonathan Anderson<BR>	Email:  karin.price1@us.army.mil<BR>                          Jonathan.anderson13@us.army.mil<BR>	Place of Performance:  United States Army Garrison (USAG) Kaiserslautern, Germany<BR>Postal Code:  67657<BR>	Country:  Germany<BR><BR>The current TMC contract, F61521-01-C-3000, expires on 31 March 2011.  The Army is currently preparing for the  follow-on TMC contract.  The follow-on TMC solicitation, W912CM-11-R-0002, will be competed under full and open competition.  It is expected to be released on or about 20 February 2011, with an anticipated award date of 30 June 2011.  The follow-on contract will include a 90-day phase in period and full performance will begin 1 October 2011.  The bridge contract is being awarded to prevent a lapse in service from 31 March 2011 until performance of the follow-on contract begins on 1 October 2011.  The bridge will be awarded sole source because the size and complexity of the requirement necessitate a 90-day phase in period for the mobilization of equipment and materials, personnel assets, as well as the completion of background checks and other administrative procedures required for installation access purposes.  The incumbent contractor, ITT Federal Services, is the only source capable of beginning performance immediately to meet the Government's needs without a significant and unallowable break in service.  Additionally, the investment associated with a requirement of this size and nature cannot be recouped by a new contractor within the short performance time allotted for the bridge contract.  <BR><BR>The bridge solicitation will be issued on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, responsible sources who submit a capability statement or proposal within forty-five days after the publication date of this synopsis will be considered by the Agency.  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>For additional information on the follow-on solicitation, please query W912CM-11-R-0002 on www.fedbizopps.gov.  The Army has posted draft documents for industry review, including a draft Performance Work Statement.  Additional information related to the solicitation will be posted at the same site.  Contract Specialists for the solicitation are Jonathan Anderson  at jonathan.anderson13@us.army.mil or Karin Price at karin.price1@us.army.mil.<BR><BR><BR>

<a href="mailto:Richard.M.Swanson@nasa.gov">Richard M Swanson</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) has a requirement for continuing servicescurrently provided by Lockheed Martin Mission Services (LMMS) under the Space ShuttleLanding and Research Aircraft Support Services Contract (SSLRASS). The primaryrequirement is to provide management and technical personnel to operate, maintain andrepair Space Shuttle landing aids and communications equipment prior to launch, duringspecified on orbit space flight operations and during Shuttle landings at Edwards. NASA/DFRC intends to extend the current fixed price/cost-plus-no fee contract(NND09AA02C) with LMMS for 6 months. The period of performance should provide coveragethrough the end of Program life and Program shutdown. The Space Shuttle Programanticipates retiring the fleet and shutdown of the Program in late 2011.The statutory authority for proceeding with this acquisition using Other Than Full andOpen Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as contemplated by the provision of FAR6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). This provision states that full and open competition need not beprovided for when the services required by the agency are available from only theoriginal source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highlyspecialized services. The provision also states that this exception is applicable when itis likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costto the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or therewould be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. The Space Shuttle Program (SSP) has 2 remaining Space Shuttle missions between now andAugust 2011. To safely complete these last Space Shuttle Missions, all contractualelements associated with the program will be required to perform their missionsflawlessly and without delays. The schedule margin that would be required for acompetitive selection and potentially incorporating a new prime contractor into theProgram would not support the ISS assembly schedule. Competition of the Space Shuttleoperations requirements could lead to the loss of knowledgeable personnel introducingunacceptable risk to the SSP. In addition, because of the transition time required andassociated disruption of the Space Shuttle operations services, there is a potential forincreased safety risks to the orbiter and crew. Because of these considerations,including the unacceptable costs and delays that would be incurred to conduct acompetition and/or select a different prime contractor, the potential benefits fromcompetition do not justify accepting these substantial risks to the Shuttle and ISSprograms. In conclusion, LMMS is the only firm believed to be capable of fulfilling theproposed requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to performthe effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. localtime on January 20, 2011. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely forthe purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitivebasis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a fulland open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within thediscretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<p><br />Contracting Office Address<br />General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service (PBS), 1099 14th Street, NW, 200 W, Washington, DC 20005.</p>
<p>Requirement<br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Rockville, MD, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 50,918 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 44,883 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet (ABOA). The lease term required is for five (5) years with annual termination rights after the third (3rd) year. The space must be available for occupancy by May of 2011. The delineated area is:</p>
<p>North: Wootton Parkway to First Street;<br />East: Route 28 to Veirs Mill Road;<br />South: Randolph Road to Montrose Road;<br />West: North bound side of I-270</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current applicable federal, state, and local government building codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in this transaction. In no event shall a potential Offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized offices and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, CB Richard Ellis, Inc.</p>
<p>Owners, brokers or agents may offer space for consideration. Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Building name, address, and age;<br />2. Available square footage (ANSI/BOMA Office Area, rentable and usable);<br />3. Schedule for completion and occupancy date;<br />4. Rental rate informational quotation per rentable square foot, inclusive of <br />a Tenant Improvement Allowance of $42.08 per ABOA square foot;<br />5. Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space;<br />6. Site Plan showing parking spaces, loading areas, and vehicular circulation;<br />7. Information on project and building ownership.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement. In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide a specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the potential building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements. With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume a maximum rental rate taking into consideration lease prospectus limitations and thresholds in the event the respondent fails to include such information.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest must be in writing and should be forwarded by 3:00 pm (EST) on Wednesday, January 26, 2011 to: <br /><br />CB Richard Ellis, Inc. <br />750 9th Street, NW<br />Washington, DC 20001<br />ATTN: Chad S.

<RESPDATE>012711
<CONTACT>Ann daCruz, Contract Specialist, Phone 7195569475, Fax 7195569464, Email ann.dacruz@peterson.af.mil - Amy Titcombe, Contract Specialist, Phone 7195560643, Fax 7195569464, Email amy.titcombe@peterson.af.mil
<DESC>The Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Directorate, GPS IIR/IIR-M Sustainment, (GPS IIR/IIR-M is the Satellite Block Designation), intends to award a sole-source Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract with a predefined incentive plan with a base period of one year with four one-year options. The estimated contract award date is 31 October 2011. This action will provide continued specialized engineering support and expertise to replace an expiring GPS IIR support contract. The Government has been contracting with Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) for sustainment services for the period of 1 July 2010 to 31 October 2011 on a sole source basis because they have been deemed the only qualified contractor (see details below regarding support services, incentives, and data rights restrictions).
<p>On-Orbit Operations/Sustainment Support: Support for on-orbit operations will begin at contract award and continue through all option years. Support will include daily operations technical support, on-orbit performance data calculations, evaluation and trending, anomaly resolution, flight software upload support, MIL-STD-1750A spacecraft processor and payload processor ADA (US government registered trademark for the programming language that operates the MIL-STD-1750 microprocessor) software builds/maintenance, operation/maintenance Mission Unique software support tools, engineering liaison support to anomaly resolution and related activities necessary to support orbital operations. The Contractor shall update command plans and the Orbital Operations Handbook (OOH) as satellites age and after resolution of on-orbit anomalies to assure integrity of continuing Satellite Vehicle (SV) operations. The OOH contains the specific configurations of each SV and is used to identify changes performed on each SV. The Contractor shall provide for operating, hardware and software maintenance, and security activities of the IIR/IIR-M support systems; Operational Support System (OSS) at Schriever Air Force Base (AFB), CO, Spacecraft Processor Unit/System Test Equipment (SPU/STE) located at Colorado Springs, CO, and the Modernized Telecommunication Simulator (MTS) located at Cape Canaveral AFS, FL. The Contractor will also provide continuing support to the GPS Operational Control Segment ensuring compatibility with the GPS IIR/IIR-M SVs and ensure continuing Space Segment to Control Segment Interface compliance of the IIR/IIR-M SVs, via review, analysis, implementation, test and documentation review of technical changes and incompatibilities. The Contractor shall also support Space Segment to Control Segment integration for all upgrade activities to either segment and ensure command procedures and databases are maintained to support On-Orbit Operations. The estimated staff-hours for this sustainment function are 70,000 per year.</p>
<p>The original Block IIR/IIR-M satellite developer, LMSSC is currently accountable for both negative and positive, performance-based incentives for the on-orbit satellites. On 21 June 1989, the Air Force awarded Contract F04701-89-C-0073 ("GPS IIR contract") to LMSSC. Under that competitively-awarded Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) contract, LMSSC designed, developed, produced, tested and delivered 21 GPS IIR SVs to the GPS Directorate and is currently providing launch support, storage/transportation and on-orbit operations support for those SVs. In addition, terms of that contract include substantial positive and negative on-orbit performance incentives. These incentives are based on 100% availability of both the primary and secondary missions for all satellites. All respondents shall address how the on-orbit performance of these satellites, along with the accountability for all incentives, will be managed to minimize risk to the constellation and ensure no adverse impact to either LMSSC or the Government.</p>
<p>There are restrictions to Government rights to technical data and computer software which LMSSC uses for performance of the current contract. Under the IIR contract, the Government acquired "Limited Rights" to the following items of technical data:<br />1. Tank Vibration Data<br />2. Core Interface Chip (CIC)<br />3. Cross Trap Bus Interface (CBI)<br />4. Memory Error Unit (MEU)<br />5. GPS IIR Transfer Orbit Passive Nutation Damping Analysis<br />6. BGSE Hardware Design Information and Documentation and Software Documentation<br />7. L-Band Antenna Design<br />8. Waveform Generator Design</p>
<p>Under the IIR contract, the Government acquired "Restricted Rights" to the following items of technical data:<br />1. BGSE Software (All Revisions)<br />2. DOCMAN<br />3. MDU Source Code</p>
<p>Therefore, all respondents shall address how they will obtain the necessary data rights or how they will perform the required operational support and sustainment tasks listed above without the limited IIR/IIR-M data rights. Of specific importance is the ability to modify flight software for both the SV Bus and Payload processors in order to resolve anomalies or provide enhanced on-orbit capabilities. Additionally, the ability to update telemetry processing software within the GPS IIR OSS needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>Interested contractors are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) addressing their ability to satisfy the above requirements to SMC SL/PK, Attn: Ann daCruz at ann.dacruz@peterson.af.mil , or Amy Titcombe at amy.titcombe@peterson.af.mil, located at 1050 E. Stewart Avenue, Bldg 2025, Peterson AFB, CO 80914. Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The capabilities statement should address why the company believes that the prior sole source justification is no longer valid. All responses are due no later than close of business, 27 January 2011 and must conform to 8.5 x 11-inch pages, font no smaller than 12-point, 1" margins and a maximum of 20 pages. The SOC must include the following information: 1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact, and telephone numbers; 2) Business size classification (large, small, or other); 3) Description of in-depth experience in GPS Satellites; 4) Description of ability to satisfy the Government's performance requirements described above. SOC must be completely unclassified. All responsible sources may submit a SOC. Persons/entities debarred and/or suspended will not be considered, therefore are not requested to respond.</p>
<p>Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. The NAICS code applicable to this Sources Sought posting is NAICS 517919, All Other Telecommunications: This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station operation. This industry also includes establishments primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems. Establishments providing Internet services or voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services via client-supplied telecommunications connections are also included in this industry; size standard $25M.</p>
<p>A technical evaluation team will review each SOC individually to determine if the firm is capable of performing the required tasks. The technical evaluation team is very knowledgeable in the Sustainment and Operations of the IIR satellite constellation and has been supporting the IIR satellite constellation for 7+ years. The SOCs will be evaluated fairly and with consistency. The Government will review SOCs to determine recency and relevancy on past experience in providing Sustainment and Operations support for GPS Satellite Programs. Recency is considered to be the same or similar work within the past 3 years; relevancy is considered to be work within the field described above. The Government may confirm quality of past performance. While specific IIR experience is not required, it is highly desired, and all respondents must demonstrate recent GPS expertise.</p>
<p>All data received in response to this synopsis that is marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the Government. Government Contract support may be utilized to review any documents submitted in response to this action. Nondisclosure agreements have been signed by Government Contract Support personnel and filed with the Government. The Government will not reimburse any cost associated with submitting information in response to this RFI, nor shall any costs be allowed on any Government contract.</p>
<p>Mr. James Gill, USAF AFSPC SMC/PK, is the Ombudsman and has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call him at (310) 653-1789.</p>

Request for Information

1.0	Introduction
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This action alone will not result in contract award. The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet the VA's requirements.  The VA, Veterans Health Administration, Program Contracting Activity - Central (PCAC) is seeking potential sources to enter into a one year contract with Healthcare Recruitment and Retention Office(HRRO) to recruit the best qualified Hispanic population to keep VA diversified.

The VHA Healthcare Retention and Recruitment Office (HRRO) provides funding and oversight for several student training programs and internships. These internships offer college and graduate-level students on-the-job experience in a variety of clinical and administrative career areas. 

In Executive Order 13171 of October 12, 2000, it was noted that Hispanics remain underrepresented in the Federal workforce so the President affirmed ongoing policies and recommendations to eliminate the underrepresentation, to include providing a plan for recruiting Hispanics that creates a fully diverse workforce for the agency in the 21st century.

 Moreover, it affords them assignments in locations where they normally would not have the opportunity to go. Through these work experiences, the students may gain credit in fulfilling their academic requirements. In addition, VA is given a valuable opportunity to enhance the student's awareness and perceptions of VA as an employer of choice. These student career work experiences help lay the foundation for future VA employment and increase the likelihood of improving representation among VA's Hispanic population. VA is committed to employ a work force that mirrors the minority we serve.

2.0	Scope of Work
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will provide the contractor with copies of documents that the Government is required to provide.

The contractor shall request other government documentation deemed pertinent to the work accomplished directly from the government officials with whom the contractor has contact.  The contractor shall consider the PN/COTR as the final source for need government documentation when the contractor fails to secure the documents by other means.  The contractor is expected to use common knowledge and resourcefulness in securing all other reference materials, standard industry publications, and related materials that are pertinent to the work. The contractor shall maintain frequent communications with designated Veterans Affairs (VA) staff to conduct work in progress reviews. Reproduction of hand-out material (if applicable) will be forwarded to HRRO to reproduce.

The VHA Healthcare Retention and Recruitment Office (HRRO) seeks to recruit highly-qualified (minimum 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale), Hispanic-American student interns through the wide array of resources available to a Hispanic-American serving organization.

<CONTACT>Laura McGoldrick, Contract Negotiator, Phone (937) 255-0405, Email laura.mcgoldrick@wpafb.af.mil - Jamie Hoff, Project Engineer, Phone (937) 255-9863, Email jamie.hoff@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR THE READ OUT INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (ROIC) FOUNDRY IMPROVEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY PROJECT. Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/RXM) is contemplating a procurement to improve upon and sustain domestic capability of manufacturing 0.18um ROICs on 8" wafers in order to ensure access to this critical technology. The government intends to release a solicitation for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), "Only One Responsible Source." The government contemplates the award of a Technology Investment Agreement (with cost share) for this requirement to Jazz Semiconductor, 4321 Jamboree Rd, Newport Beach, CA 92660, for the program entitled "Read Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC) Foundry Improvement and Sustainability Project".
<p>There are a number of challenges related to the design and fabrication of ROICs. As detector arrays grow in size and numbers of pixels per array, the complexity of the ROIC also increases and adds to the challenges of the foundry that must now utilize advanced CMOS processing techniques with competitive wafer sizes (e.g., 8 inches). To achieve the necessary radiation hardening, more circuitry must be contained in each ROIC cell and ability of each cell to provide adequate storage capacitance is made more difficult as cell size decreases. Other factors affect the design, processing and performance of ROICS for space qualified arrays. The ROIC must exhibit very low noise to avoid contributing substantially to the noise of the sensor. Defect density in the ROIC reduces yield during manufacture and may affect the operability of the sensor once it is hybridized. For large format (LF) arrays, "stitching" may be required because of the limitations of lithography equipment.</p>
<p>The goal of this program is to ensure that there is a domestic supplier capable and willing to provide qualified ROIC's for space systems deemed useful for U.S. Government space applications with an emphasis on efforts related to yield improvements. The vendor will identify steps that may be taken to improve yield rates related to U.S. Government space programs for large and small format devices used in cryogenic, non-cryogenic, and radiation applications. The vendor will identify where efforts and resources are best applied to obtain the greatest value related to improvements in yield for these applications.</p>
<p>Under the contemplated contract action, the vendor shall have prior experience with and be able to maintain existing domestic manufacturing capability for 0.18um ROIC's on 8" wafers, while addressing the aforementioned yield improvements. It is estimated that the sole source Technology Investment Agreement will be awarded for $5,225,000.00. Vendors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above not later than 3:00 PM, Eastern Daylight Time, on the fifteenth day after publication of this synopsis. Responses must be submitted to Louis M. Nyikon, Contracting Officer, via email at Louis.Nyikon@wpafb.af.mil. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. Responses shall be no more than ten (10) pages in length. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches; foldouts are permitted but will be assessed towards total page count. Pages shall be single-spaced, single-sided. The font shall be Times New Roman and the font size shall be no less than twelve (12) point. Margins for each page shall be at least 1-inch on the top and bottom and &frac34;-inch side margins. Submitting your company brochure is not an adequate response. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be submitted in response to this Notice; if so, clearly mark any such proprietary data. Responses should include the following information within the ten (10) page limit:</p>
<p>1. Vendor Information, to include:<br />a. Company Name<br />b. Address<br />c. Phone Number<br />d. Fax Number<br />e. E-mail Address<br />f. Point-of-Contact Information</p>
<p>2. Description of relevant capability to produce 0.18um ROICs on 8" wafers for military applications.</p>
<p>Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are available at www.fbo.gov. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This Notice of Contracting Action does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or Request for Quote (RFQ), nor does this Notice restrict the Government's acquisition approach. Any information received in response to this Notice will be considered to constitute market research and may be utilized by the AF in developing its acquisition strategy. This market research will be used to assess the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing any solicitation. The Government will not respond to or provide formal debriefings as a result of this Notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of a response to this Notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the planned contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Direct questions to the contract point of contact identified in the announcement. Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency. See Numbered Note 22.*****</p>

In response to this operational need and an aging fleet of assault amphibious vehicles, the Marine Corps requirement for an amphibious tracked vehicle that will provide force protection, water speed, land mobility, lethality and survivability, while balancing payload, mobility, transportability and total ownership costs over the current Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) is enduring.  As such, the Marine Corps is conducting an amphibious requirements review in order to explore more affordable solutions to replace the aging AAV.
 

Additionally, the Marine Corps has a requirement to provide a medium lift combat capability to support sustained operations ashore.  This requirement for a Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC); an advanced generation, eight-wheeled, armored personnel carrier, must also provide force protection, land mobility, lethality, and survivability while balancing payload, mobility, transportability and total ownership costs. 

With this in mind, the Marine Corps is developing both interim and long-term investment strategies and plans and will release three (3) Requests for Information (RFIs) as follows:  (1)  for an AAV upgrade to serve as an interim solution, (2) for a Marine Personnel Carrier, and (3) for an AAV replacement.
  Marine Corps Systems Command and Program Executive Office Land Systems (PEO LS) in coordination with Combat Development and Integration (CD&I) intends to release these RFIs in the near future.  These RFIs will serve to obtain industry input relative to its ability to provide affordable materiel solutions and inform the timeframe to provide upgrades to the AAV, develop and field an MPC and replace the AAV.

<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br /><br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) form, rather than filing a protest within the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest must be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the time period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: 202-372-3695<br />Fax: 202-472-3904</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 01 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR DC-8Fuel Tank Inspection and Repair. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as theofficial amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued.The purpose of this amendment is to post questions and answers about solicitation Question 1.  What hours and number of consecutive days will the aircraft be madeavailable to contractor during the inspection (Item 1), and then during the repair cycle(Items 2 and 3)?Answer 1. The aircraft will be located within a hangar and will be available between thehours of 0700 and 1900 daily to include weekends.  These access hours will be availabledaily to include weekends until the leak check and repairs are complete.  Question 2. What is the projected fuel load of aircraft for tank leak inspection?Answer 2. The fuel load will be the minimum required to move between tanks and adequatelyleak check all tanks.  The fuel load required is estimated to be between 80,000 lbs and120,000 lbs.  Fuel for this effort is provided by the government.Question 3. Will defuel of aircraft commence immediately following leak check inspection?Answer 3. Yes, once the contractor is complete with checking and documenting leaks ineach tank then the government maintenance team will defuel and de-puddle the aircraftfuel tanks.Question 4. Reference Statement of Work, page 3 section 7:4a. Will GFI include removals of external panels and fairing in support of leakinspection?Answer 4a. The government maintenance team will work with the contractor to determine theminimum panels to be removed to support investigation of leaks.  4b. Is there a list of planned removal items in support of this element or shouldcontractor submit preferred removal listing to support inspection?Answer 4b. The contractor should submit a list of minimum panels to be removed to supportleak checks. During the leak check effort then additional panels will be removed asrequired to investigate suspected leak areas.Question 5.

Reference Statement of Work, Section 2:In regards to contract pricing, do materials to be included in hourly rate includesealant, o-rings, hi-locks, nuts, washers, alodine, primer, etc. and expendable itemssuch as rags, brushes, acetone, etc. to be utilized during the repair cycle? Answer 6. Labor rate shall be fully burdened and shall include any travel and lodgingcosts, if applicable.  Materials pricing should be handled separately from labor once therepairs are defined and all associated required materials defined.Question 7.  Considering the short period of execution for the work, what happens if weget in to thetanks and they require substantial repair? Answer 7.    At this time, the Government is requesting a firm fixed price for theinspection portion of the tanks  only.  We realize that it would be extremely difficult to provide a FFP forthe repair until the inspection has been completed, therefore, we are only asking for thehourly labor rate that would be charged for the repair.  After the successful offeror hascompleted the inspection and provided the inspection report, the Government will thenrequest the contractor to provide a FFP for the repair  using the hourly labor ratequoted in the solicitation  and knowing the extent of the repair needed and thematerials required.  At that point the Government will determine if it is cost effective,or feasible, to exercise the option to repair the tank or to pursue other action.The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 1/13/2011.

The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror. The Government intends to award without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. The following listed are evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process: <br />6a) Price<br />6b) Technical Capability: Technical Acceptability is achieved when the offeror provides proof that the products meet the minimum standards and are in compliance with the grade of the products specified, based on product literature/description (i.e., products brochures and/or products catalog data).<br />All offerors shall submit technical description of the products being offered in sufficient detail in addition to the price proposal, to evaluate compliance with the requirements in this solicitation.</p>

Incomplete or unreasonable offers shall be rejected and elmiminated from further consideration. A single award will result from this evaluation. If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical capability as defined in above paragraph (a)2, a Purchase Order will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptable capability, the Government will then go to the next low offeror in the same manner if they meet the technical capability. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical acceptable capability in ascending order of the low price.</p>
<p>7) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p><br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Description:</p>
<p>1. The Satellite Control and Network Directorate (SCN) of the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) are exploring candidate approaches for Radio Frequency Interference monitoring (RFI). The RFI Monitoring system is a necessary subsystem that provides a data collection method to enhance the requirement for RF protection of the ground segments, whether fixed or transportable.</p>
<p>2. To help SMC/SCN determine the availability of such systems capable of RFI monitoring, the Government requests information from industry on related Commercial-off-The Shelf (COTS) systems or modified COTS systems to support the Government's objectives. The Government is currently seeking industry input on RFI monitoring solutions.</p>
<p>3. The Government has identified the following minimum parameters for a successful RFI monitoring system. At each of multiple geographically separated locations, the objective RFI monitoring system will:</p>
<p>a. Provide a method or technique to detect and identify each RFI signal that is above the local measured RF environment established baseline, within the specified spectrum<br />b. Provide a method or technique to measure the RFI signal characteristics <br />c. Provide RFI direction, with no increase in personnel at a given site <br />d. Provide a method or technique to collect RFI data electronically and send the RFI data with alarm condition to a central network management location <br />e. Provide a method or technique to detect and discriminate between unintentional emissions and undocumented emitters in the approved spectrum<br />f. Provide a method or technique to collect RFI data, including anomalous conditions, that must be in a format that can be forwarded to other, external organizations <br />g.

<DESC>MRAP VISUAL SENSOR MARKET SURVEY<BR><BR>A.  DESCRIPTION OF INTENT<BR> <BR>The Program Executive Office Combat Systems and Combat Service Support (PEO CS&CSS), Joint Program Office Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle (JPO MRAP) <BR><BR>is conducting a market survey to collect written information from Industry to ascertain the current market's capability to integrate visual sensors onto the <BR><BR>MRAP family of vehicles.<BR><BR>The Army seeks to improve situational awareness for Warfighters within the MRAP vehicle.  This situational awareness system requires an upgrade to the <BR><BR>current suite of visual sensors to increase visibility of the surrounding environment.<BR><BR>The parameters of the desired visual sensor cameras are as follows:  <BR><BR>The visual sensors must contain both a daytime color and infrared visualization capability.  It is assumed that each sensor includes two cameras: one for <BR><BR>color daytime capability and one for infrared capability.  If a single camera can accomplish both capabilities simultaneously, references to separate cameras <BR><BR>can be assumed to apply to the single camera.  Both cameras must have a horizontal Field of View (FOV) no less than 40 degrees; and, a vertical FOV no less <BR><BR>than 30 degrees. The daytime color camera must detect an upright, stationary adult in fair weather no less than 180 meters away; and, the infrared camera <BR><BR>must do the same no less than 250 meters away.  The sensor must reside upon a mechanical pan-tilt system with a pan range of no less than 360 degrees <BR><BR>(continuous) and tilt range of at least +90 / -30 degrees elevation.  The daytime color camera must output analog video in accordance with SMPTE-170M-2004 <BR><BR>with a minimum resolution of 768V x 494H; whereas, the infrared camera must output analog video in accordance with SMPTE-170M-2004 with a minimum resolution <BR><BR>of 640V x 480H.  The sensor unit must provide a serial control interface via RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485 half duplex; and, the pan-tilt unit must provide a <BR><BR>control bus interface via RS-485 half duplex.  The sensor and pan-tilt unit must have Built-In Test (BIT) capability for fault detection/isolation. The <BR><BR>latency from either camera must not exceed 35 milliseconds from point of image capture to distribution on a video or data network.  The sensor unit must be <BR><BR>ruggedized to military standards.<BR><BR>Respondents should be companies that have proven capabilities as a vehicle system integrator and can ruggedize sensor technologies to military standards.  <BR><BR>This survey is not intended to address individual technologies, rather we are interested in the sensor package as a whole that meets all parameters above.    <BR><BR>This survey does not aim to address immature technological capabilities.  Respondents should include information regarding production readiness and <BR><BR>justification of stated capabilities.<BR><BR>B.  GENERAL INFORMATION<BR><BR>The submission of information in response to this market survey is for planning purposes only; and, it must not be construed as a commitment by the United <BR><BR>States Government to procure any items or services described herein, or for the Government to pay for the information received.<BR><BR>Respondents that cannot address all of the market survey questions in this RFI need not respond.  Receipt of an incomplete market survey will not be <BR><BR>reviewed.<BR><BR>***UNITED STATES (US) AND FOREIGN COMPANIES WHO WISH TO RESPOND TO THIS SURVEY SHALL BE AWARE OF AND BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH EXPORT CONTROLS IN ACCORDANCE <BR><BR>WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN ARMS REGULATIONS.***<BR><BR>Participation in this market survey is strictly voluntary and the U.S. Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for their <BR><BR>participation in this survey.

The facility program calls for a new museum building of approximately 330,000 gross square feet which will be a place of collaboration with museums and other organizations to promote the study and appreciation of African American life and its impact on the nation and the world. The new museum will include exhibition galleries, performance and public program spaces, a theater, food service, and retail. Non-public spaces will include a loading dock, collections handling and work rooms, administrative offices, and support spaces. The design will incorporate state-of the-art technologies for exhibits, research, and communications, and the new facility is planned to achieve LEED Gold certification. The Smithsonian anticipates awarding a contract for pre-construction services by mid 2011 and commencing of site preparation activity in late 2011. The Smithsonian expects contractor turnover of the building for the installation of exhibits starting in late 2014 and the new museum will open to the public in November 2015 to coincide with symbolic moments in the narrative of American history.</p>
<p>The selected CMc shall provide Pre-construction Phase Services and Construction Phase Services through a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) agreement. Total period of performance including Pre-construction and Construction is estimated to be from notice to proceed in April 2011 to substantial completion in November 2014. The estimated construction cost is between $240,000,000 and $290,000,000. Critical elements of the work include, but are not limited to; pre-construction services, site work, utility work, excavation, sheeting &amp; shoring (slurry wall), foundations, dewatering, concrete and steel super-structure, landscape and hardscape, high level architectural finishes (both interior and exterior), MEP systems, elevators, roofing, exterior curtain wall with unique fa&ccedil;ade treatment, food service equipment, and theater specialties. Additional requirements for performance include: procedures and documentation to ensure compliance with the established LEED building criteria; practices, procedures and documentation related to integrated building commissioning; and knowledge of procedures for the use of BIM.</p>
<p>Firm evaluation and selection will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Best Value Procurement, utilizing a two-step procurement model. Step I of the RFP will consist of a list of prequalifying criteria to assist the agency in identifying those CMc contractors that have demonstrated past specialized experience in comparable and non-comparable CMc projects and other relevant qualifying factors. It is the Smithsonian's intent to advance the most highly qualified companies for further consideration under Step II, technical and pricing evaluation of the RFP. Companies which are advanced to Step II of the RFP will be evaluated in accordance with the technical criteria as set forth in the RFP</p>

<DESC>MEDCOM, Western Regional Contracting Office, Tacoma, WA intends to award a firm fixed priced award under FAR Part 6.302-1 to Alcon Laboratories for maintenance service for the Cataract Extraction Unit. This base plus four option year award is anticipated to be $32,167.00. Service and parts are proprietary to the Cataract Extraction Unit by Alcon Laboratories. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
