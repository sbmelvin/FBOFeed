<DESC>NASA/Johnson Space Center (JSC) has a requirement for critical performance datafrom an integrated flight test of the Orion spacecraft as part of the Orion MultipurposeCrew Vehicle (MPCV) Design, Development, Test and Evaluation (DDT&E) phase.   The Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) is an early flight test, planned for early 2014,of the Orion spacecraft that is currently being developed by Lockheed Martin SpaceSystems Corporation (LMSSC), Denver, Colorado under contract NNJ06TA25C.  The Orionspacecraft is a crew vehicle for missions beyond low-Earth orbit and will be launched onNASAs Space Launch System (SLS), which is expected to have a first flight in December2017.  The EFT-1 flight test of the Orion spacecraft is intended to facilitate earlier and morerobust testing of critical Orion spacecraft systems that contribute to 10 of the 16highest risks to crew survivability and exploration mission failure.  The requirements ofEFT-1 support early risk reduction of Orions critical systems by providing informationneeded for Loss of Crew (LOC) and Loss of Mission (LOM) assessments during an un-mannedtwo orbit, high apogee high-energy entry flight test.  This early orbital flight test iskey to providing early test data that is critical to influence design decisions andvalidate Orion spacecraft systems in flight environments that cannot be duplicated on theground.  Conducting this test before the Orion Critical Design Review mitigatesspacecraft DDT&E cost and schedule risks, and enables the final Orion spacecraft designto support the Exploration Mission 1 scheduled to occur in December 2017 on the SLS.EFT-1 flight test objectives are focused on demonstrating beyond low earth orbit (BEO)spacecraft capabilities.  The flight conditions required for EFT-1 were selected todemonstrate integrated vehicle performance for ascent, on-orbit flight, and a high-energyre-entry profile of approximately 30,280 feet per second from BEO. This trajectory willprovide two orbital revolutions with an inertial entry interface velocity of nearly 84%of lunar re-entry velocity to stress the entry, descent, and landing functions, includingthe heat shield, propulsion, guidance/navigation/control and parachute recovery systems. The flight test specifically will address risk mitigation of the largest contributors toLOC and LOM risks through demonstration of high energy re-entry performance determinationof the heatshield Thermal Protection System, Forward Bay Cover deployment and othercritical separation events, drogue and main parachute deployment, crew module up-rightingsystem deployment, and launch abort system (LAS) jettison.  Other objectives critical tomitigate development risk are demonstration of on-orbit control via the power, Guidance,Navigation and Control (GN&C) and reaction control systems, and the ground to spacecraftcommunications and tracking.  The test flight will incorporate specific elements andselected system capabilities that will provide critical integrated vehicle data to thesystems designers that otherwise would be unavailable until the planned December 2017fully integrated flight with NASAs SLS.To accomplish the EFT-1 objectives, NASA plans to expand the scope of the existing Orioncontract.  The EFT-1 flight test utilizes an early production variant of the Orionspacecraft which is comprised of four elements: the Orion launch abort system, crewmodule, service module, and spacecraft adapter and fairings.  The Orion contractor iscurrently developing these four elements under the existing contract.  The additionalscope required is to integrate the spacecraft with the launch system, along with otherunique integration efforts between this integrated stack and the ground and operationssystems.  The contractor also will be responsible for providing the launch service,including a launch vehicle capable of lifting the spacecraft into a highly lofted orbitto achieve the high energy reentry requirement.  The primary deliverable for this effortwill be the flight test data and engineering evaluation of the test results against theformal flight test objectives established by NASA.  NASA/JSC intends to procure this additional scope for the integrated flight test on asole-source basis from LMSSC, Denver Colorado, via a modification of the Orion contract. This decision is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no othersupplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, which implements the authority of10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  As the developer of the Orion spacecraft, LMSSC possesses the required technicalunderstanding of the integrated spacecraft design and its predicted responses in adynamic coupled environment with a launch system.  This knowledge is critical tounderstanding how both vehicles must work in unison during the flight phases of launch,on-orbit maneuvering and de-orbit return in order for the Orion spacecraft to accomplishand test the objectives of EFT-1.  LMSSC is uniquely positioned to assess prelaunchpredictions for integrated spacecraft/launch vehicle loads, thermal, flight control, andseparation dynamics, and then deconstruct the post-flight data for quick applicationtoward design/development updates to the Orion spacecraft.  Also, LMSSC is the only contractor with the systems level knowledge of the Orion designnecessary to perform the integrated systems analyses activity that will be required tointegrate the spacecraft with the launch system to meet the EFT-1 objectives.  Thesesystems analyses and integration activities are needed to mate the EFT-1 spacecraft witha launch system.  Further, a detailed understanding of the unique Orion spacecraftinterfaces and environmental drivers is required.  Issuance of this sole-source contractaction will permit NASA to accomplish its unique technical and schedule requirements forthe EFT-1 objectives.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon November 22, 2011.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

The Naval Weapons System Support - Mechanicsburg, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for the issuance of a single award, unique source contract to acquire Engineering Support services in support of the Commander Naval Air System Command, Patuxent River, MD.

A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract is contemplated for an approximate period of performance of eight months and the proposed contractor is Innova Systems International, 2385 Northside Drive, Suite 300, San Diego, CA 92108. Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
A justification and approval will be posted at a later date.

PMA-205GT is responsible for Naval Aviation Training Systems.
  

The requirement provides a critical enhancement to Naval Aviations primary Operations and Readiness management systems, the Sierra Hotel Aviation Readiness 
Program (SHARP) and the Air Combat Training System (ACTS), required for successfulInitial Operational Capability (IOC) of the P-8A Poseidon aircraft, at Acquisition Category I 
(ACAT I) program.  The requirement provides benefits to Naval Aviation as a whole.  

The purpose of this requirement is to allow the transfer of unclassified training data between the unclassified SHARP system and the classified ACTS.  This is a long standing requirement, first identified as an unfunded, but required enhancement in 2008.  This requirement has been identified as critical to the successful introduction of the P-8A Poseidon aircraft in early 2013.
  The systems have already been installed in the P-8 Training System Support Center (TSSC), and the requirement to manually transfer training completion data has proven to significantly hinder transition training progress, which has already begun.  Currently, information documenting the successful completion of classified training, which is pre-requisite to syllabus training missions scheduled in the unclassified system , must be entered by hand, unacceptably slowing the ability to manage new aircraft transition training.  This requirement will permit the vendor to engage the services of the Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) to engineer a subscriber service with DISA to allow the passage of pre-approved data between DoD classified and unclassified networks in accordance with United States Navy Cyber Forces Command and DoD information assurance policies.
  
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
 However, all proposals received by closing date will be considered by the government. A determination of the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<RESPDATE>122211
<CONTACT>ETADEFRFI Mailbox, Email ETADEFRFI@dtra.mil
<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought Notice / Request for Information (RFI). There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for Solicitation and inquiries related to the same will not receive a response. This RFI is published for market research purposes only, and in no way obligates the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise make a contract award. Any and all information submitted in response to this&nbsp;RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI.<br /><strong><br />Background<br /></strong><br />The Joint Science and Technology Office of the Chemical and Biological Defense Program (JSTO-CBD) was established as part of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under the April 2003 memorandum, "Implementation Plan for the Management of the Department of Defense Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP)," signed by the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&amp;L). The JSTO-CBD science and technology programs address basic and applied research and experimental development related to chemical and biological threat agent characterization, medical diagnostic methods and medical pre-treatment and therapeutic countermeasures, and physical decontamination, detection, protection, and decision support capabilities.<br /><br />The February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) states that, "... to deter adversaries considering the use of chemical or biological weapons, the Department will enhance efforts to develop countermeasures, defenses, and mitigation strategies...to meet, defend, and defeat these emerging threats." The QDR also specifically calls out the need to conduct research on countermeasures and to develop technologies against <em>non-traditional chemical agents</em>.<br /><strong><br />Objective<br /></strong><br />This RFI addresses the segments of the current JSTO-CBD portfolio that are concerned with developing a scientific understanding of <em>emerging and potential</em> chemical and biological (CB) threat agents, and the application of science and technology towards the development of physical and medical countermeasure capabilities against the threat posed by such agents. This is a market survey to determine the existing infrastructure and personnel resources capable of performing both theoretical and practical hazardous material defense related research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E).<br /><br />Any RDT&amp;E work conducted related to this objective will require performers that have cleared personnel, secure facilities, and laboratories certified by government authorities for hazardous work. Work performed and data created under potential efforts will, in many cases, be subject to government issued security classification guides and will have to be conducted and prepared in accordance with established guidelines for laboratory safety and information security. In addition, if the hazardous materials to be investigated meet certain criteria, surety agent handling and accountability rules will have to be followed. These requirements may include: laboratories, animal facilities and glove boxes with appropriate engineering controls, current inspection/calibration standards, alarm systems, contamination controls; hazard assessment and analysis plans; defined standard operating procedures; appropriate training programs; personal protective equipment (PPE); the ability to meet or exceed established occupational health guidelines; provision of onsite medical treatment; validated decontamination plans; robust detection and monitoring systems; appropriate emergency response plans; physical security; accountability; onsite transportation plans; and an established personnel reliability program (PRP) or its equivalent.<br /><strong><br />Responses<br /></strong><br />Sources having the capability and/or concept to meet these requirements are invited to respond to this RFI.<br /><br />Responses must be UNCLASSIFIED and limited to five (5) pages for any given concept, not including cover page, cover letter and table of contents. Respondents will be expected to follow their internal information security policies and any appropriate internal or government supplied security guidance to insure that responses to this RFI are UNCLASSIFIED. Any proprietary concepts of information should be clearly identified as such with disposition instructions. Data and information submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DTRA from non-government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact, contact information and known or anticipated OCI issues.<br /><br />Each response should address the following:<br /><br />&bull; Status and/or capability of the submitter's facility clearance (DD Form 441 or equivalent) or relevant international disclosure mechanism for sharing classified information -at the SECRET level- with the United States, and a facility CAGE Code or SECRET-level safeguarding capability that can be verified by the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD) at the time of award.<br />&bull; List and detailed description of positions with (and capable of maintaining) SECRET-level personnel security clearances including areas of expertise and level of training.<br />&bull; Description of all laboratory (physical and life science [<em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em>]), test and computer facilities available for physical and medical countermeasure RDT&amp;E with the spectrum of novel and emerging threat agents at both the UNCLASSIFIED and SECRET levels.<br />&bull; Description of all laboratory and facility safety and security procedures (i.e. Biological Safety Levels, Bio-surety, Chemical Surety, personnel reliability program and/or its equivalent, etc.)<br /><br />Only electronic submissions of information provided to the email address specified will be accepted. RFI responses should be sent to the following email address: <a href="mailto:ETADEFRFI@dtra.mil">ETADEFRFI@dtra.mil</a>. All emails should include in the subject line the RFI number and the submitting organization's name. Responses should be submitted electronically not later than 5:00 p.m. EST on December 22, 2011.<br /><br /><strong>Additional Information<br /></strong><br />Upon review of all submissions in response to this RFI, DTRA may schedule individual meetings with any or all respondents to gain further understanding into their specific responses.</p>

<DESC>"Liver Tissue Cell Distribution System"
<p>"This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>Background. NIDDK's mission is to conduct and support research on many chronic and costly diseases affecting the public health. To facilitate the understanding of disease processes affecting the liver, NIDDK supports basic research, by contracting with an organization to provide scientists with liver tissue and the cells needed. The contract seeks to facilitate the distribution of discarded liver tissue to qualified investigators from USA regional centers that have active liver transplant programs with human subjects' consent to provide portions of the explanted pathologic. Frozen or fresh tissue from a variety of childhood and adult liver diseases (cirrhosis, fulminate liver failure, chronic rejection, and certain inborn errors of metabolism, etc.) are desired in order to stimulate research on liver diseases. Recipients of cells and tissue from diseased livers are primarily investigators whose projects have been vetted by the NIDDK grant process. Supplies of isolated hepatocytes from "normal" liver currently dictate that these are provided only to NIH investigators.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of this requirement is to provide the National Institute on Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases with clinical and biological laboratory support, order management services, and technical biological and financial reporting for the Liver Tissue Cell Distribution System.</p>
<p>Project requirements. This requirement consists of several different functions. Clinical and biological laboratory support consists of maintaining a stable source of liver tissue donation, providing medical histories for donors of individual tissue, performing histology, cell isolation and purification, tracking cell viability and tissue preservation. Order Management consists of receiving orders for tissue and cells, reviewing and prioritizing requests from the supply of cells available, tracking filled orders , maintaining tissue and cell fee schedules, processing subscriber fees, cell/tissue payments, and reimbursement for livers and unviable cells. Reporting is needed for three contract activities: (a) biotechnical processing of tissue, (b) LCTDS Coordinating Committee<br />and (c) cost accounting. Technical biological reporting involves providing medical histories for tissue that are as complete as donation circumstances allow and tracking the technical quality/viability of cell and tissue preparations. LCTDS Coordinating Committee reporting involves user demographics and cell use, monitoring recipients' satisfaction with the service delivered, suggesting process improvements, and providing feasibility information to the project officer for strategic decision-making. Financial reporting involves collecting and disseminating information on the financial cost of procuring tissue, keeping accounts current for subscribers, posting payments for subscribers' cell and tissue orders, and preparing monthly invoices. This effort requires a team with considerable expertise in hepatology, histology, and cell culture techniques. Also needed is experience in information technology systems and financial reporting.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance. It is anticipated that the period of performance will be for five years beginning approximately July 2012.</p>
<p>Capability statements/information sought. Respondents must submit a capability statement that demonstrates the potential offeror's qualification, experience, and expertise, specifically providing evidence for the following: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.</p>
<p><br />Interested offerors must submit five (5) hard copies of their capability statement. This should be limited to fifteen (15) pages. Each respondent should include their DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.</p>
<p>The intention of this announcement is to survey the market for potential offerors. No large businesses should respond to this announcement. All interested small businesses including veteran-owned small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women- owned small business concerns must provide copies of their capability statement on or before November 17, 2011 at 12:00pm Eastern time to Ms. Christine Biser, Contract Specialist, NIDDK Acquisitions Branch, Two Democracy Plaza, Suite 700W, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, MSC 5455, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-5455.

<DESC>BACKGROUND: The Common Remotely-Operated Weapon System Model XM153 (CROWS XM153) is a stabilized mount that contains a sensor suite and fire control software that enables Soldiers to acquire and engage targets from inside an armor-protected vehicle. Remote operation provides armored protection from direct enemy fire. The CROWS adapts to four standard weapons, the M2, MK19, M240, and M249. CROWS is available in two configurations: the Fire Control Unite (FCU) and the Display and Control Panel (DCP). The FCU configuration houses the display, controls, and processing technology and is the original CROWS configuration. The DCP configuration allows CROWS to be mounted in vehicles with limited space and separates the display and controls from the Main Processing Unit (MPU).<br><br>

<p><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD:</strong> The Government will award a contract resulting from this announcement to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. DFAS reserves the right to issue an order to a vendor for reasons other than the lowest price. To permit a thorough and effective evaluation, the quote should be as concise, complete and clear as possible so as to permit the Government to make evaluation of the quote without further information being required from the quoter. Inclusion of any important consideration not covered by this request is encouraged.

The information submitted should reflect an experience in similar types of contracts. Preference will be given to quoters who have provided similar services at a DFAS Government installation or familiarity with Government finance and accounting operations.

<p>Certificate of Maintainability:</p>
<p>At such time as the services of the Contractor are terminated, expire contractually or are otherwise not extended, or upon request by the Contracting Officer at any time, the Contractor shall issue, within five (5) working days, a "Certificate of Maintainability" for any or all equipment acquired and/or maintained under this contract. The certificate shall state that preventive maintenance in accordance with the specifications of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has been performed and that the equipment is performing in accordance with the OEM's specifications such that the OEM (or the OEM's successor in interest) would commit that it would assume maintenance of the equipment without billing any one-time charges (including but not limited to repair or inspection charges) if such maintenance were assumed effective the day after the Contractor's performance ceases. The Contractor is responsible for bearing all costs associated with obtaining such certification at no separate charge to the Government. Should the Contractor fail to issue the required Certificate of Maintainability in accordance with this clause, or should any equipment fail to perform in accordance with the certification, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any reasonable costs incurred by the Government for the purpose of bringing the equipment up to the required OEM maintenance level. If equipment is acquired under this contract, without maintenance of such equipment being concurrently acquired under the contract, the Contractor shall issue a Certificate of Maintainability for such equipment at the time of delivery for each piece of equipment. The certificate shall state that the equipment is in such condition that the OEM (or the OEM's successor in interest) would commit that it would assume maintenance of the equipment without billing any charges to the Government. All charges required to obtain the requisite performance of the equipment, up to the later of the time the equipment is accepted by the Government or the warranty expires, shall be borne by the Contractor. The time the equipment is accepted by the Government is the date that the Government determines that the equipment has passed acceptance testing, not the effective date of acceptance. The fact that the equipment may have been acquired with a warranty does not relieve the Contractor of its obligations under this clause.</p>

 3. Price: Award will be made to the offeror that proposes the lowest price and is determine to be technically acceptable.
 
 (d) Procedures:
 
 All offerors will be required to prepare and submit their complete proposal submission in accordance with the proposal preparation instructions in Provision 52.212-1 of this request for proposal.  Proposals and other information will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria stated in this provision

(e) EVALUATION APPROACH

1. TECHNICAL:

(i) Assessment: The offeror's proposal shall, as a minimum, address each of the technical proposal criteria as they apply to the SOW.  During evaluations of each proposal, the Government will assess each area of the Technical Proposal to ensure the offeror meets or exceeds the standards of the contract.  The Government will evaluate the technical proposal based on the evaluation criteria described in Section A through C below, which are tailored to specific principal tasks in the SOW.  The Government will infer from the offeror's responses to these specified evaluation criteria the offeror's capability to perform to the requirements of the entire SOW.  In order to be considered for award, the offeror must demonstrate the ability to provide adequate and qualified staff and expertise to satisfy the statement of work requirements by describing or providing the information requested below:

The evaluation of the technical proposal will consider the following:

A) Contractor personnel shall be trained and qualified to work on all components of the patient lifting devices for a minimum of 3 years. 

B) Contractor personnel shall provide proof of successful completion of training and certification by the manufacturer (Arjo).

C) Contractor shall provide, upon request, evidence of appropriate training of any field service representatives including subcontractors providing services under the terms of this contract.

2.  PAST PERFORMANCE:
 
(i) Factor Assessment: The purpose of Past Performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government will have in an Offeror's ability to provide services that meet customer needs.  The Past Performance evaluation will assess how relevant the Offeror's contracts on previous efforts of similar size and scope to this acquisition have been rated by their customers.  The evaluation will focus on and target performance that is relevant to the principal tasks of the SOW, (i.e. providing annual preventive maintenance services for Patient Lifting Devices stated in the SOW).   More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the performance confidence assessment than less recent and/or less relevant effort.  A performance confidence rating will be assigned based on the offeror's ability to perform the requirements of this solicitation

 (ii)  Description of factor:

(A) The Government will conduct a past performance review of each competitive offeror.  Evaluations will be based on present and past performance information provided by the Offeror and gathered from various sources.  In addition to the information provided by the Offeror's customers, the Government reserves the right to use data obtained from other Government and commercial sources.

(B) Recent:  A contract is considered recent when performance of the effort is ongoing or has been completed within the past 3 years.  Current performance will have a greater impact in the confidence assessment than less recent performance.  

(C) Relevancy:  The government will perform an independent determination of data relevancy, provided or obtained.  The main assessment of relevancy focuses on capability and magnitude.  Capability assesses whether the work being performed in the reference is similar to the work in our requirement.  Magnitude defines whether the amount of work in the reference is similar to the amount of work in our requirement.  An effort is considered relevant when there is a logical connection with document destruction services.  The scope of past performance information in value and size shall also be considered in determining relevancy.   More relevant performance will have a greater impact on the confidence assessment than less relevant effort.

(D) Performance:  The government will perform an independent determination for each contract reference, provided or obtained.  

(iii) A lack of relevant past performance information shall be rated as an unknown performance risk, having no positive or negative significance.  A strong record of relevant or semi-relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than a "Neutral/Unknown confidence" rating.  Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance.   

(v) Where the performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems.  The Government will also consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised) to resolve problems.  Offerors will have the opportunity to address any negative or adverse past performance information received during this evaluation (subject to the restrictions of FAR 15.306 (e) (4), for which they have not had an opportunity to address in the past.

3. PRICE:

(i) Factor Assessment:  This criteria evaluates the overall price (i.e. aggregate for all two years of performance) to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.  The Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the proposed prices are materially unbalanced which is defined as significantly understated or overstated in relation to the actual cost of that work or when the price is determined not to be fair and reasonable.    The individual unit prices listed in Price Schedule will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed by FAR 15.404-1(b).

(ii) Ratings:  Price proposals will be evaluated, but not rated.

(iii) Description of factor:  The Government will conduct a price review of each contract line item.  Evaluations will be based on a comparison of the aggregate price of all offerors.  The aggregate price is the sum of all two years for contract line items 0001 through 1001.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Therefore, to be eligible for award, offerors are required to demonstrate their capability to access, receive, store, and safeguard the critical technology and/or data required to execute the program.  The IAC is a material replacement for the current M270A1 crew cab. The anticipated IAC effort consists of three phases: An EMD phase, a Production and Deployment phase, and an Operations and Support phase. The development phase is anticipated to be 36 months in duration.<br>The Government expects to award one or more cost type contracts for development of an armored cab that meets the requirements as set forth in the Government's Statement of Work (SOW) and Performance Specification. <br> <br>Subsequent to completion of the development phase of this effort, which includes a quantity of seven (7) M270A1 IACs prototypes with delivery completion in FY15, the current schedule reflects the procurement of 225 M270A1 IACs.  A new firm fixed price (FFP) production contract is anticipated to be awarded in  FY15.  <br>Full and open competition is the desired method of contracting for this effort.   This competitive acquisition will utilize best value techniques to select a contractor to develop the IAC. <br> <br>A Request For Proposal (RFP) is planned to be released on or about 22 November 2011 with expected contract award to be made during 4rd Quarter FY 2012.  The Offeror(s) selected for award will be determined through a formal source selection process.  The contract will include incremental funding for the complete tasks delineated in the RFP SOW. <br> <br>The solicitation is planned to result in one or more contract awards in 4rd quarter FY 2012 for Phase I of the IAC development. If a single contract is awarded through Full and Open Competition, it would likely consist of a single 3-year annual CPIF contract (FY12-FY15) at the prime contract level.  If multiple contract awards are made, the contracting strategy calls for a negotiated procurement, with Full and Open Competition, for the selection of an IAC development source using a down-select method.  The source selection will be conducted in two steps.  The first step is award one or more Phase I - IAC Critical Design efforts with follow-on Phase II options.  The second step in the source selection consists of an evaluation of Phase I - IAC Critical Design efforts and updated proposals to execute follow on options post Critical Design Review (CDR) to a single offeror that presents the best value to the Government to obtain an award/exercise a Phase II - IAC Engineering and Manufacturing Development option to be exercised.<br><br>The proposal is to include costs/prices for:<br><br>Development Price (Phase I) - This part of the price/cost volume addresses the Offeror's estimate for his predicted costs for development tasks of Phase I (Contract Award through Critical Design Review (CDR)).  This price shall reflect the effort directly associated with the Government development schedule and shall include efforts deemed necessary in support of the Development program, including but not limited to: design reviews, hardware design refinement, hardware qualification, analysis updates, performance specification development, and hardware fabrication.<br><br>Prototype Manufacturing and Integration Price (Phase II) - This part of the price/cost volume addresses the Offeror's price for manufacturing seven (7) prototype IACs (including the cab and retrofit kit components) and integration of six (6) of those cabs onto Government provided M270A1 vehicles.<br><br>DT&E Price (Phase II) - This part of the price/cost volume addresses the Offeror's price for conducting testing and supporting Government-led DT&E testing.<br>Production and Operations and Support (O&S) Price - This part of the price/cost volume addresses the Offeror's estimated price for production and operations and support costs of the IAC.<br><br>The request for this RFP W31P4Q-11-R-0043 shall be addressed in writing, electronically to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Deborah Goodson, e-mail:  Ms. Deborah Goodson, e-mail:  Deborah.goodson@us.army.mil AND Ms. Alma Cuffy, e-mail:  alma.cuffy@us.army.mil.  <br>

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND. The Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP) is part of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in the Department of State. The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, executes and monitors programs to address the full range of criminal justice issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. INL has been engaged in an effort with the Government of Afghanistan to build the capacity of the Afghan Criminal Justice System to properly and securely detain arrested persons awaiting trial and sentencing as well as those who have been properly sanctioned by a court in a manner consistent with the commonly accepted human rights principles.</p>
<p>B. PURPOSE. The Regional Corrections Advisor (to include the Representative to the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force - 435 (CJIATF-435)) reports to the INL/Kabul Director through the INL/Kabul Administration of Justice Team Lead, serving as the corrections systems development expert on a full range of prison/corrections issues in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Regional Corrections Advisor would provide technical corrections expertise in a wide variety of settings, including internal U.S. embassy and multi-national meetings, to assist the Government of Afghanistan in reaching its stated Goals and Objectives in reforming the corrections/prisons system in Afghanistan. The Regional Corrections Advisor would offer assistance in a variety of areas, to include technical assistance, contingency planning and development, training and equipment needs. S/he would also serve as a resource to the INL/Kabul Director, the INL/Kabul Administration of Justice Team Lead, and the Afghan Director General for Prisons (Central Prisons Directorate) on corrections issues bringing together expertise from the United States, as well as other countries having innovative corrections projects and programs that could be considered by the Government of Afghanistan.</p>
<p><br />I. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>&bull; Serves as one of INL's corrections experts in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; Develops and coordinates corrections programs for Afghanistan in concert with other USG, international and Afghan law enforcement and criminal justice programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Serves as an advisory resource for INL/Kabul, INL/AP, CJIATF-435, and Afghan corrections officials on specific aspects of planning and implementation of ongoing corrections assistance programs in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; Oversees and coordinates Afghanistan corrections program activities with the end goal of supporting the Afghan Government in developing a safe, secure, and humane corrections system.</p>
<p>&bull; Provides policy analysis and program guidance to INL/Kabul, INL/AP, and Afghan officials on all aspects of corrections matters, addressing any of a number of issues related to corrections system reforms to include human rights issues related to prisoner incarceration; prisoner classification; strategic planning; prisoner programs; budgeting; development of correctional capacities and institutions; refurbishment and/or construction of correctional facilities; and training plans.</p>
<p>&bull; Organizes and participates in meetings, seminars, and exercises to develop plans/programs for implementation of corrections assistance in Afghanistan and improve overall capacities to effectively modernize existing institutions.</p>
<p>&bull; Attends domestic and international conferences on Government of Afghanistan corrections reforms.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepares background materials and reports used by the INL/Kabul leadership in preparing reports, speeches, briefings, and testimony to articulate INL engagement on corrections reform aspects in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; Participates in outreach activities with domestic and international law enforcement communities to increase awareness of INL programs and policies and solicit greater cooperation and participation.</p>
<p>&bull; Other duties as requested and assigned by the INL/Kabul Director and Administration of Justice Team Lead.</p>
<p>&bull; Communicates regularly with the INL/AP Corrections Team Lead.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development, and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex range of corrections areas, interpreting data that is often vague, unsubstantiated, or contradicts existing knowledge in preparing options and/or recommendations. Incumbent must develop an analysis that provides new perspectives for the understanding and resolution of complex legal, political, economic, social, geographic, or military issues as they relate to Afghanistan and the surrounding region. The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance that influences the decisions and actions of senior policy officials and the need to quickly, accurately, and decisively determine the relevance and significance of information to the policy interests of the Department. It is further complicated by the need to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent the Bureau's official assessment of complex issues, and keep the policy making and foreign affairs communities constantly apprised of new issues and developments with respect to corrections issues. Other complicating factors include the incumbent's responsibility for ascertaining the need for initiating and conducting in-depth studies on topics of critical importance to the policy formulation process, and for representing INL/Kabul on committees and working groups that address issues of vital interest to INL.</p>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>The work generally does not impose unusual physical demands when the incumbent is working at his/her office location. However, frequent travel is required to hazardous duty locations that could impose unusual and/or difficult physical demands.</p>
<p>II. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>a. U.S. citizen, eligible for a State Department Top Secret security clearance.</p>
<p>b. A total of 15 years professional work experience:<br />&#61607; At least 10 years experience in corrections operations, management, organizational development, planning, and/or training, 2 years of which must have been at the rank of assistant warden (or equivalent) or higher.<br />&#61607; At least 4 years experience in other senior management roles such as strategic planning, resource management, and budgeting. <br />c. Graduation from a certified state or federal corrections or probation officer training academy.<br />d. A bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university. Individuals without a degree but with significant corrections management experience (minimum of five years) at the warden level (or equivalent) or higher will be considered.<br />e.

Demonstrated experience which clearly illustrates the applicant's ability to manage a multi-phase, complex construction project from concept through final turnover. International experience required, experience in Afghanistan or Iraq preferred. Significant experience in correction and/or justice infrastructure projects preferred. <br />f.

POSITION ELEMENTS<br />Supervisory Controls: The Regional Corrections Advisor will report to the INL/Kabul Director in Afghanistan through the INL/Kabul Administration of Justice Team Lead, and coordinate closely with the other INL/Kabul corrections advisors as well as the Afghanistan Corrections Team Lead in INL/AP.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change the form submission deadline given in the RFI from 4 November to 11 November.

TO REGISTER FOR THIS EVENT, THE ATTACHED FILE GPO_IF_SUB_FORM.PDF MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO DANIELLE.MAESTAS@NAVY.MIL AND SAUNDRA ANDERSON@NAVY.MIL

The U.S. Navys Geothermal Program Office (GPO), as the lead office within the Department of Defense (DoD) for the exploration, development and management of geothermal energy resources on all DoD installations, has adopted an aggressive exploration philosophy aimed at identifying and assisting in the development of geothermal energy resources on military installations throughout the United States. As a step toward development of new geothermal resources, the GPO is requesting to host an Industry Forum for the purpose of eliciting information from the geothermal industry on the potential for future geothermal development on specified DoD properties; and further on the types of information that industry would require in order to make a reasoned judgment on the commercial viability of those and future unspecified properties.
 There is no specific contractual requirement related to this forum. Information acquired from contractors under the framework of the forum is for market research solely and may or may not be used in developing future contractual requirements. 

Through its exploration efforts, the GPO has acquired and analyzed a significant body of geological data on a number of potentially promising DoD properties. 

The GPO has significant expertise in the geological analysis required in the location of potential geothermal sites but requires access to industry knowledge and expertise in the transition to energy production in todays marketplace. 

For the purposes of the forum the GPO will be providing available technical geological/geothermal data for the specified properties for review by industry prior to the event.
 Industry will be invited to engage the GPO in one-on-one discussions on a broad range of topics related to the process for transition between resource exploration and assessment to development and utilization. Potential topics might range from the types of geological/geothermal data the industry would find most beneficial in assessing economic viability of a site, to the different production technologies that might be appropriate to a site, or to the types of business arrangements that might be necessary in contracting for geothermal site development.

<DESC>1.  Introduction<br>The Institute for Water Resources of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE-CEIWR) has been tasked by corps headquarters (HQUSACE) to develop a centralized computer-based system to tabulate waterborne transportation cost structures for coastal deep-draft waterway projects.  Waterborne transportation cost structures and the differentials derived from or associated with waterway project or plan alternatives serve as the primary basis for estimation of economic benefit(s) of waterway improvement and maintenance projects.  <br><br>Under the first stage development [See Exhibit I]  the emphasis of output for system development was the estimation of waterborne transportation costs for deep-draft carriers conveying foreign (i.e., imports and exports) and\or domestic trade, and serving coastal deep-draft harbors of the United States for which the Corps' Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) compiles waterway traffic data.  As this project evolves, the system will need the capability to compile and tabulate waterway operation & maintenance (O&M) data within the framework of requirements for life-cycle cost evaluation against general program management objectives of the Corps.  In addition, while the emphasis of system development will be for evaluation of O&M of deep-draft waterways, the logic and procedures for life-cycle project economic benefit and cost evaluation(s) are to be comparable with established guidance for logic, practices and procedures applied to evaluation of both ongoing O&M as well as new work for pending or newly constructed general navigation features (GNFs) and marginal or incremental improvement measures to existing waterway system projects.   <br><br>The system (known as NNOMPEAS - National Navigation Operations & management Performance Evaluation & Assessment System) will ultimately need to tabulate two general categories of costs and then have the capability to compare them as a measure for return on investment (ROI) for fiscal\budgetary evaluation of alternatives with regard to needs for ongoing O&M maintenance work and dredging.  These cost categories are:<br><br> 	Waterborne Transportation Costs (from which economic benefits are estimated)<br> 	Waterway Project Operation & Maintenance Costs (O&M) (cost for dredging and other work to     maintain some given level navigability)<br><br>Comparison of the two costs can provide for reasonable evaluation of return on investment (ROI) subject to requirements of comparability in price levels and basis of estimation relative to data compiled and applied.<br><br><br><br>2.  Background<br>This SOW is a continuation and evolution of a system developed over four years.  Exhibits I and IV present the Scopes of Work for the initial Phase 1 and 2 development of the system.  Also included as reference is the Summary Data Field Listing [Exhibit III] and the system's Programming Environment[Exhibit II].: <br><br>3.  Description of Technical Work and Requirements Under this Scope of Work or Services<br>3a.  The scope of work or services entails modification and enhancements to the version of NNOMPEAS as developed to-date with continuation or maintenance of its architecture (see Exhibit I).  Requirements under this scope of work will generally entail the following:<br> <br>a)	 Expansion of operating platform capabilities to operate NNOMPEAS in parallel systems for Oracle versions 10g and 11g.<br><br>b)	 Expansion of port coverage from the first level ("top") priority forty-three (43) deep-draft coastal ports (as defined by USACE) to the top 125 deep-draft coastal ports.<br><br>c)	 Chronological enhancement of the incorporated WCSC data set presently encompassing 2004 to 2007 for the first 43 ports to 2004 through 2010 for the specified 125 ports.<br><br>d)	Initiate development of capabilities to access data from the Corps' Resident Management System (RMS) to allow access to needed data for dredging activities to begin capabilities to perform economic evaluations of project maintenance costs.<br><br>e)	Development of user interfaces and capabilities to produce summary statistical reports and managerial-level benefit evaluations for changes in reference depth specifications maintained.<br><br>f)	Investigation and tests of feasibility for incorporating GIS capabilities for display of information related to cargo transport (i.e., mapping from origin to destination, etc.) in addition to interpreting geospatial perspective for physical location of waterway maintenance costs. <br><br>3b.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is currently migrating many of its computerized systems to more current or updated system operating environments.  IWR requires the ability for NNOMPEAS to operate with different versions of its primary software, notably Oracle database software.  NNOMPEAS was originally developed within the Oracle 11g environment for ease of use and to expedite development and testing of functions and features considered essential to the application and use of the system with special requirements such as GIS mapping applications.  The phasing of transition to updated software environments has resulted in the need to have NNOMPEAS enabled to operate in both the ORACLE 10g and 11g environments.  In addition, redundancy for capability of the system to operate on either a stand-alone platform or production network server is of critical value to USACE for rapid system restoration and avenue of alternative access in the event of primary server failure and system loss.<br><br>3c.  Also required under the scope of work or services will be the requirement to expand and update more current data from the Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) of USACE in the same format as was previously used [described in Exhibit I].  The existing NNOMPEAS system contains data for the top priority forty-three (43) domestic deep-draft coastal ports of the United States for Calendar years 2004 through 2007.  The contractor will need to further develop the system to accommodate data to include waterborne cargo statistics data for 2004 through 2010 for an expanded specification of the top 125 ports (inclusive of the initial 43 ports and as specified for USACE with data to be provided by the WCSC) for 2004 through 2010.   Data structure and fields to be incorporated shall be the same as described in Exhibit I.<br><br>3d.  To efficiently support benefit\cost evaluations of the deep-draft navigation program the NNOMPEAS system will need to access and manipulate waterway maintenance cost data.  It has been determined that the best source for compilation and consolidation of needed cost data is the Resident Management System (RMS) employed by USACE to manage dredging projects and track associated work efforts and expenditures.  Accordingly, the contractor will be required to develop a prototype NNOMPEAS module for access and transfer of needed data and information in a form preformatted for compatibility export capabilities and output reports of RMS.  This module will be developed by the contractor to allow compilation of data at the highest level (harbor or waterway system) down through the lowest level required (waterway segment) and as described and can be extracted from RMS.<br><br>3e.  In regard to application and use of NNOMPEAS for decision-making, the systems needs additional capabilities to support managerial decision-making via summarized reports for comparative statistics and alternative scenarios which address changes in assumptions concerning impacts due to changes in depth, applicable vessel operating costs (VOCs) and tonnage throughput.  Integral requirements will include the ability to store or archive scenario analysis for individual ports or groupings of ports (compatible with, and stratified according to, the existing table format for DWT or draft class, transit draft, and vessel or carrier type) for automated recall and comparison across different ports to allow regional and program-wide evaluation of the benefits of the Corps' navigation program expenditures. <br><br>3f.  Respective to development of capabilities for the NNOMPEAS system to employ applications for geographic information systems (GIS), the contractor will be required to investigate and develop a working prototype interface for loading waterway survey data descriptive of a given water system in both the vertical and horizontal planes of design and construction (i.e., length or reach and segment, breadth, and depth).  The contractor will initiate this effort with requirements for compatibility with the survey processor software HYPACK which is employed as the general standard for performance and processing of hydrographic and submerged topographic surveys.  The prototype will be developed using survey data selected from priority projects of the South Atlantic Division of USACE (Wilmington Harbor, Charleston Harbor, Savannah Harbor, Jacksonville Harbor, and Tampa Harbor).  The contractor will demonstrate capabilities for expansion of this product with respect to evaluation of all other harbors within the Corps Deep-Draft navigation program. <br><br>4.  General Statement Concerning Programming Environment (and Supporting Materials and Equipment) <br>Developmental work by the contractor will require access to detailed WCSC traffic data and information. The employed standard for waterborne commerce data compiled by the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is generally the ORACLE environment (with demonstrated expertise in Oracle 10g; Release 2 and later for Windows) and it is anticipated that this and the 11g versions of the Oracle environment will be the core system language(s) or environment around which other languages or commercial software will need to be employed via translational or interface programming.  Accordingly, for integration into the Corps Oracle environment, the work requires knowledge of the employment of all hardware, software and services in the area of Oracle database configuration and design, to both Intranet/Internet and screens for both data entry and reporting across the Corps of Engineers CEEIS backbone.  Required knowledge, skills, and abilities shall also include development and applications for: Oracle 9iAS/9iDS, Oracle 10gAS/10gDS, and Oracle 11g for Solaris and Linux; Windows 2k/XP/Vista desktop and Linux; SQL; PL-SQL, Windows 2003 server; Analytical SQL, Oracle Web tools including the Apache Listener; current versions of Oracle Developer and Designer; Oracle PL/SQL; Oracle Spatial; Oracle Map-viewer; Oracle APEX;  Oracle X10; HTML; XML; XSL; XSLT; KML; Javascript, Java; PERL, PERL DBI, MYSQL, PHP and wireless protocol access;  MS Access 2000; and primary location mapping services.  <br><br>Due to design for eventual linkage to GIS information environments proficiency in use and development of applications for Google/Earth mapping service and client will be required.  In addition, knowledge about RFID, TCP/IP, capture and transmission of NMEA data and integration with an Oracle application is required.  All triggers, interface procedures and packages developed for working with and handling data or databases within the environment as described and required by\for USACE shall be fully verified and documented.  This latter requirement may entail more or supplemental documentation than would accompany the primary documentation of contractor's core developments for the required system.  In addition to described specifications for the general programming and operating environment, ideally the contractor should have experience in the use and structure of budgetary program systems employed by the Corps, most notably DIS (Dredging Information System) and RMS (Resident Management System), in addition to the current versions of HYPACK modules for post processing, manipulation and analysis of waterway survey data.<br><br>5.  Tasks\Deliverable Items and Related Schedules<br>Work effort by the contractor will commence after assignment and completion of pre-work negotiations followed by formal issuance of the written Notice to Proceed (NTP) by the contracting officer (CO) or contracting officer's authorized representative (COR).<br><br>Deliverables as specified below are to be provided by the contractor in accordance with time allowances as summarized.  To track progress and quality the contractor will submit a written interim progress report via email or electronic means acceptable to USACE for each item (1 through 6; approximately half way through each respective calendar day timeframe) and where necessary request or comply with requests for teleconference(s) for execute problem or issue resolution (if appropriate) to fulfil contract requirements within overall specified time allowances.  The schedule of deliverables associated with the performance of the above described work will in part depend upon turnaround or response time of the government technical representative in regard to completion of review for interim reports and products monitoring via teleconferences.   For purposes of estimation regarding review of deliverables, schedules, and formulating costs of the proposal, return of written comments or requirements where appropriate (for adjustments, corrections, etc.) by the Government's technical representative shall be forwarded to the contractor within 10 to 18 calendar days as a result of review for each deliverable.  Accordingly, for estimation of costs and resource assignments to comply with this statement of work, general expectations for schedule of contract deliverables is as follows.<br><br>DELIVERABLE ITEMS	NTP + (calendar days)<br>1.   Comprehensive Demonstration of existing NNOMPEAS System Operable Under Both 10g & 11 G Environments  	30 to 35 days<br>2.  Expansion of Port coverage to the 125 ports 	60 to 70 days<br>3.

<DESC>This notice is for Informational Purposes Only: This is not a solicitation for proposals.<br /><br />The purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate in two (2) states the implementation of a comprehensive program to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).This program shall involve adaptation and application of the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) to VAP prevention, including selection and use of an intervention bundle to prevent VAP based on the most current evidence. Existing guidelines for preventing healthcare-acquired pneumonia, including the 2003 Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) Guideline for Preventing Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia, shall serve as a starting point for developing a bundle approach for VAP prevention. Each healthcare facility participating in the program will use a CDC-approved definition for VAP. The overall purpose of this project is to accelerate the adoption of care bundles to reduce VAP and to assess the impact of the defined strategies or comprehensive program on VAP rates using a regional or statewide approach.<br /><br /><br />Identification of the exception to fair opportunity:<br /><br />This order must be issued on a sole-source basis because only one awardee is capable of providing services required at the level of quality required because the services ordered are unique and highly specialized. <br /><br />The primary reason for using a sole source for this Action Task Order Contract is the unique capabilities of the contractor. The purpose of this project is to develop and implement&nbsp;a comprehensive program to prevent VAP, including application of the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) to VAP prevention. This project is designed to expand upon the highly successful Keystone Project in the state of Michigan to eliminate Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) in Central Line Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI) and Ventilator- Associated-Phenomena (VAP).The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), is unique among the ACTION II partners, in two primary ways: JHU developed and lead the Keystone Project under a grant funded by AHRQ and has successfully implemented the CUSP for VAP in Michigan. JHU is currently working on two separate projects to implement the CUSP protocol in other states nationwide. Consequently, JHU already has established working relationships with all states. No other ACTION II contractor the experience in reducing VAP efforts on a statewide basis. JHU also has an established and existing relationship and the capacity to build a statewide collaborative lead by state hospital associations. There is considerable Departmental and Congressional interest in this area, and a demand that state hospital association's work with other state partners to reduce these infections immediately. Because of JHU's unique capabilities and structure, it is the only ACTION II contractor that can address VAP in a timely manner and sustain the effort after the initial funding period. The work to establish a statewide collaborative is well underway; it is logical and practical to have JHU work in the area of VAP. JHU is the only ACTION II contractor capable of carrying out the project.
