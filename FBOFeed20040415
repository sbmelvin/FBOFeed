<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a RITEC SNAP computer controlled, advanced pulser/receiver air-coupled ultrasonic inspection system and components.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from RITEC, Inc of Warwick, RI. Applications using air-coupled transducers have more stringent instrumentation requirements than standard applications using immersion or contact transducers.  Most often, the received signals using air coupled transducers are 1/100 the size of signals from contact transducers.  This decreased signal size requires a lower noise receiver for most useful detection.  Typical receiving systems require an external preamplifier with 40-60 dB of gain followed by a receiver with approximately 20-100 dB of gain.  With a broadband receiver, it is easy for the signal to get lost in the amplifier noise, especially when the receiver has a wide bandwidth of 20 MHz.  With the superheterodyne receiver in the SNAP system, it is possible to reduce the bandwidth from 20 MHz, (or 40 or 80 MHz) to 50 kHz in some applications leading to an improvement in the signal to noise ratio of at least 20.  Use of the gated integrators will lead to a further improvement of 10 in the signal to noise.  Averaging of the gated integrators can lead to further improvements in the order of 5.  The SNAP system is unique in the marketplace with such a pulsed superheterodyne receiver system.    Such a low noise, superheterodyne receiver system has been recommended by some of the major air-coupled transducer manufacturers, including Microacoustics, whose transducers will be used for the project.  In addition, it is important to drive the air-coupled transducers with as clean a sinusoidal signal as possible.	The transmitter (pulser) on the SNAP system has been designed for applications utilizing nonlinear acoustics, where it is important to detect harmonics generated in the sample, not in the transmitter electronics.	The SNAP system gated amplifiers can produce high power tonebursts with output powers up to 5 kW, voltages up to 1440V peak to peak with lower harmonic distortion. The SNAP system is also unique that it has two independently controlled transmitter channels, two gated amplifiers and phase control so that the outputs of each of the gated amplifiers may be phased in time and frequency.  A third feature of the SNAP system, which is unique in the marketplace, is a third synthesizer, which allows the receiver to be tuned in frequency over a wide bandwith.  This permits the user to examine the fundamental frequency, any harmonic frequencies or the generation of sum or difference frequencies which can be generated in damaged or fatigued samples. The RITEC SNAP system features describe above are necessary for the complete air-coupled ultrasonic evaluation of Spray On Foam Insulation(SOFI)on the Space Shuttle External Tank.  The sole source athority for this acquisition is FAR 13.106(b)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified points of contact(see below) not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 26, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. To ensure a prompt response, interested offerors submitting inquiries or capabilities/qualifications shall send an e-mail to BOTH the Primary AND Secondary points of contacts identified in this notice. Please identify the Reference number in your correspondence. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration conducted a NADIN MSN market survey initiated by announcement 2990 on 3/11/03.  This market survey asked for alternatives to replace the existing NADIN message switching equipment, known as ‚ÄúNADIN I‚Äù, ‚ÄúNADIN IA‚Äù, or the ‚ÄúMessage Switching Network‚Äù (MSN).  Alternatives explored included: (1)	Sustainment defined as the FAA (AOS-550) technical effort rewriting the existing MSN software into a higher-level computer language running with a COTS operating system on a new COTS hardware platform. (2)	Procurement of a new NADIN message switch,  (3)	Acquiring the message switching functions from a service provider. With little schedule risk and implementation possible in 2005, sustainment will be the NADIN MSN short-term (for the next five years) solution.  However, sustainment is not the planned NADIN MSN long-term (five to ten year) solution.  The intention is to initiate the three to five year acquisition management process for NADIN MSN.  Due to the current reorganization within the FAA, it has not been determined what FAA organization will be responsible for the NADIN MSN effort.  If there are questions concerning this announcement, contact Dixie Harper at (202) 493-5940.

<DESC>The 21st Century Marine Corps will employ increasing amounts of electronic equipment to accomplish its mission, dramatically increasing the capability of the war fighter.  However, this equipment also requires increasing amounts of quality, field deployable electric power.  The systems to generate this power must be capable of rapid deployment in a wide variety of climates, terrains, altitudes, corrosive environments and temperatures.  Also, they must be rugged, transportable, maintainable, reliable, and efficient.

Currently, ground forces often tow trailer-mounted generator sets behind High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) and the new Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) to fill the requirements for electric power in the field.  However, the need to tow a large generator trailer limits the HMMWV/MTVR payload capability and can restrict mobility in extreme terrains.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt, on behalf of Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI), intends to issue a solicitation to acquire services to develop and administer culturally appropriate financial education workshops, for a base year and two one-year option periods. The objective of this contract will be to build the capacity of Native American CDFIs to serve their communities through the provision of financial education.  Because the long-term success of Native American CDFIs is, to a certain extent, dependent upon the level of effective demand within the communities they serve, the objective of this contract also includes enhancing the ability of Native communities to access credit, capital, and affordable financial services through increased financial management skills. The North American Classification code for this solicitation is 611430 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6.0 million.  
Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. If the Internet option is not available to you, you may receive a hard copy of the solicitation and any amendments (via U.S. Mail) by faxing your request to (304) 480-7203 or e-mailing your request to Gina.Hanna@bpd.treas.gov.

<DESC>Pursuant to Section 301(a) of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2004 (PL 108-137), and the Federal Register announcement of January 27, 2004, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking a contractor to manage and operate the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), in Berkeley, Alameda County, California. LBNL is a multi-program DOE national research laboratory located on a 200 acre site owned by the University of California (UofC). The site is leased by DOE from the UofC under a set of leases. LBNL conducts key elements of DOE's missions in science, energy, and the environment. In support of these missions, LBNL: (i) performs leading multidisciplinary research in the physical sciences, computing sciences, energy sciences, biosciences, and general sciences in a manner that ensures employee and public safety, and protection of the environment; (ii) develops and operates unique national experimental facilities that are available to qualified investigators; (iii) educates and trains future generations of scientists and engineers to promote national science and education goals; and (iv) transfers knowledge and technological innovations and fosters productive relationships between LBNL research programs, universities, and industry to promote national economic competitiveness. Anticipated funding for FY 2004 for LBNL, from all sources, is approximately $489,000,000. Current Laboratory programs are in Basic Energy Sciences, Advanced Scientific Computing Research, Nuclear Physics, High-Energy Physics, Biological and Environmental Research, Fusion Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewal Energy, Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Fossil Energy, Environmental Management, Policy, Planning and Analysis, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development, and University and Science Education Programs and associated Engineering. LBNL is a leading national science and technology research center which operates the following national user facilities: Advanced Light Source, Biomedical Isotope Facility, National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, and the National Center for Electron Microscopy. A national nanoscience research center, the Molecular Foundry, is currently under construction at LBNL. Additionally, LBNL performs other non-DOE federal government, and other sponsored research that supports the Laboratory's missions (notably those of the National Institutes of Health, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Defense, state government and industry). DOE anticipates that award of a new performance-based management and operating contract will be made in the last quarter of calendar year 2004 and is expected to include a 60 to 90 day transition period. All responsible parties are encouraged to consider submitting proposals in response to the solicitation. Interested parties are requested to submit an Expression of Interest directly to Tonja Stokes, Source Evaluation Board Executive Secretary, RFP Number DE-RP02-04CH11231, at e-mail address tonja.stokes@ch.doe.gov.

Future information about this solicitation will be posted on DOE's Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at URL http://e-center.doe.gov and/or FedBizOpps at URL http://fedbizopps.gov. A draft Request for Proposals (RFP), for comment, is expected to be issued in May 2004. The draft RFP will be open for questions and/or comments for approximately 30 days. An Information Conference is also expected to be held in the Berkeley, California area approximately two weeks after issuance of the draft RFP, the date and information for which will be posted at a later date. After issuance of the final RFP, expected in late June, a pre-proposal conference and a site tour will also be provided, the exact specifics for which will also be announced closer to final RFP issuance.

The purpose of this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is to shortlist individual U.S. companies, joint venture organizations or consortium of design firms and contractors (including their Jordanian subcontractors and sub-consultants).  Proposing teams or organizations may qualify based on their eligibility, availability of required resources, financial capacity, technical and operation and maintenance experience with projects of similar scope and magnitude, under a Design/Build/Operate (D/B/O) procurement process.  The qualifications of Jordanian sub-consultants who may be included in the makeup of the tendering team shall be no less than Class ì1Bî water and wastewater consultants as classified by the Ministry of Public Works and Housing.  Further, the qualifications of the Jordanian construction subcontractors shall include being listed as Class ì1î for water and wastewater work or wastewater treatment plant work or Class ì1î for electrical/mechanical work as classified by the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. The Project scope includes:  design of a new 6,550 cubic meter (1.3 MGD) average annual daily flow, wastewater treatment plant, construction, start-up and commissioning of the new plant, and the Effluent Reuse System, training involving operations and maintenance training of the Employerís personnel and operation and maintenance for a one-year period following the Employerís taking-over of the facilities. Emphasis is on low technology processes for this plant.  The Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) plans to tender the work using two steps.  The first step, or Phase 1 in the procurement process, consists of this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 consists of a Request for Proposals (RFP) that will be issued to the pre-qualified Tenderers selected by the Phase 1 process. The Project will be located near Mafraq, Jordan, about 60 Km northeast of the capital city of Amman.  The new wastewater plant and reuse system will be located at the site adjacent to the existing Mafraq WWTP that will be decommissioned after commissioning of the new plant. The successful Tenderer will enter into a direct contract with WAJ and will be the entity contractually responsible for Project design, construction, management, operation, training and maintenance.  Tenders from combinations of companies/firms are acceptable provided that all entities meet the eligibility criteria listed in this RFQ and providing they define their organization as stipulated in the RFQ.  Prospective Tenderers responding to this RFQ must be capable of executing the entire Project managing the scope of work through all of its execution phases.  The responses to the requirements of the RFQ will then be used to qualify prospective Tenderers who will be invited to submit Technical and Financial Proposals for the Project. The anticipated contract value ranges from US $5 million to US $12 million.  The Project is partially funded by a grant received from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and by the Government of Jordan. Potential U.S. contractors/firms interested in obtaining the pre-qualification document in CD format, at no cost, may contact Hope Morgan, Administrative Assistant, CH2M Hill, 11818 Rock Landing Drive, Suite 200, Newport News, VA 23606-4230, (Telephone: +1-757-873-1511, Ext. 11; Email:  hmorgan@CH2M.com) beginning on Tuesday, 8 July 2003 at 0900 hours, EDT.

A public opening to acknowledge receipt of submissions will be held at 1400 hours on the same date in the same venue.  Specific instructions regarding package markings will be outlined in the RFQ itself.  As well as the manner in which questions may be submitted by prospective parties.  Hardcopy submissions of the RFQ are required in order to be eligible for consideration.  Applications must also be responsive to all items in the RFQ in a complete manner.  The Contracting Agency reserves the right to disallow any application the Contracting Agency determines to be incomplete.  Please be advised that in the past some firms have experienced delays with international air courier services.  These delays are not uncommon and are normally a result of packages being held by customs.  Qualifications received after the closing date and time will not be accepted.  In the event prospective Tenderers elect to utilize the services of an independent local to deliver your qualifications, please be certain that he/she understands that the prospective Tenderers must submit their qualifications to the above no later than the time and due date mentioned above.  Issuance of the RFQ does not in any way obligate WAJ or the U.S. Government to award a contract nor does it commit the WAJ or the U.S. Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of this qualification package. The last date for obtaining the prequalification document is Thursday, 24 July 2003; close of business.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Diving Unlimited International (DUI), 1148 Delevan Dr. San Diego Ca., for the procurement of eight (8) tubesuit/drysuits.  The tubesuit/drysuit combination is designed to keep a diver warm in cold water.  The tubesuit allows hot/warm water to be pumped around the divers skin, helping maintain diver body temperature.  The drysuit provides insulation to minimize loss of body heat.  The suit manufactured by Diving Unlimited International (DUI) is the only manufacturer which allows sufficient flow (.5 gallons per minute with a 20 psi inlet pressure) to keep the diver warm during testing of a NSWC/USNA system.  Note that these suits are being used for test and evaluation of a NSWC/USNA developed diver-heating system.  While they are an integral part of the test, they are not, themselves, bein g tested.  DUI suits were used in the prior tests of the NSWC/USNA system  and  use of another tubesuit/drysuit for testing may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may invalidate/alter the test data compative analysis.   NAICS  code 339920 applies.  SBA size standard is 500 employees.  FSC is 4220.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst plans to release draft solicitation N68335-03-R-0015 on or around 3 Feb 2003 for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD)of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) .
 
The Navy defines EMALS as four major subsystems:  an energy storage subsystem, a power conditioning subsystem, a launch motor subsystem and a launch control subsystem.   Program goals include the ability to increase the launch performance envelope and reduce installed weight, volume and manning workload requirements over current steam catapults.  
  
EMALS is being conducted as a multi-phase procurement.  The program started with a Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) Phase synopsized in July 1999 (CBD Submission No. 349470). Both General Atomics of San Diego, California and Northrop Grumman of Sunnyvale, California received awards for the PDRR phase of the program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase will be awarded based on a limited competition between these two companies.

Basis of award for the EMD solicitation will be Best Value evaluation.  Award criteria for the EMD solicitation will include demonstrated completion of specified PDRR requirements with full scale, fully integrated EMALS hardware.  The Government will choose one concept resulting in a final, militarized version of the EMALS.    

The purpose of the draft solicitation is to promote early exchanges of  information about acquisition strategy and feasibility of the requirement. The formal RFP is expected to be released, under an approved J&A, during the July 2003 timeframe, and will be  synopsized prior to release.  The Government intends to issue a new, formal solicitation for the subsequent production phase  which will follow the EMD phase.  
 
The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this notice nor will the Government compensate any respondent for costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  Any comments provided may not necessarily be included in a formal solicitation.  

The draft RFP contains data subject to the Export Control Act.  This information may only be released to individuals or enterprises that have been certified by the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC).  It is requested that any interested parties submit a request for the draft RFP and a current, completed and certified DD Form 2345 with their request to NAWCAD Lakehurst Contracts Office , Attn: C. Montgomery (fax number (732) 323-7408  or  (732) 323-4069.

Questions and comments can be directed to Carol A. Montgomery @ (732) 323-2812.  Email - Carol.Montgomery@navy.mil.

<DESC>Air quality study of Scout Lake, Oregon in the Mt. Jefferson Wilderness.  The purpose of the proposed project is to fill the need for establishing a long-term monitoring site in a sensitive region of the US Forest Service.  One base year plus 4 option years will be awarded under the resultant contract.  The lake selected for monitoring is located in a Class I air quality region and is chemically highly sensitive to potential damage from atmospheric inputs.  The intent of the monitoring program is to provide a complete characterization of the lake, to monitor the chemical and biological components of the lake, and to monitor precipitation inputs.  Included will be a five-year program to complete the site characterization and begin the long-term monitoring.  The program could be structured to complete the site characterization in the first year or the costs could be distributed across a three-to-fiver year period depending on funding availability.  The proposed study site is Scout Lake located in the Mt. Jefferson Wilderness in the Oregon Cascades (Figure 1).  Scout Lake has been sampled once each in 1999, 2001, and 2002 (Eilers 2002).  The lake is extremely dilute, which makes it an ideal natural monitoring site.  We propose to monitor the lake either two or three times per year depending on availability of funds.  The site would be instrumented with a pressure transducer (Solinst) to record changes in lake stage, a barometric pressure recorder (to correct for unvented pressure), a string of thermisters (Onset Tidbits), a submerged light-intensity logger (Onset).  Two groundwater observation wells would be hand-augured adjacent to the lake and fitted with a 2-inch PVC liner and a pressure transducer to record changes in groundwater head adjacent to the lake.  A climate station (Onset weather station) would be established near the site to record air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed (gust and average), wind direction, barometric pressure, precipitation, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).  Averaging period for the climate station will be set at 15 minute intervals.  A bulk precipitation device will also be attached to the instrument mast to collect precipitation from spring to fall.  The majority of the precipitation to this site occurs during the winter.  Accumulated snowfall will be collected in late March by digging a snowpit and collecting an uncontaminated sample from the vertical wall in the pit or by coring through the snow with a polycarbonate tube.  Lake sampling will consist of collecting a vertical profile of in-situ water quality (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, depth, and ORP) with a YSI 600 XLM monitoring probe.  Water samples will be collected from the epilimnion and hypolimnion (if stratified) using a polycarbonate Van Dorn bottle or from the surface only if the lake is homothermic.  Samples will be placed in new NalgeneÆ containers, pre-soaked in lake water prior to use.  All precipitation, snow, and lake water samples will be analyzed for major ions (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, NO3, SO4, HCO3, pH) and nutrients (TKN, NO3, NH3, Si, TP, PO4) at the USDA Forest Service Range and Experiment Station (ions) in Fort Collin, CO and the USDA Forest Sciences Laboratory (nutrients) in Corvallis, OR.  Routine samples will be interspersed with DIW blanks, duplicates, and spikes to provide a quantitative assessment of the sampling and analytical uncertainty.  Samples will be placed on snow if available, but in all cases will be transported out of the wilderness on the same day of collection and shipped to the laboratory on the following day (or frozen for later analysis).  Zooplankton samples will be collected from the lake by lowering and retieving a 9m vertical tow using a 64 µ mesh net with a 20 cm opening, a reduction collar, and a modified Wisconsin bucket.  The zooplankton samples will be preserved in alcohol and shipped to ZP Taxonomic for analysis by Dr. Allan Vogel.   Phytoplankton samples will be preserved with Lugolís solution and shipped to Aquatic Analysts for analysis by Mr. James Sweet.  Benthic samples will be collected using a petite PONAR dredge, placed through a #30 mesh sieve (~580 microns) and shipped to ABR Scientific for analysis of invertebrates to the lowest practical taxonomic unit.  Benthic samples will be stratified into littoral and pelagic zones and pooled into these strata for analysis.  The lake bathymetry is needed for all calculations involving atmospheric loading, water budgets, and water quality modeling.  The lake bathymetry will be measured using a portable hydroacoustic unit linked to a Sokkia DGPS WAAS receiver.  At this site, we expect the precision to be within 1-2 meters, which will be more than adequate for the intended purpose.  The raw data will be screened for consistency and entered into Surfer software for creation of the lake representation using a kriging routine.  Accuracy of the map will be verified with cross-tracks over the same location and using manual soundings.  The map will be set into the landscape using the USGS 10m DEM for the area.  The historical conditions in the lake will be determined by collecting a sediment core and analyzing specific properties of the core.  The coring device most appropriate for sampling Scout Lake is a 5 cm piston corer equipped with polycarbonate core tubes. The core tube will be lowered into the sediments until resistance prevents further movement.  The resulting core will be inspected at the lake for possible discontinuities or other irregularities that would suggest some type of disturbance.  A satisfactory core will be sectioned on-site in 1-cm intervals.  The sediment will be stored in WhilrPacÆ bags and refrigerated until they are distributed among the various laboratories.  The sediment will be analyzed for percent water, P, N, and diatoms.  The dating of the sediment can be done using either 14C or 210Pb (or both) depending on the specific objectives.  14C has a long half-life ( 5730 yr) which makes it suitable for estimating long-term rates of sediment accumulation.  The advantage of this isotope is that it allows the user to develop accurate long-term ages and average rates of sediment accumulation.  The disadvantage of 14C is that the short-term resolution of the technique is poor, which means that any possible recent (eg. Last century) changes in SAR cannot be determined.  The half-life of 210Pb is 21 yr, which allows us to provide accurate reconstruction of the last 100 to 130 years.  The level of dating would be suitable to confirm (or refute) issues associated with recent anthropogenic disturbance of the study site.  Following dating of the core (at whatever level of specificity is chosen), the sediment will be analyzed for fossil diatoms, C, N, 15N, and P.  The analytical analyses will be conducted at the Oregon State University Soil Science Laboratory in Corvallis.  The diatom stratigraphy will be determined by Dr. Katrina Moser, University of Utah. Results from the project will be entered into an AccessÆ database for long-term storage and retrieval of the data.   This is a small business set-aside.  The solicitation and drawings will be available for downloading at this site, www.fedbizops.gov on or about May 3, 2004.     The Contracting Officer for this project is David Hallen, 503-668-1667.  The NAICS is 541620.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   	The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Cincinnati, OH, with Dr. Michael Caprio, of Mississippi State University (MSU), under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to develop an Insect Resistance Management (IRM) simulation model for use as a tool to interpret the development of pest resistance to plan-incorporated protectants (PIPs) expressed in crops.  The contractor shall also develop a robust and flexible predictive model that can simulate the impact of rare resistance  events on a spatial scale and will offer a realistic evaluation of the evolution of pest resistance towards crops expressing one or more Bt toxins.  The simulation model shall be hard-wired for pest biology, and shall have options for user-defined inputs around the properties of the PIP (dose, mode  of action), the pest management landscape (i.e., alternate practices, other PIPs etc.), the uncertainties around the genetics of the resistance (SS RS, and RR fitness, cross-resistance), and the IRM plan itself (e.g., refuge, stack, mosaic, no plan). The predictive model shall include the following  features: stochasticity, landscape spatiality,  single and multiple toxins at the same or different dose levels, significant biotic and abiotic factors affecting the evolution of resistance(such as population dynamics, pest biology, density-dependent mortality, density-independent mortality, mating  behavior, larvale and adult movement, immigration), genetics of resistance, initial resistance allele frequency, dominance, potential fitness costs, impact of cross-resistance, impact of alternate hosts, irrigation (or no irrigation), crop rotation, impact of agronomic practices, impact of  alternate control tactics used in conjunction with Bt designed to control the evolution of Bt resistance (e.g., synthetic insecticides), and impact of various resistance mitigation strategies (e.g., refuge, crop rotation) on the evolution of resistance This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA market research indicates that Dr. Michael Caprio, of Mississippi State University, is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to complete this project. As the developer of the "Popgen" simulation program, Dr. Caprio is uniquely qualified in the  application of simulation modeling to resistance management issues. Since the model for the current requirement is based on this "Popgen" simulation, Dr. Caprio is the only known contractor able to satisfy the government's requirements.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA  requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such a project. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before Friday, April 30, 2004 at 3:00 PM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase  order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under  FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541511. Parties should submit their technical documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2109, or 2.) by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing RFQ-OH-04-00086.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   NAICS Code: 541710  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Nuclear Energy Services, Nuclear Engineering Dept of NC State University BOC 7909 Raleigh, NC 27695-7909 for providing analyses by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) Gamma Spectrometry for arsenic and selenium content in toenail samples; and for arsenic and selenium content in water samples.  The precision and detection limits of the NAA measurement technique are known from the Standard Operating Procedure  (SOP) and supporting documentation provided as a deliverable from previous professional service contract with this contractor.  The contractor shall provide their current SOP at the time of award to ensure that no changes have been made to the operating procedure.  The contractor shall analyze  solid, cleaned and weighed toenail samples from the Nevada study population for arsenic and selenium content by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) Gamma Spectrometry.  The contractors shall analyze tap water samples from the Nevada study population for arsenic and selenium content by NAA.  The  contractor shall provide the results of all applicable information from the analysis of calibration standards and standard reference materials.  The contractor shall be responsible for the disposal of all materials used in the analysis work.  As part of a study comparing Neutron Activation Analysis  and Fluorescence Spectroscopy techniques, Nuclear Services has analyzed a subset of water and toenail samples collected as part of an arsenic study in Fallon - Churchill County, Nevada.  This data was used to determine the best method for the analysis of total arsenic content in the toenails of  this chronically exposed population.  Due to the limited amount of toenail sample provided, it is not possible to re-analyze the samples used in the comparison study.  It is critical that the entire set of samples be analyzed by the same laboratory to be able to compare data for all samples within  the study.  The EPA believes that Neuroscience Associates is the only source capable of providing the required services based on continuation of  analysis data consistent with data from previous studies in order to maintain the integrity of the research. The circumstance permitting soliciting from  a "single source" is FAR 13.106-1(b) .  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting  a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Ardra Morgan-Kelly (MC-E105-02),  RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>C.1.	TITLE

	Stable Isotopes Ratio Analysis of Marijuana Signature Program.

C.2.	PURPOSE

	The goal of this research effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the stable isotopes within marijuana to develop a ìnatural signatureî program providing region-of-origin information of this illicit drug that will be of use in federal and state efforts to identify where seized marijuana has originated from.  Given successes with isotope analyses of other drugs, it should be possible to develop an isotopic signature program to identify the geographic region-of-origin of marijuana obtained from domestic and foreign drug seizures.   Ultimately, the goal of this proposed research and database program is to develop routine monitoring tools to complement or replace current technologies for sourcing and geo-locating the region-of-origin of marijuana.  The proposed effort would be based on scientific information and chemical signals that are incorporated into marijuana naturally during growth of these plants.

C.3.	BACKGROUND

	The Need for a Marijuana Signature Program 

	Marijuana is the most widely available illicit drug in the United States today.  Yet an understanding of the quantities of marijuana produced in different regions (foreign or domestic) is limited and unconstrained.  Based on current information, models and analytical approaches, it is not possible to clearly constrain estimates of the amounts of marijuana produced each year.  Marijuana availability estimates are based on both seizure and eradication data and involve a number of untested assumptions.  While it is very clear that marijuana seizures at U.S. borders have increased from 229 metric tons in 1994 to 1,058 metric tons in 2001, a nearly 5-fold increase, it is not so clear as to whether the increased seizure numbers reflect increased efficiency in seizing samples at our borders, increased foreign production of the drug, or some combination of these two factors.  Is the increased foreign marijuana filling a gap, replacing domestically-seized marijuana?  That answer is unknown at the moment.

	Decision makers need quantitative information based on scientific information in order to better understand how marijuana is being produced (indoors, outdoors, hydroponics) and where marijuana is being produced (foreign versus domestic, which countries, which parts of the U.S.).  Stable isotope analyses of marijuana could form a foundation for a marijuana signature program.

	Stable Isotopes as Natural Taggants

	Stable isotopes are non-radioactive forms of the same chemical element with the same chemical properties but different weights  While the basic application of stable isotopes at natural abundance levels is a fundamental and common approach in biological/ecological and geochemical sciences, it is not as well established for forensics   Analyses of the small differences in isotopic composition can tell much about plant materials, recording valuable information about climate, precipitation, soils and water that together describe geographic areas.  Stable isotope composition provides a naturally occurring taggant - the label is permanent as long as the basic molecules in a material remain in their original state.
C.4.	STATEMENT OF WORK OBJECTIVES/TASKS

	1.0	Technical Requirements and Tasks to Produce a Marijuana Signature Program

	The success of this research project will hinge on several factors, the most important of which is a strong requirement for the sponsor or associated federal/state agencies to provide marijuana samples from specific growth regions or specific growth conditions (e.g., indoors versus outdoors, different geographic regions).  Thus, for any effective study, the sponsor and other federal and law-enforcement agencies shall provide the marijuana samples to be analyzed and comment on the priority for sample analyses.  To be successful, such a signature program would require two simultaneous efforts: a stable isotope analysis effort to determine which isotopes provide key information of use in geo-location efforts and a modeling program that relates isotope variations across geographic regions with biochemical models to predict the isotope ratio of marijuana plants.   

	1.1	Marijuana region-of-origin research to establish a signature program

		This Statement of Work (SOW) defines possible tasks to be performed by the contractor. A one year study is anticipated.  This research allows for initial analyses, refinements of the signature program effort, and repeated testing of the signature program.

		This research will analyze drug samples provided by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), US Customs, other appropriate federal and state agencies, and the sponsor.  Samples collected worldwide by the sponsor and these other federal/state entities will be used for the isotope analyses, including material obtained during law enforcement activities and samples of known origin to serve as standard controls.

		1.1.a	Stable isotope ratios of authentic marijuana samples seized from different regions, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and Jamaica

			Task 1.	Conduct stable isotope ratio analyses on marijuana from known locations as well as seizures of unknown origins as determined by the sponsor.

		1.1.b	Predictive model for the region-of-origin of marijuana

			Task 2.	Develop a mathematical model to predict the geographic origins of the marijuana, based on known physiological and environmental isotope factors.   

		1.1.c	Marijuana isotope database

			Task 3.	Develop a searchable database to be provided to the sponsor upon completion of the project.



	2.0	Status and Final Reports

		Quarterly status reports will summarize progress to date on isotopic analyses. A comprehensive report will be produced annually.  This report will detail the results of the analyses.

		The final report will be prepared for the sponsor's review at the conclusion of the final month of the performance period.  The final document will provide a comprehensive analysis of the stable isotope information, its value, and scientific validity.

<DESC>Background.   The NCI Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) sponsors two major initiatives that require cDNA sequencing support.  They are the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP) and the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).  Sequencing support requirements include 5í and 3í sequencing of cDNA clones, and sequencing of SAGE library clones.  Both sequencing requirements support downstream bioinformatics analyses to characterize gene expression and to select full ORF cDNA clones.

The NCI Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP) provides data that includes gene expression profiles of normal, precancer, and cancer cells based on EST and SAGE tags, SNP analysis of cancer-related genes, and chromosomal aberrations.  Biological resources and the sequences generated by the project are available to the scientific community and the CGAP web site (cgap.nci.nih.gov) provides access to all CGAP data and analysis tools. 

The trans-NIH Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC, mgc.nci.nih.gov) provides a comprehensive set of full-length (open reading frame, ORF) sequences and cDNA clones for expressed genes from human and mouse, and a partial set for rat. In addition, the OCG/NCI and the NHGRI are involved in the management of two other trans-NIH full-length ORF projects: Xenopus Gene Collection (XGC, xgc.nci.nih.gov) and Zebrafish Gene Collection (ZGC, zgc.nci.nih.gov).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

3.	CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS:    April 23, 2004 at 3:00 in the afternoon, Manila Time
4.	POSITION TITLE: Economic Governance Advisor
5.	MARKET VALUE: GS-15 ($86,417 - $112,346)
6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: o/a July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2006 with one year option to renew
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Manila, Philippines
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:


A.  BACKGROUND
 
USAID/Philippines' Office of Economic Development and Governance (OEDG) currently manages two complex, interrelated, and important sets of activities:  1) the set of activities leading toward attainment of USAID's Special Objective No. 2 (SO2)- "A More Favorable Investment Climate" throughout the country; and 2) the set of activities leading toward attainment of USAID's Special Objective No. 3 (SpO3)- "Prospects for Peace in Mindanao Strengthened." 
 
Strategic Objective 2  (SO2) targets two main areas: a) strengthening institutions important to the government's efforts to make corruption a high risk, low reward activity; and b) removing barriers to the development of competitive markets.  USAID focuses SO2 assistance in those sectors where corruption can be especially damaging, e.g., tax and customs administration, government procurement, and administration of justice.  USAID also supports the implementation of the Government of the Philippinesí (GOP) pro-competition policy in areas like aviation, inter-island shipping, and information and communications technology.
 
SO2 activities in the future will continue current foci, but may be expanded into additional, but as yet unidentified, areas.  Identification of these additional areas of focus will depend, in part, on which candidate is elected to the Presidency of the Philippines in May 2004 as well as feedback on the Missionís new strategy which will be submitted for approval in 2004.  
 
SpO3 concentrates on the armed conflict that has been going on between the GOP and Muslim separatist groups in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago for decades.  The basic strategy calls for interventions that address both peace and development, as it is clear that, over the long run, a stable peace is not possible without an expansion of economic opportunities for the people in Muslim Mindanao, and also that sustained and substantial economic growth is not possible without peace.  Current activities include: a program aimed at facilitating integration into the economy of former combatants; significant expansion of infrastructure in the conflict affected areas; expansion of availability of microfinance throughout Mindanao, with special emphasis on the conflict affected areas; an expansion of production and marketing of high value crops throughout the area; etc.  
 
USAID is currently developing a modified "conflict amelioration" strategy that will continue to address the problems underlying the conflict in Muslim Mindanao, but which will also permit the Mission to address some serious conflicts that are occurring outside of Muslim Mindanao, such as a lingering communist insurgency.  The precise identification of the specific set of interventions that may be included in this broader conflict strategy are still being defined, but it is anticipated that the interventions would include some aimed at expanding "livelihood" opportunities (i.e., a means of making a reasonable living) for people in the affected areas; agricultural development activities, local government capability development, and support for civil society.   
 
B.         STATEMENT OF WORK:

The Economic Governance Advisor will be responsible for:  1) devising appropriate strategies and plans for conflict management outside of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); 2) working with the missionís governance officer in leading the design and implementation of cost-effective programs that produce meaningful results in strengthening governance; 3) facilitating the proper coordination and integration of these activities within the Missionís portfolio; 4) ensuring that all activities are coordinated with, complementary to, and supportive of similar assistance activities of other USAID and U.S. government agencies; 5) ensuring that the design and implementation of activities are fully coordinated with international organizations and bilateral donors active in this area; and 6) providing policy advice and analyses to senior Mission management on topics related to conflict management and governance.

The Economic Governance Advisor will provide leadership as a member of both the economic governance and conflict SO teams.  The Advisor will be supervised by the Chief of the Office of Economic Development and Governance (OEDG), USAID/Philippines.

Requests for this publication can also be made by mail to: Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, AIR 4.4T, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, 22195 Elmer Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534.  This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2). 

 This announcement will be open for one year after it appears in the Fed Biz Opís and Commerce Business Daily. Initial Proposals and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. Initial proposals (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by a panel of government experts using the following criteria: (1) understanding the problem, including the ability to plan and implement the program and formulate pertinent objectives; (2) soundness of technical approach, including ability to integrate the proposed technology, adequacy of analysis and degree of technology advancement; (3) allocation of resources, experience and management, including facilities, personnel and (4) past performance in similar efforts, specific areas to be evaluated are quality of product or services, timeliness of performance, and cost control; and (5) the proposed cost and cost realism.  No further criteria will be used in the evaluation.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds.  Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated.   Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Since many aspects of the IHPTET/VAATE initiative are classified, the offerors and their personnel may need to possess security clearances up to and including the secret level for contracts associated with IHPTET/VAATE, contemplated under this announcement.  Specific reporting (DD1423) requirements shall be specified within each contract award.   At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report.  Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals (IPs) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate.  BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - IPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM.  Cost estimates in IPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged.  Offerors of those IPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal.  An invitation does not assure an offeror of a subsequent contract award.  One original and three copies of each IP, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted.  IPs and Proposals shall be submitted to the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, AIR 4.4T, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, 22195 Elmer Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534.  There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other Solicitation issued with regards to this requirement.  The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part of, or none of the responses received and intends to incrementally fund any resultant contract(s), depending on available funding. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this BAA. Responses should be forwarded at no cost to the Government.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Educational institutions, Small Business concerns, Small Dis-Advantaged Business concerns, Women Owned Small Business Concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions are especially encouraged to submit proposals for consideration under this BAA.  Note:  Only the Contracting Officer is authorized to award government contracts.

AMENDMENT 1:

This Sources Sought is being modified to answer questions raised by industry comments.  The questions and appropriate answers are as follows:

1.	Question-Is the purchase considered an ìoutright purchaseî or ìoutright exchange?î  Does the customer intend to purchase the whole engine assembly without an exchange core unit? 

Answer-The core will be an outright purchase. The Government will not provide a "turn in" engine, or "core". The Government will provide the Gearbox and QEC belly pan as specified by part number in the SOW. The option for the contractor to provide the Gearbox and QEC belly pan will also be considered as indicated in last sentence of second paragraph in "5.0 TRAVEL AND GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENTî.


2.	Question-It is stated the engine shall comply with the necessary Technical Directives and CEBs as indicated on ì4.0 TASKSî and that GFE shall be provided to the vendor for testing; if the repair station is outside the USA, does the client ship it to the vendor? Or, are these shipping costs inclusive in the proposal?

Answer- The Government will not prohibit this effort from being performed overseas, but the Government will only ship the GFE within the continental United States.  If a contractor wishes to perform this effort overseas, the Government will pay to have the GFE shipped to the closest point of debarkation in the continental United States, and the contractor will be responsible for costs of shipping the GFE overseas.  
 
3.	Question-Does the Government require pricing on the; 

a) modified engine unit; 

b) inspection, repair, overhaul and installation of the GFEs as necessary plus the related costs of wiring, accessories, components and devices; 

c) test cell labor and operation and;

d) packaging/delivery of the assembled/completed unit to Patuxent River, MD?

Answer-Yes, the Government requires that the cost proposal fully detail the costs of each aspect of this effort.  As specified in the SOW, The Government will provide for shipping of the assembled, tested, packaged and preserved engine within the QECK, from a point within the continental United States to Patuxent River NAS.

<DESC>NAVAIR Lakehurst plans to issue Request for Proposal N68335-03-R-0015 on or about 3 July 2003.  This formal solicitation is the follow-up to draft solicitation N68335-03-R-0015, synopsized on 16 Dec 2002, (Submission Number 1/63022) and released on  21 March 2003 for the Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD)  Phase of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS).  

EMALS will be the catapult system for the CVN aircraft carrier class.  The Navy defines EMALS as four major subsystems:  1)  Energy Storage, 2) Power Conditioning,  3) Launch Motor and 4) Launch Control. The program goal for the SDD phase is to deliver a fully tested shipboard representative catapult for development test and evaluation and fleet operational assessment.  Installation will be at the Lakehurst, NJ facility.   

This procurement is considered a multi-phase acquisition. The first phase of this program was the Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) Phase synopsized in July 1999 (Submission No. 349470), and awarded to both General Atomics of San Diego, California and Northrop Grumman of Sunnyvale, California in December of 1999. 

This  requirement is for the next phase of the procurement.  Competition for the SDD phase will build on results from the PDRR phase, and the award criteria for the SDD phase will include successful completion of various PDRR requirements.  Accordingly, NAVAIR anticipates that only the PDRR contractors will be capable of successfully competing for this phase, under an approved Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition. A down selection between General Atomics and Northrop Grumman  will determine the SDD phase awardee.

Any other responsible source may also submit a proposal for the SDD phase, however, to be considered for SDD award, offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the awardees under the PDRR phase.  Such demonstration includes the following PDRR phase deliverables: 1) Full Scale, Reduced Length, Fully Integrated EMALS Prototype hardware and software and its associated Detailed Design Package, 2) a Test and Evaluation Report detailing performed tests and test results that indicate the ability to meet the requirements of the EMALS Operational Capabilities Document, 3) an EMALS Specification and  4) a Conceptual Shipboard EMALS Design Package.  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.   

Proposals in response to the solicitation will be due 60 days thereafter.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR website at WWW. NAVAIR.NAVY.MIL.   A Best Value method of evaluation will be utilized to select the single awardee.  A cost plus award fee type contract is anticipated.  

The subject RFP contains data subject to Export Control regulations and this data will only be released to firms, upon written request, who are certified with the DLSC for receipt of militarily critical technical data.  See Note 8.  

Expressions of interest should be directed to Ms. Carol A. Montgomery by phone @732 323-2812, or by email @ carol.Montgomery@navy.mil

<SUBJECT>B -- Stable Isotopes Ratio Analysis of Marijuana Signature Program
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-04ZONDCP000015
<RESPDATE>043004
<CONTACT>Kevin McGowan, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-0708, Fax 301-443-3238, Email kmcgowan@psc.gov
<DESC>C.1.	TITLE

	Stable Isotopes Ratio Analysis of Marijuana Signature Program.

C.2.	PURPOSE

	The goal of this research effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the stable isotopes within marijuana to develop a ìnatural signatureî program providing region-of-origin information of this illicit drug that will be of use in federal and state efforts to identify where seized marijuana has originated from.  Given successes with isotope analyses of other drugs, it should be possible to develop an isotopic signature program to identify the geographic region-of-origin of marijuana obtained from domestic and foreign drug seizures.   Ultimately, the goal of this proposed research and database program is to develop routine monitoring tools to complement or replace current technologies for sourcing and geo-locating the region-of-origin of marijuana.  The proposed effort would be based on scientific information and chemical signals that are incorporated into marijuana naturally during growth of these plants.

C.3.	BACKGROUND

	The Need for a Marijuana Signature Program 

	Marijuana is the most widely available illicit drug in the United States today.  Yet an understanding of the quantities of marijuana produced in different regions (foreign or domestic) is limited and unconstrained.  Based on current information, models and analytical approaches, it is not possible to clearly constrain estimates of the amounts of marijuana produced each year.  Marijuana availability estimates are based on both seizure and eradication data and involve a number of untested assumptions.  While it is very clear that marijuana seizures at U.S. borders have increased from 229 metric tons in 1994 to 1,058 metric tons in 2001, a nearly 5-fold increase, it is not so clear as to whether the increased seizure numbers reflect increased efficiency in seizing samples at our borders, increased foreign production of the drug, or some combination of these two factors.  Is the increased foreign marijuana filling a gap, replacing domestically-seized marijuana?  That answer is unknown at the moment.

	Decision makers need quantitative information based on scientific information in order to better understand how marijuana is being produced (indoors, outdoors, hydroponics) and where marijuana is being produced (foreign versus domestic, which countries, which parts of the U.S.).  Stable isotope analyses of marijuana could form a foundation for a marijuana signature program.

	Stable Isotopes as Natural Taggants

	Stable isotopes are non-radioactive forms of the same chemical element with the same chemical properties but different weights  While the basic application of stable isotopes at natural abundance levels is a fundamental and common approach in biological/ecological and geochemical sciences, it is not as well established for forensics   Analyses of the small differences in isotopic composition can tell much about plant materials, recording valuable information about climate, precipitation, soils and water that together describe geographic areas.  Stable isotope composition provides a naturally occurring taggant - the label is permanent as long as the basic molecules in a material remain in their original state.
C.4.	STATEMENT OF WORK OBJECTIVES/TASKS

	1.0	Technical Requirements and Tasks to Produce a Marijuana Signature Program

	The success of this research project will hinge on several factors, the most important of which is a strong requirement for the sponsor or associated federal/state agencies to provide marijuana samples from specific growth regions or specific growth conditions (e.g., indoors versus outdoors, different geographic regions).  Thus, for any effective study, the sponsor and other federal and law-enforcement agencies shall provide the marijuana samples to be analyzed and comment on the priority for sample analyses.  To be successful, such a signature program would require two simultaneous efforts: a stable isotope analysis effort to determine which isotopes provide key information of use in geo-location efforts and a modeling program that relates isotope variations across geographic regions with biochemical models to predict the isotope ratio of marijuana plants.   

	1.1	Marijuana region-of-origin research to establish a signature program

		This Statement of Work (SOW) defines possible tasks to be performed by the contractor. A one year study is anticipated.  This research allows for initial analyses, refinements of the signature program effort, and repeated testing of the signature program.

		This research will analyze drug samples provided by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), US Customs, other appropriate federal and state agencies, and the sponsor.  Samples collected worldwide by the sponsor and these other federal/state entities will be used for the isotope analyses, including material obtained during law enforcement activities and samples of known origin to serve as standard controls.

		1.1.a	Stable isotope ratios of authentic marijuana samples seized from different regions, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and Jamaica

			Task 1.	Conduct stable isotope ratio analyses on marijuana from known locations as well as seizures of unknown origins as determined by the sponsor.

		1.1.b	Predictive model for the region-of-origin of marijuana

			Task 2.	Develop a mathematical model to predict the geographic origins of the marijuana, based on known physiological and environmental isotope factors.   

		1.1.c	Marijuana isotope database

			Task 3.	Develop a searchable database to be provided to the sponsor upon completion of the project.



	2.0	Status and Final Reports

		Quarterly status reports will summarize progress to date on isotopic analyses. A comprehensive report will be produced annually.  This report will detail the results of the analyses.

		The final report will be prepared for the sponsor's review at the conclusion of the final month of the performance period.  The final document will provide a comprehensive analysis of the stable isotope information, its value, and scientific validity.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies applicable to reduce heat stress associated with current anti-G suit and limit anti-G bladder expansion away from the pilot.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY: Current anti-G suits employ 1.7 oz polyurethane-coated nylon bladders, welded flat that inflate to round shapes. These bladders are encased in a sewn and bound 4.3oz aramid shell that is cut slightly smaller than the bladder shape to offload the bladder welds.  
The mechanism of protection is that of direct compression on the vascular tissue below the bladder as well as hoop compression around the body as the surrounding fabric casing tightens to in response to bladder inflation.
The anti-G suit is currently worn over the top of a flight coverall, dry suit, and undergarments.  In the past, the anti-G suit was worn over undergarments but underneath the dry suit and flight coverall. However, its inflation height (thus level of protection) was hampered by the size of the outer garments. Rather than increase the bulk of the outer garments to accommodate the anti-G suit, the anti-G suit was made flame resistant and moved to the outermost layer, and designed to reduce the bulk of the outer garments.  

DEFICIENCIES OF CURRENT BLADDER TECHNOLOGY:  
1) The anti-G suit bladders cover most of the surface area below the waist with impermeable bladders, which also increase thermal load.
2) The anti-G suit bladders are made of flammable, meltable materials, and must be encased within a flame resistant shell.
3) The ìfootballî shape of anti-G suit bladders seem to apply inefficient point compression to tissue, and thus requires large inflated diameters to effect venous return.
4) The anti-G suit weighs up to 6 lbs, and impacts the overall aircrew physical workload.
5) The polyurethane coated nylon fabric is sticky on its coated face, and requires a spacer fabric to prevent kinking.
6) In the current anti-G suit design, if the bladder is damaged the entire suit must be disposed of because access to the bladders is very difficult and attempts to repair the bladder may result in additional damage.
7) The skill level to repair anti-G suits is high ñ inexperienced sewing machine operators can inadvertently ìrun overî the bladder, and ruin the asset. Thus no bladder repairs are allowed.
8) The bladder design requires die cutting and die-welding which have expensive initial set-up tooling costs.
9) The polyurethane coated nylon is relatively stiff for its weight, and restricts wearer mobility.
10) The polyurethane coated nylon is noisy when it is moved ñ a deficiency in a survival/evasion situation.
11) The compression of the coverall, dry suit, and undergarments underneath the anti-G suit restricts mobility, but also creates pressure points from folds 

The applicant must demonstrate the capability to:
1) Reduce the weight, thickness, and stiffness of bladder layer 
2) Employ a channel bladder system rather than the current football to distribute pressure more evenly around body, and to reduce the inflated profile overall
3) Incorporate traditional capstan in conjunction with bladder channels
4) Incorporate holes between bladders where possible to allow heat to escape and any external ventilation air to pass through the suit towards the skin

PROGRAM GOALS:
1) Demonstrate that new bladders can exert necessary vascular compression 
2) Demonstrate that inflated profile is reduced
3) Demonstrate that bladder inflation/deflation occurs as rapidly as current 
4) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is lighter and less bulky 
5) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is more ìbreathableî ñ allows more ventilation
6) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders provides commensurate G-protection in centrifuge
7) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders reduces skin temperature and body core temperature of wearer compared to current
Note that demonstrations in centrifuge and on human subjects will be performed by NAWCAD.  Note that demonstrations 1-3 shall include testing on human volunteers.

Interested parties will be evaluated as they are received to determine the following merit criteria; (a) technical and scientific merit; (b) offerís ability to demonstrate/execute feasibility; (c) offerís existing capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of the above that will enable the vendor to achieve the intended objective; (d) ability to demonstrate and execute cost savings alternatives.  

The government is interested in written submittals of concepts and rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates for the above. Companies responding to this request should provide detailed information on their capabilities and experience to DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, AIRCRAFT SUPPORT CONTRACTS DEPARTMENT (Air 2.5.1.3), ATTN: Jessica McGee, Code 2.5.1.3.2.7, 21983 Bundy Road Unit 7 Bldg 441, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127.

This part of the evaluations is conducted without the related price proposals.  The evaluation process will include an assessment of risk--primarily in the  areas of quality, cost, and schedule.  The price analysis is conducted in accordance w ith FAR part 15 by a separate team.   Technical factors are listed in order of decreasing importance; Factor 1 is more important than factor 2, which in turn is more important than factor 3, and so on.  Within each factor, sub-factors are of equal importance.  Award for this procurement will b e based on technical factors and price, which together constitute a best value to the Government, although not necessarily to the lowest price. To be considered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors.  Technical evaluation includes evaluation of the both the technical proposal and the subcontracting plan.  The criteria for technical evaluation factors for this effort shall include: Factor 1 - Past Relevant Experience of Offeror's Team: The Offeror as a D esign-Build Team shall demonstrate past relevant experience by providing recent and relevant Design-Build Experience and/or Design-Bid-Build Experience.  Factor 2 √¢¬Ä¬ì Proposed Engineering Systems: The Offeror shall demonstrate their understanding of the  project design requirements by submitting key features of work as part of the proposal.  These include Sustainable Project Rating Tool score sheets and descriptions, water tower design, wall sections, and exterior renderings.  Factor 3  - Past Performance  of Offeror's Team:  The Offeror as a Design-Build Team shall demonstrate at a minimum satisfactory performance and evaluation information, including timely completion of punch list and warranty work, for the projects submitted.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated by this factor (factor will be excluded).  Factor 4  - Qualifications of the Offeror's Team:  The Offeror shall ide ntify the areas and percent of construction they intend to self perform and the areas and percent of construction they intend to subcontract along with the names. Also they shall provide an organization chart and the key personnel for the Offeror's Design- Build Team.  Factor 5 √¢¬Ä¬ì Performance Schedule: The Offeror shall provide a detailed project schedule demonstrating their understanding of the project requirements and ability to complete the project in a timely manner.

<DESC>The Office of Governmentwide Policy, in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget, seeks information related to government-wide business consolidation efforts.  The objective of this initiative is to establish common solution and target architecture approaches that identify systems, best practices, migration strategies and key interfaces to develop common business process and system solutions in each of three business areas: financial management, human resources, and grants management. 

This is a Request For Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). The Lines of Business (LoB) Task Force intends to assess the capabilities and then issue an RFP at a later date. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Acquisition is currently planned to begin in FY 2005.  Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this RFI is to provide industry and government service providers with a vehicle to describe solutions and implementation approaches for achieving the goals of the three business areas (also referred to as the Line of Businesses or ìLoBî) through the development of common solutions and target architectures. This will enable the LoB agency managing partners to incorporate strategies, alternatives, and experiences, representing best practices in developing and implementing transformational common solutions and a target enterprise architecture, into business cases for these lines of business in time for the FY 2006 budget process. The ultimate goal is to develop and implement common solutions for the government that provide capabilities that achieve the LoB objectives. This requirement builds upon the existing E-Government framework and facilitates a federal enterprise-wide effort. 

The intent of the RFI response is to: 
ß	Identify solutions that address LoB vision and goals.
ß	Be structured so that its results can be used to develop the LoB common solution and target architecture.

SCOPE
The RFI is soliciting information regarding the Common Solution and Target Architecture for each of the following business areas:
ß	Financial Management (Managing Partners: Department of Energy/Department of Labor)
ß	Human Resources (Managing Partner: Office of Personnel Management) and
Grants Management  (Managing Partners: Department of Education/National Science Foundation)

<DESC>Sources Sought Judge Advocate General√¢¬Ä¬ôs Corps√¢¬Ä¬ô  Work Management System WMS Introduction The Army Judge Advocate General√¢¬Ä¬ôs Corps JAGC through its Work Management Work Group WMWG is seeking capabilities information and a capabilities demonstration (at no cost to the JAGC) on legal work/case management system WMS software to manage legal wo rkload e.g., cases, actions, matters via a web-based application that also provides limited disconnected from the Internet and synchronization on Internet reconnection. This document requests information for a JAGC enterprise wide web-based WMS, that has knowledge management/sharing capability, including software, installation, integration, training, and support. Submit written responses no later than 10 May 2004.  The JAGC CMWG will review responses received and contact submitters to arrange a capabilities demonstration.  If the JAGC determines to issue a Request for Proposals, it would anticipate contract award a nd implementation of the WMS phased rollout beginning in September 2004. Send responses to: Office of the Judge Advocate General ATTN:  DAJA-IM Room 735 Work Management Work Group 901 N. Stuart Street Arlington, VA 22203-1837 JAGC Legal Practice JAGC personnel, as part of the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs largest law firm, provide a full range of legal services e.g., client representation, oral and written opinions and advice, trial litigation to a vast range of Army clients - the war-fighter, the unit commander, the taxpayer, the military dependent, the defendant, the installation commander, the contracting officer, the claimant, the Army Staff, the EEO counselor, the retiring Senior Executive Service civilian.  Potential clients include the nearly 500,000 active duty soldiers, the equally large number of military dependents, the thousands of Army civilian employees and the hundreds of thousands more Reserve Component soldiers located around the world.  Core legal missions include fostering Army personal and organi zational discipline; advising commanders and other Army leaders; providing soldier services in claims, personal legal assistance, and military criminal defense; protecting Army interests before regulatory boards and in civil courts; and professional develo pment.   When fully deployed, there will be 5,000 √¢¬Ä¬ì 6,000 users in more than 200 legal offices in the United States and sixteen foreign countries, possibly including Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Iraq.   Appendix A describes desired work/case management system capabilities.  Appendix B lists current hardware and software details.  Currently, there are several partially deployed legacy WMSs in limited use, about 400 users.  Data migration from those legacy systems will be dealt with separately from this request.  Several case management functions are implemented with different softwa re programs.   Army legal offices and personnel operate generally independent of other legal offices, often confronting similar legal questions in thousands of actions annually.  Some regular statistical reports, e.g., monthly, annually, are aggregated through intermedia te organizations to the Headquarters, JAGC.  Where practicable, an easy knowledge management ability to share work product, e.g., legal advice, for reuse in similar situations is desired. Annually, thousands of similar cases are prepared for trial √¢¬Ä¬ì courts-martial, civil litigation, tort claims, administrative boards/procedures.  The WMS should manage/track these matters in the originating office and share their status/selected informa tion with other offices located elsewhere, including statistical information reporting. Most of the JAGC business processes are workflow with associated information.  Each case, be it civil litigation, a court-martial, a claim, a request for legal assistance, a request for legal opinion, or any other type of business process, can be seen as t he flow of a matter down a particu lar path with appropriate documents associated to it.  The WMS should allow for matter management, i.e., the creating, handling, and routing of individual case records from request through record retirement and electronic archiving, and subsequent user sea rching. Training Requirements Professional training is critical to the successful implementation and use of the eventual application.  The JAGC is committed to having all staff receive the best possible training in a reasonable time period. Please make your recommendations for JAGC tra ining √¢¬Ä¬ì pre-initial deployment and web-based end user training.  Training will be required for all users and for the JAGC√¢¬Ä¬ôs WMS administrators. The JAGC may also require annual maintenance and support on the installed WMS and proposed price should be included.  Training proposals should include train-the-trainer se ssions and web-based end user training/tutorials because many users will not be able to travel from their duty locations to attend live training. An on-line Help function is also desired. Initial training Initial WMS training should be available for all users √¢¬Ä¬ì attorneys and staff, and should include an overview of the system.  Some initial user training must be available via computer-based training for remote users. On-going and follow-up training After the initial training, the JAGC will transition into the new WMS. As the JAGC progresses with the new system, follow up training will help to increase and optimize productivity for all users. System administrator training The JAGC will require additional training for the Work/Case Management System administrators. This training should include, at a minimum, all customization capabilities, document generation and management, rules-based customization and report writing. Demonstration Developers should propose a capabilities demonstration.  Appendix C describes a suggested minimum. Prices Purchase cost estimates should include all material (e.g., user manuals), software, hardware, recommended maintenance, and recommended training as individual line items. Appendix A JAGC Work Management System Requirements Summary Introduction: No matter where we are stationed, the JAGC at all levels receives numerous taskers daily (whether in the form of an email request for legal opinion or analysis, newly filed administrative or court litigation, or a client walking in the door).  Every legal office has a system (even if it is a pencil and a logbook) to track at least some of this data, usually keeping track of the subject/name of the action, where it came from, when it came in, who worked on it, when it left, where it was sent to, and where th e office copy is filed.  This data is then used to respond to queries about matters whether in the form of periodic reports (such as a list of all open matters in a section) or in response to a question about a particular matter. The JAGC desires to standardize this process across the JAGC to enable the legal office to better, i.e., more quickly and more fully, respond to queries and to plan workload.  The system design must balance the effort expended in inputting data with the fu ture anticipated benefit.  The system can include as much detail and information as the planners deem appropriate,even to the point of eliminating the need for a paper file cabinet, and the effort the end users are willing to expend in inputting data for t he future. Technology is not an end unto itself, rather it is a tool that supports our overall mission accomplishment.  Legal information technology is an enabler to getting the job done well. Since the JAGC has multiple departments/organizations that operate generally independent of other, similar offices, our WMS should be customizable, meaning you can use the same WMS, but customize the data screens, the rules-based calendar, the document mer ge, and the reporting for each department/organization.  It would support app ropriate knowledge sharing to allow users to leverage work others have done instead of reinventing the wheel, yet also preserve sensitive/confidential information from unauthorized access. Overview: A user-friendly, web-based set of tools for JAGC legal professionals to manage cases and actions √¢¬Ä¬ì all assigned matters or work.  Beyond mere action tracking, it √¢¬Ä¬ì  (1)	automates standards related to matter management processing (i.e., intake, open, close, report), and proactively tracks completed events, as well as those about to occur based on user-defined rule-sets;  (2)	is a JAGC-wide workspace or portal to all matter-related tools (e.g., word processors, spreadsheets, email, JAGCNet (http://www.jagcnet.army.mil), and Internet-based legal research sites) for JAGC legal professionals to efficiently get the job done;  (3)	integrates system data with standard correspondence templates;  (4)	sends automated notices/responses to clients or associated professionals; (5)	provides proactive, automated, system generated responses to upcoming events or actions as required; and (6)	exchanges/shares information with other DoD/Army information systems, including use of common access/smart card.  Expected JAGC-wide WMS Benefits √¢¬Ä¬¢	Common look, touch, feel JAGC-wide √¢¬Ä¬¢	Standardized application in all JAGC SJA Offices/divisions √¢¬Ä¬¢	Reduced global/disjointed System Management tasks √¢¬Ä¬¢	Browser based √¢¬Ä¬ì Nothing to install locally (except for disconnected from the Internet operations) √¢¬Ä¬¢	Document Attachments   images too!  Searchable √¢¬Ä¬¢	Instant Global Support, updates √¢¬Ä¬¢	Uniform practice area checklists/rule-process sets System Performance:  For an Army-wide enterprise information system with users world-wide, performance will be an important characteristic of the implemented solution.  Caching and load balancing or some equivalent to help meet some of the required levels of performance. User Interface:  An intuitive, user-friendly interface that incorporates the way legal personnel work will greatly enhance end user acceptance.  Reliability, Availability, Maintainability: A solution architecture and design providing a reliable system that is highly available and maintainable in accordance with other systems of this scope and magnitude. Adaptability: The WMS must indicate not only how the current capabilities are met, but also how the system is architected or designed to allow for future growth.  The solution must adhere to open standards and implementations that allow the easy adaptation  to service oriented architectures. Collaboration: The ability to support collaborative authoring of documents.  This may include human interaction and communication using electronic methods such as sharable screens, web conferencing, and common document repositories.   Knowledge Management: Each JAGC user builds upon the work of those who preceded us.  Unfortunately, often their efforts and research are lost to the ages√¢¬Ä¬¶and we start all over again.  The WMS must have a user-definable knowledge management/sharing cap ability so policies may be established for searching/accessing existing briefbanks, precedent files, notes-for-retained-copy, or in other ways not relearning how to build the wheel. Other √Ç¬∑	Internet Web Browser Interface for remote access via Internet √Ç¬∑	Information exchange/retrieval, e.g., interfaces, with other DoD/Army applications/information systems, e.g., personnel info systems to pre-populate usual legal templates √Ç¬∑	Download info to laptop with synchronization capabilities √Ç¬∑	BlackBerry/Personal Digital Assistant synchronization capabilities √Ç¬∑	Stability of WMS company √Ç¬∑	Company installations & experience √Ç¬∑	Initial response time for questions from firm √Ç¬∑	Toll-free support √Ç¬∑	Response time  Appendix B JAGC Hardware & Software Information submitted should include recommendations for file server and desktop workstatio n minimum hardware requirements. All JAGC personnel have access to a desktop operating system, while some 500 √¢¬Ä¬ì 1,000 users operate a laptop/docking station either in the office (e.g., garrison installation) or on the road, e.g., deployed, traveling.  All offices are internally netwo rked and have Internet access.

Security considerations: All applications purchased by the Army must meet DoD and Army security requirements to include the ability to accredit the system per DoD regulations.  Listed below are some of those requirements. √Ç¬∑	Authentication - The application must be able to positively identify the user through the use of User IDs passwords and PKI enabled devices for authentication to the application. √Ç¬∑	Safeguards and Accountability - The system must provide controlled access to information so that the user has access to only the information to which the user is entitled.  Safeguards must be in place to ensure that each person having access to the ap plication may be held accountable for his or her actions.   The minimum auditing information is: (a) the identity of each user, (b) the time and date of the access, (c) user activity sufficient to ensure user actions are controlled and open to scrutiny, an d (d) activities that might modify, bypass or negate the application safeguards.  The system administrator should be able to selectively audit users by their User IDs. √Ç¬∑	Communications - Communications between the server and workstation should utilize DoD approved encryption solutions. The application will be secured using 128 bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections if the system is web based. Applications that use  web engines and databases should be able to be operated on separate servers, with the web engine on one server and the database on a separate server.  If the system uses mobile code such as ActiveX controls or JAVA, the mobile code must be signed mobile c ode.   √Ç¬∑	Code Changes - Changes to the application code due to security vulnerabilities must be able to be accomplished in a timely manner based on the severity of the vulnerability.

<SUBJECT>F--STREAMGAGING SERVICES
<DESC>The Pacific Northwest Region, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Burley, Idaho, per the authority of FAR 6.001(a) and using FAR Parts 13 procedures, intends to negotiate a non-competitive contract with the State of Idaho, Water District 1, 900 N. Skyline Dr. Suite A Idaho Falls, ID 83402-1718  for stream gauging services on the upper Snake River. The NAICS Code applicable to this requirement is 541690. The State of Idaho, Water District 1 is the only entity qualified to perform this work for the following reasons:  a) Water District 1 is the entity charged with water right accounting in the upper Snake River, substantially the same area covered by Reclamation's Minidoka and Palisades Projects.  The Water District's water right accounting requires much of the same data as operation of Reclamation's facilities.  To avoid duplication, Reclamation and the District share the cost of data collection and the District offers to provide the data at approximately one half the actual cost of its collection.  b)  The sites covered by the contract are a portion of an integrated program that includes interagency agreements within the Department of Interior.  The sites are chosen to avoid jurisdictional problems while preserving the economies of scale and limiting access to secure federal systems and facilities. Although this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, persons interested in this requirement may identify their capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  All information received by 4:00 PM MST, April 26, 2004, will be considered by the Government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination not to compete this proposed action, however, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Submit inquiries and/or proposals to Amada Renken by FAX at 208-678-4321 or by EMAIL to arenken@pn.usbr.gov.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>J--OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE INDUSTRIAL WASTE WATER TREATMENT AT ARC
<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) has a requirement to provide operation and maintenance support to the Industrial Waste Water Treatment Facility (IWTF) at ARC.  NASA/ARC intends to purchase the support from Process Scientific Inc, (PSI), 960 Saratoga Avenue, Suite 213, San Jose, CA 95129. This sole source is made under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b), for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source. Process Scientific Inc. (PSI) is the only known source that has intimate knowledge of the following criteria necessary for ensuring proper operation and maintenance of the IWTF:  1) the incoming water quality and range of variation entering the reverse osmosis (RO) system, 2) the characteristics of the RO system membranes installed, and 3) correct parameters to monitor to assure no fouling of the system.  PSI designed the RO membranes and configuration for the IWTF.  Failure to pay attention to any one of the criteria listed can result in the failure of the membranes shutting the system down and require replacement of the membranes. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Statement of Work below outlines the requirement for providing operating and maintenance of the IWTF. Background: The Industrial Waste Water Treatment Facility (IWTF) treats process water to remove heavy metals and dissolved solids before recycling the water back for reuse and discharge to the sanitary sewer.  The System consists of microfilitration and reverse osmosis (RO) processes to accomplish the treatment.	The RO system allows the water to be reused by reducing the total dissolved solids significantly. This reduces the amount of water going to the PTOW and the costs to the government by not only reducing the amount flowing to the PTOW but the higher quality of the water reduces the pretreatment chemicals that have to be added to the water for use in the boiler. The RO system requires monitoring and cleaning to maintain its effectiveness. Scope of Work: The requirement will consist of periodically reviewing and making recommendations on the operation and maintenance of the RO system in order to provide ~ 10 years of trouble free membrane life for the RO. The work will consist of onsite visits, office analysis, and both oral and written reports at the request of the government. Deliverables: Deliverables will be either or both oral and written reports on how to operate and maintain the RO system and change the system to meet future requirements. Place of Performance: Performance will include site visits and work at the contractor's place of business Period of Performance: The period of performance will be for five years. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 1:00pm (PST) on April 24, 2004, such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS)
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS)

The following information is provided for planning purposes only and is subject to change. This Request For Information (RFI)does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government is not committed or obligated to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this RFI or contractor response to this RFI.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is in the process of conducting market research and planning for the acquisition strategy for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) for the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS).  JPALS is a rapidly deployable, adverse terrain, survivable, maintainable, and interoperable Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)-based precision approach and landing system (on land and at sea) that supports the warfighter when atmospheric ceiling and visibility are limiting factors.  JPALS is a Joint Program and the Navy, Air Force and Army are participants. For the purposes of this acquisition, JPALS will be composed of three variants.  Variant one is the Land Based Fixed system, variant two is the Land Based Tactical system, and variant three is the Sea Based system.  Enabling technologies include Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) with an anti-jam capability, a Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) UHF Data Link (Sea Based only), a one way VHF broadcast (Land Based only), a to be determined Combat Operations Data Link(Land Based only) and an Inertial Navigation System (Sea Based).

A competitive, performance-based specification RFP for the JPALS SDD effort is currently planned for release in June 2005, resulting in a Best Value source selection award in November/December 2005.  

The JPALS management team solicits industry comments to the following:

1.	Primary consideration is for a Cost-Plus Incentive fee (CPIF) type contract; however, potential for use of a Fixed Priced Incentive contract has not been precluded.  Industry input is solicited regarding selection of contract type as well as for ideas to consider for an effective SDD contract incentive program, considering cost, schedule, performance and/or other factors.

2.	What tasks, technologies, or managerial aspects applicable to this acquisition would you characterize as high or medium risk areas?  What mitigation techniques would you recommend be employed to those respective risks?  What type of Contractor/Government organization structure would be effective for this sort of acquisition?

3.	Comments are solicited regarding the Industrial Base interest and projections for differential GPS and other technologies related to JPALS.  Comments are solicited regarding capability to maintain a strong, competitive supplier base, including small and small disadvantaged business participation. 

4.	It is critical to maximize commonality in areas such as hardware and software configuration, testing processes, and user interface between the JPALS variants. This commonality will enhance affordability, interoperability, maintainability, and training concepts.  The government is considering consolidating the technical requirements for all three variants into a single performance and interface standard. The potential risks for this are not fully understood and industry comment is encouraged. Industry input is encouraged on methods to implement such commonality during SDD.  Input is requested regarding contractor Design-to-cost approaches and objectives. 

5.	Open Systems Architecture (OSA) and Software Communications Architecture (SCA) are planned for the JPALS variants.  For the purposes of this RFI, acceptable descriptions of these architectures are found at the following web sites:
OSA: http://www.sei.cmu.edu/opensystems/glossary.html
SCA: http://jtrs.army.mil/sections/technicalinformation/fset_technical_sca.html

You are requested to provide any comments as to recommended approaches and feasibility of Open Systems Architecture and Software Communications Architecture approaches for integration in a variety of aircraft, surface ship platforms, and Land Based sites.	

6.	Various sparing strategies are being considered, including ìhotî spares versus on the shelf.  There may be similar electronic systems in industry that employ this approach, without reduction of high standards for system availability and dependability.  JPALS is interested in business case analyses or experience that may show the effectiveness of embedding spares versus traditional supply management.  Due to our current technology refresh plans every 3-5 years, interest in packaging complete support within the hardware system to simplify the external support system is desirable.  This facilitates potential manpower reduction opportunities.  Lastly, risk mitigation planning alternatives not addressed above for diminishing resources are encouraged.
 
7.	A JPALS Industry Day is being planned for on or about 21 July 2004 in the Lexington Park, MD area. Potential prime contractors and subcontractors are invited to attend.

<SUBJECT>R -- RFI - Automated Pay/Accounting
<DESC>Note: This is a Request for Information only.  Do not respond with quotes, proposals or offers. This RFI does not represent a commitment by the CPA to issue an RFP or RFQ.  Submissions should not be in .ZIP format.   Responses my be sent directly to the POC as listed in paragraph 7.0  

1.0	SUBJECT. Request for Information (RFI) for a Personnel Management/Pay and Accounting System for the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.  Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on May 7, 2004.  See section 7.0 for further information.


2.0	PROBLEM DESCRIPTION.  The Department of Defense (DoD), Office of Security Cooperation, is tasked to organize, train, mentor, and equip credible and capable Iraqi Security Forces in order to accelerate the transition of security from Coalition Forces to Iraqi Forces.  In order to effectively accomplish this goal, a responsive personnel management, pay and accounting system must be in place.  The current methods in place are entirely manual.  The method of payment relies upon rosters being centrally maintained along with centralized disbursement of pay across Iraq.  At the current growth rate there will be nearly 6000 being paid by mid May of 2004 and over 30,000 being paid by September 2004. This system will quickly become too labor intensive to effectively manage.

3.0	OBJECTVE. To procure an automated personnel management system that incorporates a pay and accounting system. Instructions and display characters shall be in both Arabic and English.  Initial training may need to be included with the system.  The scope of the technical solution may be from a combination of automated/manual system up to and including an integrated, Web based, commercial software package that is responsive, and cost-effective.  The Government will consider separate solutions/installation schedules.

4.0	HIGH LEVEL INFORMATION SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS


This section enumerates the high-level functionality and requirements for a Personnel Management/Pay and Accounting System.  

The high end solution will enable customers to input individual personnel data at recruit initial entry points and will allow updates via trusted clients at personnel support centers located at permanent duty stations. The Personnel Management portion of the system should be able to be implemented separately from the Pay and Accounting System but will utilize data fields common to both systems.  The Bandwidth conservative solutions are preferred over bandwidth insensitive solutions. A dial up, text only interface should be included as an option or even the solution.
The Government desires the best commercially-available system that fulfills the objectives described in this Statement of Objectives (SOO).  A turnkey solution is desired.  While negotiable, the source code shall be treated as Government-Off-The Shelf (GOTS), to include unlimited Government data rights. Expedience is a priority over technical depth.
Planned Fielding and System Characteristics.  The Government plans an initial deployment to the Ministry of Defense located in Baghdad and will grow to incorporate 10 military bases and several recruiting centers.  The system must incorporate a data base that must be able to support a work force of 300,000 personnel.  The following characteristics are desirable:
ÑX	Must be compatible with Windows OS.
ÑX	Support a broadly distributed network.
ÑX	Incorporate appropriate measures to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation. Where technical solutions allow, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication is desired.  
ÑX	Be able to support concurrent actions from multiple nodes.
ÑX	Provide a process for auditing, track authors, permissions, history and generate session logs.
ÑX	Incorporate printable reports for individual personnel.
ÑX	All user, audit and other collaboration-related files and data will be stored on Government-provided storage devices.  
ÑX	Support node additions by Government representatives without the requirement for contractor system support personnel. 
The contractor is to install and operate all associated software at the primary Personnel Support Center.  System training may be conducted on site.  Instruction and training for follow on installations at remote sites must be provided.

5.0	RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit. We would like the following sections to be covered:

Section 1 °V Software modules and implementation alternatives

Briefly describe your proposed software functionality. Include information on each module°¶s capabilities, and propose implementation alternatives.

Section 2 °V System implementation methodology

Briefly describe your implementation approach and provide examples of similar projects where your company has implemented this software including but not limited to the region of the Middle East.

Section 3 °V Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide software costs (licenses fees and structure). Provide user training costs and discuss cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations

Section 4 °V Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.

In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI. Any relevant lessons learned.  


Section 5 °V Additional Materials

Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate.

Offerors are advised that entry through any other gate could result in excessive delays or searches of vehicle contents by non-Government personnel.  Anyone delivering a proposal, including persons having authorized access to JSC, may be subjected to searches or delays when attempting to enter through a gate other than Gate 4. Gate 4 can be reached by traveling east on Bay Area Boulevard from Interstate Highway I-45.  Turn right off of Bay Area Boulevard at Space Center Boulevard and enter the Johnson Space Center at the first entrance on the right.  Gate 4 is open from 6:00 a.m. local time.  Upon entering the site, Offerors will encounter a security guard posted at Gate 4.  Offerors shall advise the guard posted at Gate 4 that they are delivering a proposal and should receive instructions to proceed to a security checkpoint (Post 12).  Since all incoming freight is screened, to avoid delays Offerors are encouraged to limit vehicle contents to the proposal being delivered. (f) Upon arriving at the security checkpoint (Post 12) each Offeror shall verify with the guard that an authorized civil service point of contact has been requested to meet the Offeror at Post 12 to take delivery of the proposal. The time when the authorized civil service point of contact has been notified by a security guard that an Offeror has arrived with a proposal will determine the official proposal submission time. Offerors are encouraged to schedule delivery at least 2 hours before the cutoff time to ensure that their proposal is properly acknowledged as on time by the authorized civil service point of contact.  The cutoff time for proposal submission is 12:00 p.m. noon, CST, local time, on the due date designated in paragraph (b) of this provision.  Upon arrival of the civil service point of contact, the packages will be screened and the authorized civil service point of contact will take delivery of the proposals at that time.

Use of cleanroom approved products is required (specifically, Dow Corning 732 sealant is an approved caulking material). 3.	The Offeror may meet with NASA personnel at JSC at any time prior to the RFO due date to verify field dimensions and review project scope.  Please visit URL   http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/scr/default.asp   for contact information to arrange for this visit.  4.	The Offeror shall provide information on no more than three contracts involving installation of cleanrooms at other Government or NASA sites, listing contract number, contract value, customer name and point of contact (including address, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail address, if available), description of the service provided and status of the contract. If the Offeror does not have Government experience, then provide non-governmental experience. Offerors will not be penalized for lack of Government contracting experience.  5.	Efforts should be made to keep offers as brief as possible, concentrating on substantive information essential for a proper evaluation. Technical information shall not exceed 3 pages. This page count does not include #1, #2, and #4 above, and #6 below. 6.	The Offerorís proposal shall briefly describe the qualifications and experience of the personnel to be assigned to the project. In addition, the Offeror shall provide documentation of training and certification to assemble/install the cleanroom described in the SOW. 7.	Facsimile or email offers are acceptable, except that #2 above, samples, must be submitted in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-1, Paragraph (g) and FAR Clause 52.212-1 ADDENDA, Paragraph (J) entitled, ìSubmission of Offers ñ Delivery Instructions.î 8.	Offeror proposal should include items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 above, including 52.212-3 Representations and Certifications ñ Commercial Items, and a signed copy of SF 1449. 52.212-2	EVALUATION ñ COMMERCIAL ITEMS  (JAN 1999) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror and whose offer (1) meets all requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW) and whose offer (2) presents the best combination of price and qualitative value to the Government.  This procurement shall be conducted utilizing Best Value Selection (BVS), which seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government. BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of Mid-Range procurements and predefines the value characteristics that will serve as the discriminators among offers.  BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value. Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose proposal has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other proposals warrants doing so.  The Statement of Work (SOW) serves as the Governmentís baseline requirements. Those offers determined to meet the baseline requirements will be judged against the value characteristics listed below which establish what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer beyond the baseline requirements. The value characteristics are performance based and permit selection of the offer, which provides better results for a reasonable increase in price. All these factors combined are approximately equal to price or cost. On those value characteristics the Offeror chooses to provide, adequate information should be submitted to permit proper evaluation. The following value characteristics are applicable to this procurement:  1.	Past experience installing cleanrooms used for curation of astromaterial samples. 2.	Past experience installing cleanrooms at other Government or NASA sites.  3.	Maximize use of the ISO Class 5 laboratory space within the existing ISO Class 7 space. 4.	Cleanroom wall grilles and FFUs designed for ease in maintenance/filter access. 5.	Warranties for HEPA fan filter units, pressure monitoring gauge, and smoke detection system. 6.	Schedule. The Government will evaluate offers in two general steps:  Step One ñ An initial evaluation will be performed to determine if all required information has been provided and the Offeror has made a reasonable attempt to present an acceptable offer. Offerors maybe contact only for clarification purposes during the initial evaluation. Offerors determined not to be acceptable shall be notified of their rejection and the reasons therefore and excluded from further consideration.  Step Two ñ All acceptable offers will be evaluated against the specifications/Statement of Work (SOW) in the model contract attached to this solicitation and the value characteristics listed above. Based on this evaluation, the Government has the option, depending on the specific circumstances of the offers received, to utilize one of the following methods: (1) make selection and award without discussions; or (2) after discussions with all finalists, afford each Offeror an opportunity to revise its offer, and then make selection.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerís specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  		     (End of Provision)  If the end product(s) offered is other than domestic end product(s) as defined in the clause entitled "Buy American Act -- Supplies," the offeror shall so state and shall list the country of origin.

<DESC>COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATIONS COSTS OF DISPLACED PERSONS SETTLEMENTS USING GRID- AND CLUSTER-BASED DESIGNS

This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  The US Agency for International Development, Bureau of Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance, Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/DCHA/OFDA) intends to award a Purchase Order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures to accomplish the assessment outlined below.  Submissions should be limited to 15 pages or less.

PURPOSE:
OFDA seeks a contractor to conduct a comparative assessment of the development and operations costs of displaced persons settlements using grid- and cluster-based designs.  The contractor will develop and submit a report on the assessment.  The duration is expected to be 11 months.  


BACKGROUND:
The international humanitarian community has relied on grid-based designs to build displaced persons settlements for decades, but research in the development community indicates that significant cost savings on the order of 30-40 percent can be achieved by adopting the cluster-based design approach.  This approach features designs that are more reflective of the social, cultural, economic conditions of displaced populations, and minimizes alteration of site features compared to grid-based designs.  Because of this, and the resultant cost savings, USAID/OFDA insisted on incorporation of the cluster-design approach in the 2003 revisions of the Sphere Project Guidelines.  The approach has been used extremely infrequently in a humanitarian context, however, and requires immediate assessment, as shelter needs are widespread and increasing, particularly in cities, and the cost differences of these two approaches in assisting similar populations are potentially significant, again on the order of 30-40 percent, or several million dollars per year.  A number of international humanitarian organizations and donors have expressed an interest in gaining a better understanding of the costs of developing and managing displaced persons settlements, which are a major form of shelter sector assistance, and USAID/OFDA is well-positioned to provide the humanitarian community with the needed information.


PRIMARY TASKS:
ï	Compare the overall and disaggregated costs of establishing displaced persons camps, to international standards, using both grid and cluster planning.

ï	Analyze the security and social impacts of grid and cluster planning through case studies of recent displaced persons camps and the model camp plans, interviews of humanitarian workers, a review of available literature.

ï	Develop a report that provides conclusions about impacts and options presented by grid and cluster planning.  Report will consider the impacts of cross-cutting issues such as security, livelihoods, gender, the environment, and sectoral impacts such as on water supply and health, and an analysis of the comparison of costs and security and social impacts.


ACTIVITIES: 
Travel to selected headquarters of international agencies, NGOs, and universities with experience/expertise in developing and managing displaced persons camps to access project files and interview relevant staff.  Given the potential sensitivity of this activity, contractor will have to provide evidence of prior experience in accessing project files and relevant staff with the same, or similar, institutions as part of related shelter sector assessment activities.  Contractor will identify organizations to be visited and submit a travel plan with the proposal.  Travel will be reimbursed based on actual expenses.  Per diem will not exceed US State Department rates.

ï	Review existing literature, involving primary research at the headquarters of humanitarian organizations, and a review of standards and guidelines;

ï	Conduct an analysis of situation reports and project material on displaced persons camps;

ï	Develop a study model or study models, involving a narrative situation history, with phasing, a description of physical conditions, and assumptions about the management of the construction and running of the camp or camps, costs for materials labor and plant, and the skills and methods of construction labor;

ï	Design and plan a prototypical displaced persons camp or camps in ëgridí form, in response to the study model or study models developed, with full cost accounting and a history of phased project development;

ï	Design and plan a prototypical displaced persons camp or camps in ëclusterí form, in response to the study model or study models developed, with full cost accounting and a history of phased project development;

ï	Conduct a thorough comparison of the plans and costs developed, in addition to an analysis and conclusions consistent with the report scope;

Detailed methodologies for the project will be developed in coordination with USAID/OFDA.  Detailed discussion of methodologies will be included in the final report, together with all relevant assumptions.  The model grid and cluster camp plans will follow USAID/OFDA, Sphere, and UNHCR standards and guidance, and will refer to current best practice.  The comparative cost analysis will be disaggregated, and conclusions will be drawn as to which aspects of displaced persons camp planning are impacted by the different planning approaches.


DELIVERABLES AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS:
Monthly and ongoing reporting of findings:  The contractor will provide a monthly status report, and will report via informal means such as e-mail, phone calls, and faxes on a more frequent basis, when required.  To the extent possible, monthly reports will be linked to specific tasks, subject to further discussion with OFDA.

Final Project Report:  A Final Project Report will be submitted to USAID/OFDA by April 15, 2005. The final report will include a summary of project activities, major findings, recommendations, analytic tools, and detailed discussion of methodologies. 

In addition to formal submission to OFDA, and subject to approval by OFDA, the final report will be as follows:
ï	Identify a peer review group, members of which will be approved by DCHA/OFDA.  Distribute draft copies of the report to each member the group for review and comment;
ï	Present report conclusions to relevant bodies such as the Sphere Project and UNHCR, as well as the publishers of manuals such as RedR; 
ï	Provide final report to USAID/OFDA in an electronic format appropriate for posting for download on the internet.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:

Contractor will have demonstrated institutional capacity and past performance in designing, building, and managing displaced persons settlements, as well as assessing performance of various shelter sector activities;

Contractor will have established relationships with international agencies, NGOs, and universities and research institutions engaged in humanitarian shelter activities, specifically the construction and management of displaced persons camps;


Key Personnel will possess the following minimum qualifications:

Minimum of a graduate degree in architecture, urban planning, urban design, or environmental management and design;

At least eight (8) years of professional experience, of which at least five (5) years in humanitarian community activities, specifically field experience in emergency and transitional shelter responses.  Work experience in both Non-Governmental Organizations and international agencies;

Experience in emergency, transitional, and reconstruction phase shelter activities;

Quantitative analysis skills and demonstrated excellence in analytic, written, and oral communication;

Demonstrated involvement with other humanitarian community shelter specialists in both field and conference/workshop settings;


SELECTION CRITERIA:
Selection will be based on the following:
ï	Relevant education and humanitarian community experience of key personnel;
ï	Program description;
ï	Ability to build upon existing organizational relationships to readily access information, form peer review panels, and generate awareness and support for project activities;
ï	Cost, cost realism in relation to proposed work, and identification of any in-kind contributions that would complement USAID/OFDA funding.

Desk Study Report for Ethiopia Aluto-Langano Project
For U.S. Trade and Development Agency -Contract TDA2004-10024A
March 2004-Submitted by:INTRATECH, Inc.-1350 Beverly Road,McLean, Virginia 22101,Tel No: (703) 680 2192
USTDA has included only parts of Intratech's desk study report in this RFP.
Project Description. The Aluto-Langano Geothermal Pilot Power Plant (ALGPPP) The ALGPPP is the first geothermal power plant to generate electricity in Ethiopia. The designed power output of the pilot plant is 8.52 MW (gross) and 7.28 MW (net).  Nevertheless, due to problems described below, the current power output is less than two MW.  The pilot power plant is supplied with steam and brine from four production wells (LA3, LA4, LA6 and LA8) at between 2000 m and 2500 m depth.  There is one re-injection well (LA7), which is an original field exploration well. The working fluid in the binary units is iso-pentane.  Ambient air is the cooling media for the condenser in both units.  The ALGPPP is composed of two separate units.  The first unit, the Geothermal Combined Cycle Unit (GCCU), is comprised of two subsystems, a back pressure steam turbine using geothermal steam and a binary type unit with pentane as its working fluid.  After the steam expands in the backpressure turbine, the remaining heat is fed into the binary unit that creates additional power.  The GCCU uses the higher-pressure outputs from wells LA3 and LA6.  The second unit, known as the ORMAT Energy Conversion unit, is a binary type unit that uses the output from the lower pressure wells LA4 and LA8. Ormat handed over the Power plant to EEPCo in June 30, 1998.  Since that time, the power plant has exhibited problems that have resulted in the shutdown of the installation.  The problems include: Fluctuation of the output of the wells; Decline of overall well outputs; Scaling; Wellhead valve lockups; Sand, rock, mud deposition from well LA-8; Cracking of the wellhead civil engineering structures; Premature wearing of the cooling tower fan shafts and belts; Pentane leakage from the Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) unit;Interference between the operation of wells LA-3 and LA-6; Excess geothermal fluid drainage to a surface pond;Overly high level of automation of the power plant that prevents manual operation in case of computer malfunction;Failure of feed pump to the OEC unit to recycle pentane fluid;Small size of the site and wellhead rock mufflers that results in the overflow of accumulated brine;Issues related to the 15kv transmission line, communication system, operational monitoring system and location of dwelling areas;Inadequate training of the project staff;Lack of spare parts.  U.S. Export Potential-The ìEast Africa Geothermal Market Acceleration Conferenceî held in Nairobi Kenya in April 2003 (co-funded by TDA) identified a number of projects in the East African Region.  Cumulatively these projects amounted to a total of 120 MW.    We estimate that this represents a potential market for U.S Exports of approximately $180 million.  The major components will be steam turbines, generators and switchgear, instrumentation and engineering and management. For the immediate rehabilitation of the Aluto-Langano Power Plant, our discussion with ORMAT indicates that total spare parts needed for rehabilitation will be of the order of $100,000. G. Foreign Competition-Foreign geothermal Technology ñ Israel, Italy, New Zealand.Engineering, Goods and Services-Foreign supply of hardware and service can be expected to very competitive in the East African Region.  Aggressive competition can be expected from Europe (Italy, France) and Asia (Japan and Korea) for high tech material i.e. rotating equipment, instrumentation, electrical and specialty valves fitting etc.    For less specialized equipment i.e. piping, civil, piping and structural India, South Africa and regional suppliers will be the major competition.L. Terms of Reference-The EEPCO Tender -On December 3, 2003, EEPCO issued a Tender Document for Consultancy Services that is   open only to international geothermal companies and will be financed by EEPCO without external assistance.  The objectives of the tender are to: Assess the status, solutions and costs to bring the plant back to its 7. 28 MWe design capacity to supply the nearby Adami Tulu substation and provide backup power for the national grid. Confirm the suspected 30 MW capacity of the Aluto resource and plan for its exploitation to that level. Additional objectives of the tender include: Plan a site laboratory for assessing geothermal fluids and other resource parameters; Prepare specifications and bid documents for the actual rehabilitation work Provide assistance to EEPCO during the bidding process to respond to inquiries, issue addenda, etc. Evaluate bid submissions and assist EEPCO in contract negotiations with the successful bidder; Supervise the rehabilitation work carried out by the successful bidder; Commission the rehabilitation work upon completion; In order to carry out the work, the successful bidder is expected to set up, staff and equip an office in Addis Ababa, and purchase a vehicle as well as testing and monitoring equipment.  The complete tender document is attached. Objectives of the Present Technical Assistance (TA) Program-The Consultant will assist EEPCO to review bids received in response to its international tender and select and negotiate a contract with the winning geothermal contractor to carry out a study the results of which will guide EEPCO in its efforts to (a) return the ALGPPP to its operating specifications as designed on a sustainable basis and (b) assess the potential for increased power generation from the Aluto resource.
