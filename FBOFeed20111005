<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Center - Fort Sam Houston (FSH) intends to issue a solicitation for the U.S. Army Wounded Soldier and Family Call Center for the U.S. Army Medical Command Medical Assistance Group (MMAG) located at Fort Sam Houston, TX.  The Chief of Staff of the Army activated The Wounded Soldiers and Family Hotline (WSFH) in 2007. The purpose of the WSFH is two-fold: 1) To offer wounded, injured, and ill Soldiers and family members a way to share concerns on the quality of patient care and 2) To provide Senior Army leaders with visibility on medically-related issues so they can properly allocate resources to better serve Soldiers and families. The contractor shall perform call center operation services, including performance of day to day operations for the Army Wounded Soldier and Family Hotline program under MMAG. The contractor shall provide personnel to service a 24 hour hotline 7 days a week with incoming call volume estimated at approximately 200 calls per week. The contractor shall utilize the toll free call line to respond to Army families, Soldiers, Retirees, Veterans, and Disabled Soldiers (beneficiaries) who are seeking information, or medical administrative issues.  Specific areas of expertise include, but are not limited to, superb communication skills, call center and customer service operations; knowledge of Soldier and Family member issues/concerns and the skills needed to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of processing the caller's request for assistance. Previous military experience, specifically Army Medical Department knowledge, is desirable. The contractor is responsible for preparing workload/caseload reports, providing analysis and trending reports, preparing information papers and other reports as requested by the MMAG. In addition, the contractor shall market the WSFH existence and functions to inform the military community they serve. The Government may identify other Soldier program initiatives involving call center capabilities or services during the period of performance.  This is a follow-on requirement. The current contract is W91WAW-08-C-0006.  The designated NAICS Code is 561110, Office Administrative Services, with a size standard of $7.0 million.  This acquisition anticipates a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside.  The contract type is FFP.  The Government anticipates a contract length of a 12 month base period and three (3) one-year option periods.  The solicitation and resultant contract will contain FAR 52.217-8, Extension of Services, which will be evaluated as part of the contract.  However, the extension period is not reflected in the period of performance.  The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) utilizing FAR Part 15, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  The Government anticipates release of the solicitation on or about 28 October 2011, with a projected closing date of 28 November 2011.  These are projected dates and are subject to change.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's intent to contract with a selected firm using single source procedures.
The FAA has a requirement to procure test, evaluation, and additional research and development engineering service tasks to support changes to the FAA-LAAS Standards on the FAA owned Honeywell SLS-4000 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Landing System (GLS) test bed.  To support this work, modifications  to support Category III LAAS are being tested using a Category I based system in order to test Fail-Down requirements from Category III to Category I. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) modifications to the SLS-4000 are necessary to improve availability and reliability of the CAT III LGF signal in the presence of spurious interference sources.  Modifications are necessary for the testing required for the Category III LAAS.
The SLS-4000 is a Honeywell product and the software and hardware designs are proprietary to Honeywell.  Accordingly, only Honeywell has the necessary design documentation, system knowledge, and experience to make the modifications to the SLS-4000.
A competitive solicitation will not be available for this procurement.  All questions or concerns should be directed to Colleen McLaughlin-Heasty via e-mail at Colleen.McLaughlin-Heasty@faa.gov not later than 2:00 EST 13 October 2011. 
The FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this announcement.
Note:  Funds are not presently available for this requirement.  The FAA's obligation under this requirement is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for this contract can be made.  No legal liability on the part of FAA for payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this requirement and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Newtown Square, PA intends to initiate a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement action and award a Firm-Fixed Price contract for Custodial-Janitorial services. The Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, supervision, transportation, and operating supplies to perform the services at the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station in Morgantown, West Virginia. <br /><br />The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12, Commercial Items, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). A Firm-Fixed-Price contract will be awarded for a period of twelve (12) months (Base Year), with four (4) one-year (12-month) Option Periods to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the lowest price technically acceptable and falls within the competitive price range. The contract period, including the Base Year, and four Option Years (if exercised) will be from approximately December 1, 2011 to November 30, 2016. Proposals will be reviewed for completeness and evaluated for acceptability against the following evaluation factors: Past Performance; Experience; and Price. Price is more important than non-cost factors; however non-cost factors are significant to award. The Government may elect to conduct discussions with offerors whose proposals are technically acceptable (or which may be expected to be made acceptable by moderate modification) and fall within the competitive price range. The Government reserves the right, however, to award a contract based on initial offers without conducting discussions. Therefore, each proposal should be submitted from the offeror's most favorable technical and price standpoints.

<CONTACT>Jorge E. Rosario, Contract Specialist, Phone 202 685 5951, Fax 202-685-5965, Email jorge.rosario@navy.mil - Stefani M Nick, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-685-5962, Fax 202-685-5965, Email stefani.nick@navy.mil
<DESC>Background: The Military Sealift Command (MSC) is responsible for providing combat logistics support to Department of Navy (DON) ships at sea, and providing strategic transportation of ocean cargo as part of the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). MSC is unique because it has administrative responsibility to both the DON and to USTRANSCOM. It therefore operates two separate Working Capital Fund (WCF) accounts - the Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) and Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) - each of which is funded from revenue generated from a buyer-seller relationship with its customers. While MSC has resources that support both of these funds, it must submit separate budgets and Program Objective Memorandum (POM) costs for each WCF. MSC currently uses Budget Preparation System (BPS) to formulate, review, and produce the MSC budget and Program Objective Memorandum (POM) for its portion of the NWCF and TWCF budgets. Although BPS has met many of the requirements needed to produce the budget/POM, its technology is outdated and lacks the flexibility and functionality needed for management analysis and ease of budget/POM preparation. An MSC corporate initiative is to replace its current budget formulation system. <br /><br />
<p>Objectives: MSC has a need to implement a new budget formulation system (herein "MBPFS") that will modernize MSC's budget development process. MBPFS shall support MSC's Comptroller Directorate (N8), Business Program Offices, Headquarters (MSCHQ) and its subordinate commands to improve their ability to efficiently and effectively develop, analyze, produce and justify MSC's budget/POM requests. MBPFS is expected to reduce the administrative burden on N8 staff, eliminate duplicate entry of budget/POM information into multiple systems, improve the analysis and justification of MSC programs, and produce required budgetary exhibits.</p>
<p>Scope: Using the Hyperion system MSC has selected as its new budget formulation software, the Contractor shall implement a solution that meets the functional and technical requirements identified in the forth-coming solicitiation. The target users of the proposed budget/POM formulation application are the N8 Headquarters staff and regional office staff involved in the budget formulation process.<br /><br />This acquisition will be full and open. The resulting order will be firm fixed priced. The solicitation resulting from this notice will be available on FBO and <a href="http://www.msc.navy.mil">www.msc.navy.mil</a>.</p>

This option covers an extended period of performance of approximately six months that will run from 1 February 2012 through 31 July 2012. This procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to expire 31 January 2012 and these services must be continued through award of the ongoing source selection for the competitive follow-on task order. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently being performed under contract N00421-07-C-0013, BAE is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The incumbent contractor (BAE) has fully trained personnel and a fully developed management system in place for execution of the required work. Resolicitation for the six month period would not only result in a break in service, but would incur excessive costs to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. For information contact Rhonda Garcia, Code 2.5.1.2.4.3, via email: rhonda.garcia@navy.mil.</p>
<p>BAE Systems Technology Solutions &amp; Services<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-no-proof: yes"> is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating an impact on fielded systems, sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness as a result of a break in service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive task order award.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a modification on a sole source basis under existing NAVSEA contract N00024-09-C-6306 with Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), 444 Salomon Circle, Sparks, NV to procure additional 200 Dismounted Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) 3.1 Systems, initial spares and consumables, depot spares, and engineering support services hours.  The additional quantities are needed to support current urgent Department of Defense requirements. 

The Government contracted as a result of limited competition for Dismounted CREW Spiral 3.1 Systems.  Three competitive awards were made in DEC 07 for an estimated 2,500 combined to SNC.
 

SNC is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the dismounted CREW systems (Thor III) that are currently being used by U.S. forces around the world. The Commander, Marine Corps Central Command (MARCENT), has an urgent need for additional 200 systems to augment the dismounted systems currently in theater. Because of the urgent need of this requirement, soliciting from other offerors will lead to unacceptable delay in fulfilling this requirement. Thus, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (d) (1) (B) and Subpart 6.302-1, only SNC can satisfy the Governments requirement and no other substitute will be acceptable. 

To meet potential additional future requirements, NAVSEA is currently working with PMS-408 for a full and open IDIQ type contract for dismounted CREW systems.
 The Government anticipates providing more information on this potential requirement by Third Quarter Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 12. Please check FedBizOps for additional information. 

NAVSEA anticipates releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the First Quarter Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 12 and awarding the modification to this contractor in the second Quarter GFY 12.  It is anticipated that firm fixed price, cost plus fixed fee, and cost only, CLINs will result from this award.  

The delivery period will begin six months after issuance of modification.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<ARCHDATE>10212011
<CONTACT>Camille M. Timmerman, Phone 3014436851, Email camille.timmerman@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate a contract with Trans Management Systems Corporation located in Washington, DC on a sole source basis for the Administration of Children and Families (ACF)/Office of Head Start (OHS) for Head Start knowledge, information and publications management services, herein referred to as HSKIMS. The acquisition is for an interim contract for a 6 month period, with an option to extend services for up to an additional 6 months, if necessary. This interim contract is crucial to give the Government time to complete a competitive procurement. <br /><strong><br />Purpose</strong> - The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start (OHS) requires the continuity of the Head Start Knowledge and Information Management Services (HSKIMS) while a new competitive procurement is underway. The Head Start program is authorized under Public Law 110-134 "Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007." The purpose of Head Start is to promote the school readiness of low-income children by enhancing their cognitive, social, and emotional development in a learning environment that supports children's growth in language, literacy, mathematics, science, social and emotional functioning, creative arts, physical skills, and approaches to learning; and through the provision to low-income children and their families of health, educational, nutrition, social, and other services that are determined, based on family needs assessments, to be necessary. <br /><strong><br />Background</strong> - This project is an interim follow-on of contract #HHSP23320062910YC which was awarded to Trans Management Systems Corporation. HSKIMS supports the OHS by managing information services relevant to the program linked to maintaining and maturing a large public/private website (www.eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov) that provides critical policy, guidance and technical assistance information to Head Start programs, prospective parents, the early childhood community, and the general public. Services include public inquiries numbering in the thousands per month, communication and materials dissemination, and conference management for ACF and OHS. It is vital to the OHS and to the Head Start community that serves over one million children and their families each year that there is no disruption of these critical services and that there is a smooth transition into a new contract.<br /><strong><br />Summary of Approach</strong> -
<p>The HSKIMS currently supports the OHS through provision of the following services:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content Management</span><br /><br />-Early Childhood Learning and Knowledge Center (ECLKC) (http://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov) <br />&nbsp; -Nearly 5,000 pages and 2 million visits per year<br />&nbsp; -Numerous file formats including streaming video<br />&nbsp; -508 compliant<br />&nbsp; -Private communities, web service-based directories, online lessons<br />&nbsp; -Hosting of production, development and failover systems, trends and analytics <br /><br />-OHS website (http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs)<br />&nbsp; -All ACF program websites are being redesigned and the contractor would be responsible to implement and maintain the site as necessary</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer Service Help Desk</span><br />-1500-4000 unique inquiries per month; primarily from prospective parents and the public, including at least 1/3 from Spanish speakers<br />-Management of knowledge base</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Publications Management</span><br />-Warehousing and dissemination of hard copy publications - average 50,000 pieces of varying sizes with differing amounts throughout the year<br />-Management of Office of Public Affairs clearance for all OHS materials<br />-Electronic archive<br />-Publications layout and development</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conference Outreach and Display<br /></span>-Booth staffing and materials management at 25-50 conferences/training events and over 120,000 pieces disseminated per year</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">News Search<br /></span>-Conduct daily web-based search of online news media and report to OHS on issues of note regarding Head Start and early childhood in local, state, and regional news</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mass Communications and Social Media<br /></span>-High-volume (over 10,000) eblast services and RSS feeds; lists maintenance as required by OHS<br />-Manage and/or link to social media such as Facebook, Twitter as determined by OHS</p>
<p>The contractor proposed is currently providing OHS the services described above. The contractor has managed this large operation for more than five years and has the necessary staffing and capacity currently in place to continue necessary services while the follow-on contract is compete.</p>
<p>OHS carefully analyzed the current services to determine whether the current work could be accomplished through another method. The analysis indicated that the current contractor is uniquely knowledgeable and staffed to provide interim services in the specific areas identified. Transitioning to a new contractor for interim support will result in a lapse in service and unacceptable risk to the Head Start program for the following services:</p>
<p><strong>Websites:<br /></strong>The ECLKC is OHS' primary vehicle for sharing resources and information with the early childhood community. Being a federal to local effort, OHS is a complex organization with many divisions and branches. There are daily postings of all types of media from numerous contributors, including six large collaborative national centers, to the websites. HSKIMS has the staff, technical background in the use of the Hyperwave platform, taxonomy knowledge of the website that hosts well over 5,000 pages, and communication structures with numerous content and technical contractors and contributors to accommodate this while meeting HHS requirements such as 508 compliance.</p>
<p>The ACF OHS website is in the process of being redesigned. The new design relies heavily on content within the ECLKC and requires feeds and webservices from the site. This is scheduled for Phase I launch in December 2011 and no other contractor could accomplish this in the necessary timeframe. As part of the family of ACF sites our role in this launch is critical. In addition, OHS anticipates a new regulation on designation renewal will be published in the near future. At that time certain portions of the website will become dedicated to advertising competitions, providing information for potential offerors, etc. and this will need to happen quickly to meet Congress' intent for the process.</p>
<p><strong>Dissemination Services:<br /></strong>HSKIMS manages numerous large email dissemination lists that have, over time, been customized to reach audiences in the tens of thousands with different types of firewalls, etc. The content of the emails and social media dissemination is generally also posted to the websites so can be accomplished simultaneously. Any contractor other than the contractor proposed could not scale up in time and critical communications with grantees and others would be disrupted.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service Help Desk and News Search:<br /></strong>HSKIMS has built up internal staff knowledge about Head Start regulations and requirements to quickly respond on a factual way to numerous and varied inquiries. Most of these inquiries are specialized in nature and cannot be answered by simply quoting a regulation. While some answers are contained in a knowledge base, the ability of the staff to respond in a timely way is an important service to the public. In response to a recent GAO report, a complaint hotline was set up that HSKIMS also staffs, and disruptions to this service would not be acceptable.</p>
<p>OHS recognized a need to increase awareness of serious risks to federal funds and health and safety risks as reported to the local media. After scouring numerous sources for an effective search tool and coming up short, HSKIMS offers specialized daily news media searches for OHS. The results are communicated directly to OHS for follow up. Disruption to this service would mean a higher risk that OHS would be unaware of serious issues in programs. A service of this type will be included in the next competition but could not be in place in the interim without this contractor's specialized knowledge.<br />A contractor other than Trans Management Systems Corporation would not be able to meet the objectives of this interim contract or adequately and effectively provide the required services in an expedited time-frame. If there is a lapse in services it will affect OHS's ability to conduct a competitive re-compete of the requirement.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-3, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing that they can meet the Government's requirement. Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy the stated requirements. The written statements of capability should be emailed to the Contract Specialist, Camille Timmerman, at Camille.Timmerman@psc.hhs.gov and are due no later than 5:00PM EST October 20, 2011. Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source award to Trans Management Systems Corporation. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation document is available. The purpose of this announcement is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.</p>

<SUBJECT>USAF Tactical Hyperspectral Roadmap Initiative Request for Information
<SOLNBR>FA8620-12-R-4001
<RESPDATE>110411
<CONTACT>Andrew M. Smith, Phone 937-255-6898, Email andrew.smith@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>ASC/WIN is developing a 10 year roadmap for the development, production and deployment of a family of airborne tactical hyperspectral systems. It is anticipated the sensor system frequencies addressed in the roadmap would be primarily in the Visible to Near-Infrared, Shortwave- Infrared, Medium-wave Infrared, and Longwave-Infrared frequencies (0.4 - 15 &micro;m). The sensors would be deployed on airborne platforms operating at various altitudes to support specific operational conditions. ASC/WIN is conducting market research to identify what research has been accomplished in this field as well as to see what technology currently exists or could be modified for this need. This market research will potentially shape Air Force efforts in the FY14-24 timeframe. ASC/WIN seeks industry White Papers to support this market research effort by&nbsp;4 Nov&nbsp;11.
<p>The intent of this RFI is to identify candidate programs and technology efforts related to the development of hyperspectral sensors and associated data algorithms. Components related to hyperspectral sensors include, but are not limited to: electronics, gimbals, cryogenics, diffraction gratings, focusing lenses, ROICs, atmospheric and temperature correction algorithms/techniques, airborne and ground processing, interference filters, spectrometer, HRI subsystems, etc.). These components do not need to be part of an existing sensor system; research and development of these components may be ongoing independent of a full system. Responses are sought from industry, academia, Government agencies, and military services. Current research should indicate the Technology Readiness Level of the system or component.</p>
<p>ASC/WIN desires this market research reach across industry, academia, and service/government programs for candidate programs/technology efforts with projected capabilities that may maximize our current and future airborne HSI sensors. Candidate technologies should, if needed, project modifications or upgrades, forecast improvements or apply a new technology process in order to meet operational goals. The following ground rules/assumptions apply:</p>
<p>&bull; For solely component technologies - clearly explain how the component will benefit an HSI system <br />&bull; Responses should identify any new supporting architecture or infrastructure (i.e., cryogenics, processing, ground control, communications, etc.) required for the technology.</p>
<p><br />All correspondence submitted will be controlled as proprietary. After reviewing the submitted White Papers, the Government may request technical exchanges and/or site surveys of respondent's facilities. At the request of the submitter, the Government will provide feedback concerning the information submitted.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the resulting hyperspectral roadmap will be used to plan and program the required efforts to support hyperspectral objectives. Upon completion of the roadmap, ASC/WIN anticipates the required development and integration tasks will be competitively selected and awarded.</p>
<p>==============</p>
<p>The Government invites industry to submit White Papers (unclassified or classified up to TOP SECRET) on their concepts or technologies at any time on or before&nbsp;<strong>4 Nov&nbsp;11</strong>. Guidance on the suggested White Paper format is attached. Please ensure all appropriate security procedures and policies are followed when responding to this RFI. Please restrict page count to no more than 15 pages in length and submit electronically or via mail (regular mail for UNCLASSIFIED; Registered mail for SECRET only) to the points of contact stated below.</p>
<p>The Point of Contact for submittal of white papers and any technical questions is: <br /><br />Capt Rebecca Breiding, ASC/WIN<br />2530 Loop Road West, Room 144 <br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433-7101</p>
<p>FAX: 937-656-4445 <br />E-mail addresses: <br />UNCLASSIFIED email: HSIRoadmap@wpafb.af.mil<br />SECRET email via SIPRNet: Rebecca.breiding@afmc.af.smil.mil <br />TOP SECRET email via JWICS: Rebecca.breiding@afmc.ic.gov</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement. Submitting capabilities and concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall not be compensated.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer is Ms. Sally (Sara) Meyer, ASC/WINK, and is available by telephone at (937) 255-5011 or email at sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil. Parties interested in responding to this RFI must notify the Contracting Officer by email of their intent to participate within seven (7) days of published announcement in FedBizOpps. <strong>When emailing the Contracting Officer a notice of intent to participate, use the following subject line: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"FA8620-12-R-4001, Intent: (<em>Company Name</em>)."</span></strong> Do not send the White Paper to this email address; send only the notice of intent to respond. The notice of intent to participate is the only correspondence that should be sent to this email address. Repeat: The White Paper should be sent to one of the three addresses for unclassified, secret, and top secret correspondence, as appropriate.</p>

<DESC>Subject: Optical Component(s) for the YAG Laser
The US Army Armament Research and Development Command (ARDEC) Benet Laboratories, located at Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, New York is seeking firms capable of a technical solution for one or both of the requirements described below.
The requirement entails the delivery of a uniform beam of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser onto a target to achieve a desired range of fluences (fluence = pulse energy per unit area).  The output from the laser is non-uniform, both due to hot spots on the beam and due to intensity rings associated with the laser operating in a multi-mode configuration to maximize energy.  The laser produces 5 ns pulses in a circular spot that is approximately 11 mm in diameter.  The laser is operated at the second (532 nm) or third (355 nm) harmonics of the fundamental YAG output at 1064 nm.  The pulse energy is 800 mJ at 532 nm, and 500 mJ at 355 nm.  

An optical element or system of components is sought that can accomplish the following two objectives:  (a) Transform the incident beam into a square or circular beam at the target, with a top-hat intensity profile, with a uniformity of 5% or less.  (b) Adjust the fluence of the beam on the target, either by changing the spot size or attenuating the energy in the beam at constant spot size (preferred).  Desired fluence range shall cover at least 0.1  3 J/cm2.  
**A response may address either or both of the objectives.
The solution must be compatible with the optical arrangement depicted in Attachment 1.  The beam travels horizontally on an optical table, and is turned down onto a target which routinely sits in a vacuum chamber.  The height of the beam relative to the table is 206 mm.  The front surface of the coated window into the chamber is approximately 180 mm from the surface of the optical table.  The target is approximately 120 mm from the surface of the table.  The window is fused silica, AR-coated for 355 nm and 532 nm, with a damage threshold of approximately 5 J/cm2, which should not be exceeded by the beam in traversal to the target.  The turning mirror will be a 25.4 mm or 50.8 mm fused silica mirror, AR-coated for either 355 nm or 532 nm, with a damage threshold of 5 J/cm2.  Optical components may be placed anywhere within the beam path, but the damage threshold of these two optical components must not be exceeded.
The vacuum chamber sits on a moving stage with a throw of 150 mm in all in-plane directions.  Thus, the objective solution should recommend a mechanism for holding the optical system or components given that the stage will likely need to move under the optics themselves.
Several beam input scenarios are contemplated:
1.   The direct output from the laser at 532 nm.2.   The output from the laser when passed through an Engineered Diffuser (e.g. ThorLabs P/N ED1-S20-POG-SP).  This output scenario results in a beam that is highly divergent, but that can be collimated.3.  The output of the laser after the light is passed through a 400 micron diameter pinhole placed at the focus of a lens.  This removes the rings of the direct output beam, but still retains some inhomogeneity.
Possible solutions for (a) could include a micro-lens array, an absorptive diffuser, a diffractive diffuser, or any number of other approaches. Possible solutions for (b) could include a telescope or a continuously variable attenuator.
Attachments: Optical arrangement depicted in Attachment 1.Representative images for these three scenarios are provided in Attachment 2.  

Firms/companies are invited to indicate their capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, demonstration video and other technical data.  All data should be sent at no cost to the US Government by October 24, 2011 to the US Army ARDEC. ATTN: Katelyn Warren email: Katelyn.a.warren@us.army.mil.  In addition, please provide the firms name and address, point of contact with telephone number and email address, and size of business (small/large). The Government will accept written questions by email. This is a market survey to be used for informational planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is the Government obligated to issue an RFP. The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Sources Sought and Informational Site Visit for Debris Collection and Removal Services on the Upper Columbia River, Grand Coulee Project, WA
Later this year, the Bureau of Reclamation intends to issue a solicitation for a contract for the operation and maintenance of a series of log booms for the collection and disposal of floating debris on Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) Lake.  FDR Lake was formed by the impoundment of the Columbia River behind the Grand Coulee Dam.  The work sites are at the upper end of FDR Lake near the town of Kettle Falls, Washington, which is approximately 80 miles North/Northwest of Spokane, Washington.  The site may not be accessible at the time offers may be solicited and received, so we are conducting a site visit this fall so potential offerors can inspect the site conditions, access in and out of the site, etc.  The informational site visit for the work described below will be held on Tuesday, October 25, 2011.
WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO ATTEND THIS SITE VISIT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN COMPETING FOR THE CONTRACT WHEN THE REQUIREMENT IS SOLICITED. 
COMPETITION:  This action will most likely be an unrestricted, full and open competition and will not be set-aside for any classification of small business concerns.
AWARD TYPE: Any subsequent contract will be Fixed Price.  The term of the contract has not been determined but may be solicited on a yearly basis, or possibly a base year and 4 option years.  Information gathered from this site visit and through the pre-solicitation process will help make the decision on how this contract will be awarded.
PREVAILING WAGE: A Service Contract Act Prevailing Wage may apply to any award issued by this solicitation process.  At the time of solicitation, the current wage determination, occupational code and title will be added.
DATES:Informational Site Visit: October 25, 2011
Estimated Pre-solicitation issue date: November 3, 2011
Estimated Solicitation issue date: December 1, 2011Estimated Offer due date: December 30, 2011
Estimated Award date: Early 2012
EVALUATION FACTORS:The Government will award a contract resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors.  The following factors may be used to to evaluate offers (subject to minor revision at time of solicitation):
1. Technical Approach (method)2. Past Performance (how well you've performed)3. Safety4. Experience (how much you've done)5. Key Personnel6. Equipment7. Price and Other Price-related factors
The technical approach is individually more important than past performance, safety, experience, key personnel and equipment.  Past performance, safety and experience are of equal importance and individually are important than key personnel and equipment.  Key personnel and equipment are of equal value.  Factors 1 through 6, when combined are more important than price and price-related factors.
DESCRIPTION OF WORK:Reclamation has two debris collection sites and one debris removal site on the Columbia River near Kettle Falls, WA.  The two collection sites are location at China Bar (approximately River Mile 724) and at the mouth of the Kettle River (approximately River Mile 707).  The disposal site is at Boise Cove, downstream from the mouth of the Kettle River (approximately River Mile 702).  The collection sites use log booms to capture floating debris.  The floating debris consists of logs, snags, and slash from up-river logging, uprooted trees and brush from riverbank undercutting, miscellaneous debris, and garbage.  Historically, the debris has been constrained with log booms and towed to Boise Cove for removal.  Depending on the lake level, a concrete boat ramp at Boise Cove allows a contractor easy access for removing debris.  Once out of the water the debris becomes the property of the contractor.  Reclamation does not have land locations for the permanent storage of debris.
The China Bar debris collection site consists of a 2,070-foot main earthen dike, a 1,600-foot auxiliary earthen dike, and a number of log booms.  The North, Middle, and South log booms form a string of boom logs that remove debris from the current of the river in a shearing action and together are referred to as the shear boom.  The 2,500-foot North Main Boom consists of a double string of boom logs; each boom log is approximately 33 feet long.  The 950-foot Middle Main Boom consists of a double string of boom logs.  The 2,500-foot South Main Boom consists of a single string of boom logs.  There is a holding area log boom for storage of debris diverted by the main shear boom and a safety log boom to ensure that debris doesn't escape the collection facility.  Government-furnished facilities include storage buildings, a small work shop, basic sanitary facilities, and a small building for day-time use.
The Kettle River debris collection boom is located in FDR Lake at the mouth of the Kettle River.  It consists of single-string log booms totaling about 4,500 feet in length and spanning the mouth of the Kettle River.  There is a permanent opening in the log boom for public navigation when the lake elevation is above 1,255 feet.  An additional single string of boom logs, approximately 2,800 feet long, forms a liner along the main section of the collection area of the log boom for additional strength to hold collected debris.  It is used to encircle the debris to hold it in place after the collection period and to tow the debris to Boise Cove.
The Boise Cove site is located on Lake Roosevelt and is adjacent to Boise Cascade Corporation's log storage yard.  It consists of a log boom of about 45 boom logs in a single string, enclosing a majority of the river cove.  This log boom is used to store bagged debris on the inside.  Government and Contractor flotilla is usually moored around the perimeter.  A concrete access ramp is used for debris removal.  The access ramp must have a lake elevation of approximately 1,275 feet or above for equipment to reach the debris.
The Contractor will have to work with changing river level, current, and velocity in order to maintain and manipulate the log booms, anchors, and buoys for efficient debris collection, debris breach protection, and moorage of flotilla.  Hazardous operating conditions may be encountered on the upper Columbia River.  The Contractor also must maintain a few navigational lights.  Preparation for the debris collection season and for the Spring runoff begins April 1st.  Collection, monitoring, and maintenance is ongoing from April 1st, culminating with the removal of debris by November 30th.
PLEASE CONTACT PAULA COLLINS AT PHONE NUMBER 208-378-5110, FAX NUMBER 208-378-5108, OR E-MAIL  pcollins@usbr.gov, TO REGISTER TO ATTEND THE SITE VISIT.  YOU MUST REGISTER NO LATER THAN FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21ST AT 4 PM (MST) TO ATTEND THE SITE VISIT.  We will convene for the site visit in Kettle Falls at 9:00 am, Tuesday morning at the Chevron Gas and Go Minimart/Truck Stop at the intersection of Highways 25 and 395.  We anticipate that the site visit will take approximately 3 hours.  This site visit will give potential contractors the opportunity view the work sites during Fall conditions.  NO other site visit will be held.  Attendance at site visits is not mandatory, but highly encouraged.  

NOTE:Central Contractor Registration: Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is the primary registrant database for the U.S. Federal Government. CCR collects, validates, stores and disseminates data in support of agency acquisition missions. Contractors must be registered to be eligible for government awards.
Dun and Bradstreet: Dun & Bradstreet provides a D-U-N-S Number for each physical location of your business. D-U-N-S Number assignment is free for all businesses required to register with the federal government for contracts or grants.
Online Representations and Certifications Application: To be eligible for Government awards, contractors must be registered in ORCA. ORCA is an e-Government initiative that was designed by the Integrated Acquisition Environment to replace the paper-based Representations and Certifications process. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA.
Safety Handbook: Potential offerors are advised that the Department of Labor Safety and Health Regulations for Construction promulgated under section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety  Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327, et.seq.) and the Bureau of Reclamation handbook entitled Reclamation Safety and Health Standards" (RSHS) are applicable to the work under any resulting contract.  The RSHS is available at www.usbr.gov/pn.contracts.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; mso-add-space: auto">The contract support can in no way <span style="COLOR: black">significantly reduce system availability due to unfamiliarity with the GA-ASI MQ-9 system, including lack of specialized tooling and technical documentation to maintain or repair MQ-9 UAS components, as inability to meet necessary flight hour rates will appreciably impact National Security through decreased interdictions of contraband and increased risk to CBP ground units (e.g., Border Patrol agents), due to lack of overhead reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) support. Additionally, the contract support must be able to surge to support focus operations in land or maritime domains as required to meet National Security and disaster response requirements.</span></p>
<p>CBP OAM MQ-9 operations in the National Airspace System are considered public aircraft operations. As such, UAS operations are currently required to obtain a Federal Aviation Administration Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). The COA approval process requires a stringent review of UAS systems, procedures for normal and emergency operations, training, maintenance and other factors. To date, the OAM MQ-9 system has been granted multiple COAs for operations in the southwest border region, northern border region, southeast coastal border region, and other areas. The contract support must be in compliance with COA requirements and not jeopardize current CBP OAM COAs.</p>
<p>All responses should be received no later than 3:00 PM EST, October 12, 2011. Limited questions and comments will be entertained, and must be in writing via email, no telephone calls. The Government has only limited rights in the data for the MQ-9 UAS from GA-ASI, the OEM, and therefore will not be able to provide data to interested sources.</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. ISSUANCE OF THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY OBLIGATION ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE THESE SERVICES OR TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THE RFI AND RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AS OFFERS. ANY INFORMATION THE CONTRACTOR CONSIDERS PROPRIETARY SHOULD BE CLEARLY MARKED AS SUCH. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />October 5, 2011
<p>Request for Information - Portable Readiness Food Production Equipment - (PRFPE)</p>
<p>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support is seeking proposals from interested parties to develop a concept for an un-determined quantity of portable shelf stable readiness MRE/UGR (Meals Ready-to-Eat/Unitized Group Rations) production equipment.</p>
<p>This project is in support of the Operational Rations Program, for War Readiness Surge Capability, for portable field MRE/UGR fill/seal equipment and retorts.  Portable readiness field equipment MRE/UGR/Retort for production may be installed in multi-modal 40 foot cargo containers (aka sea vans).</p>
<p>In order to qualify, your firm must have experience in supporting the food processing business for shelf stable products, manufacturing, or design equipment via the retort processes.  Please indicate your experience or provide related government contract numbers with a brief description of items supplied when replying to this announcement.</p>
<p>The equipment must be placeable and easily removed from multi-modal 40 foot cargo containers.  The design is for a domestic application only.  Wheels that can lock in place or a motorized dolly system might be included for the specific pieces of equipment installed within the containers.</p>
<p>These containers will be used to transport the manufacturing equipment.  Multi-modal containers with expandable telescoping sides or drop down doors to allow equipment inside to be operated without removal will be considered.</p>
<p>The minimum requirements are:</p>
<p>&bull;	Two (2) gentle motion retorts that fit within the container with auto loading capabilities</p>
<p>&bull;	Two (2) sets of carts with two (2) sets of racks for MRE plus two (2) sets of racks for UGR tray retort placement</p>
<p>&bull;	One (1) MRE linear continuous motion fill/sealer with ultrasonic seal heads capable of producing 300-500 pouches per minute automatically or 60 pouches if hand fed</p>
<p>&bull;	One (1) UGR poly tray fill/sealer capable of producing 8-10 trays/minute</p>
<p>Product specifications for the end food items can be found at the following web link:</p>
<p>http://www.dscp.dla.mil/subs/support/specs/procure.asp</p>
<p>Current FDA and pressure vessel requirements must be maintained. This is a Phase 1 developmental concept requesting ideas to achieve performance in a portable environment.</p>
<p>Developed concepts need to address the following elements at a minimum:</p>
<p>1) Functional design of multi-modal container layout. Equipment shall be arranged in a manner which maintains food production and processing flow if used within the containers, if possible.  If no production occurs within the container, the design needs to address ease of unloading and setup of equipment.</p>
<p>2. Feed line concepts or conveyor systems for product on input and /output need to be designed if equipment is used within the containers.</p>
<p>3) Interior HVAC (Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning) is required if equipment is used within the containers.</p>
<p>4) Adequate task lighting is required in the containers.</p>
<p>5) Design concepts should include ideas for practical layout of the equipment within the containers for transportation. Tie-down points, blocking and bracing of equipment should be considered.</p>
<p>6) If equipment is used for production within the containers, abilities to work on the line must be identified. Adequate walkways must be maintained, allowing for operator safety and ease of entry and exit.</p>
<p>7) Design must meet and maintain necessary federal standards (i.e. OSHA regulations) for personnel safety while operating the equipment, if it is used within the containers.</p>
<p>8) Design of containers for ease of equipment movement in and out with minimal lifting capacity (i.e. standard forklift only) if equipment is not permanently installed within the containers.</p>
<p>7) If equipment is to be removed from the containers, include ideas for locking wheel application or motorized system for movement in/out of trailers (electric, hydraulic, etc.).</p>
<p>8) Recommend model types of production equipment to be purchased and/or supplied along with throughput of pouches/trays per hour.  Rates listed above are estimated and desired.</p>
<p>9) Design needs to accommodate one production type at a time, either MRE pouches or Poly trays.</p>
<p>10) Recommended support equipment such as electric generator, vacuum pump, air pump or other machinery in additional container.  <br /> <br />All items should be to US specifications for power and all controls identified in American English.  Equipment should be capable of easy movement in/out of the container for set-up in a food processing facility and/or capability for running product within the container at a food processing facility.</p>
<p>If equipment is operated within the container, it should have all the necessary connections accessible from the outside (including but not limited to power, water, air and data).</p>
<p>If items are to be removed from the containers, it shall require minimal installation within a plant facility. Connections should be designed for easy and quick assembly and disassembly.  The design for the equipment should allow movement into and out of the container with only a standard forklift.</p>
<p>Please provide a statement which describes in detail a concept of how your firm could design a system to achieve the goals listed above within the confines of a portable system.  DLA Troop Support wants to maintain flexibility to allow for a rapid deployment of the system to support readiness events thereby maintaining a quick ability to supplement a vendors' existing capacity.</p>
<p>Phase 1 is a concept phase for developing ideas and practical application to real life manufacturing problems.  Based on a review of the results by DLA Troop Support Subsistence Industrial Base Planning personnel, a<br />Phase 2 award might be funded for $20,000.00 for additional design and developmental work. Phase 2 funding would allow for further development of concepts. A possible Phase 3 could include funding for the construction of a prototype based on the responses to the general requirements listed above</p>
<p>Proposals may be submitted electronically at any time to Peter LaVerghetta at peter.laverghetta@dla.mil by the closing date of Friday, December 30, 2011.</p>
<p>Please e-mail or call Peter LaVerghetta at (215) 737-7502 for general questions on how to respond to this announcement.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."
<p>Background and Objectives:</p>
<p>The mission of the Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (LMIV) is to develop malaria vaccines. Clinical trials are needed to investigate initial safety, immunogenicity, and biologic impact of vaccine candidates. Clinical studies may also be conducted as part of pathogenesis research to facilitate vaccine development. The objective of this contract is to assist NIAID investigations and develop of malaria vaccines by examining the safety and immunologic responses to experimental vaccines and to experimental malaria infection in adult human subjects.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The Government requires that can perform malaria vaccine testing, challenge studies and infection research in humans. The contractor will also be involved in clinical protocol development. Potential successful offerors will need to demonstrate understanding of the relevant science/ issues related to vaccine testing and infectivity studies for the particular pathogens, posses appropriately trained and experienced personnel and the necessary facilities. Two species of pathogens are being considered for studies at this time; Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. However, the Government may require additional safety and monitoring procedures if the studies include parasites with enhanced virulence.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of Performance: One base year starting approximately in June/July of 2012, and including four 12 month option periods.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the Statement of Work using their best effort to perform clinical studies as follows:</p>
<p>1. Conduct a minimum of one staggered-start, dose escalating Phase 1a malaria vaccine trial in healthy malaria-na&iuml;ve adult volunteers. These &lsquo;first in human' vaccine studies will test the safety and immunogenicity of candidate malaria vaccines. Vaccines will be recombinant proteins formulated with one or more adjuvants; viral vectored vaccines and prime-boost regimens may also be tested. Trials will be done in an outpatient setting, except for challenge and experimental infection studies as outlined below. Trials typically will use 40-60 volunteers in escalating dose groups, with 3 vaccinations given over 3-6 months. Safety and immunological assessments (humoral and cellular) will take place after each vaccination and up to one year after completion of vaccinations, as required by study protocols. Samples will be processed as needed and transported to LMIV for immunological assay assessment. LMIV shall provide experimental vaccine products that have been tested for purity and lack of contamination with adventitious agents and that meet safety standards set by the NIH, the Center for Biologics Evaluation &amp; Research, FDA, and the Clinical Research Review Committees. <br /><br />2. Conduct a challenge study. Vaccines intended to prevent malaria infection (pre-erythrocytic or liver stage vaccines) may require challenge with malaria parasites to determine protective efficacy (Phase 2a). Such a study will include approximately 20 participants. Participants will be vaccinated and followed up with safety and immunologic assessments as summarized above. After completion of vaccination, consenting participants will be challenged using infected mosquitoes and will be intensively followed for the following 21 days to monitor immune responses and treat malaria infection. Inpatient follow-up with will be required, or alternately, volunteers may be housed in a hotel with study staff on site 24 hours/day during the intensive follow up period. Proposals including collaborators or subcontractors (for example, for the challenge or infection portion of a Phase 2a vaccine study or experimental infection study) must address the team management plan under sub-factor C of the Technical Approach.</p>
<p>3. Conduct Experimental Infection Studies. Experimental Human Infection Studies are an invaluable tool to study human malaria pathogenesis and immunity, such as the recent observation that malaria exposure occurring during anti-malarial prophylaxis can induce a sustained high level of protective immunity. In Experimental Infection Studies, 10-15 participants/group would be exposed to infectious or attenuated sporozoites, or infectious or attenuated infected erythrocytes, possibly in conjunction with other measures such as causal or suppressive anti-malarial prophylaxis. Exposure will be through infected mosquitoes or direct injection. Sampling regimens would be tailored to the parasitologic, immunologic, or other scientific objectives of the particular study. Exposure to infectious parasites would take place at set times, as stipulated by the study protocol. The period of follow-up would vary according to the scientific objectives. As an example, participants might receive 3 monthly exposures to infectious sporozoites while receiving anti-malarial prophylaxis, and 2 months later after cessation of anti-malarials would be challenged again with infectious sporozoites; participants would be intensively followed for at least 21 days after challenge to monitor immune responses (both humoral and cellular) and to treat malaria infection, should it occur. An additional group of 5-10 participants would also be infected as controls. Inpatient follow up would be required or, alternatively, volunteers may be housed in a hotel with study staff on site 24 hours/day during the intensive follow up period.</p>
<p>4. Additional trials (including challenge and experimental infection studies) during the first contract year and in up to six subsequent years will be available to LMIV on an optional basis.</p>
<p>5. Collaborate with LMIV investigators to draft clinical protocols as required by the Project Officer (PO). Protocol objectives and overall design will be drafted by LMIV. Both parties will subsequently participate in drafting the final protocol, and with compiling data necessary for presentation and publication of results. The Contractor will be responsible for obtaining approval for each study/protocol from the Contractor's Institutional Review Board and will coordinate with NIAID staff for approval by the NIAID Institutional Review Board. Where investigational applications are required, the Contractor shall provide approved protocols to the Project Officer to be filed with the Center for Biologics Evaluation &amp; Research, FDA by NIAID as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application. In addition, the Contractor shall send results of clinical trials and protocol reviews to the NIAID Investigational New Drug Coordinator to allow fulfillment of regulatory requirements for annual review and adverse event reporting by FDA and the relevant IRBs.</p>
<p>6. The Contractor shall recruit and select normal adult subjects, i.e., those in good health, meeting the requirements specified by individual protocols. Vaccine trials are expected to enroll 30-60 subjects/protocol; challenge and experimental infection studies are expected to enroll 20-40 subjects/protocol.</p>
<p>7. The Contractor shall provide facilities for documented and secure storage of investigational vaccines and provide the staff and facilities (e.g. pharmacy) for point-of-injection formulation, where necessary. Typically, this will take place no more than 6 hours prior to injection and follow standard operating procedures developed by LMIV in consultation with the contractor. The contractor will ensure quality control and documentation of procedures in accordance with LMIV SOPs. Storage temperatures will be 2-8&ordm;C or -80 &ordm;C, depending on the vaccines being evaluated.</p>
<p>8. The contractor will be responsible for initial processing, temporary storage, and shipment of samples to the LMIV for evaluation of immunological outcomes (to include at a minimum serum or plasma for assessment antibody levels, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the assessment of cellular responses). In a typical trial of thirty volunteers, ten samples will be collected over an 18-month period per volunteer. These will be stored in multiple aliquots. The contractor will need to provide secure storage at in a monitored -70oC or lower, freezer with a documented inventory control for samples to be assayed by the contractor and will need to provide similar temporary storage and arrange for periodic shipment of samples to the LMIV. The contractor will provide facilities for separation, cryopreservation and storage of lymphocytes from whole blood prior to shipping to the LMIV. Fresh PBMCs may also need to be transported to LMIV, depending on the assays to be conducted. Apheresis may also be required to obtain large volume serum or plasma, or higher numbers of PBMCs, as per study protocols.</p>
<p>9. The Contractor shall develop and maintain a system of records and data management for each study undertaken. This system of records shall be in accordance with the Privacy Act and the Confidentiality of information clause, which are contained herein. All IND documentation shall be prepared in accordance with FDA and other regulatory requirements. The Contractor shall establish procedures for tracking recruitment, retention and follow-up of study volunteers; this information shall be reported in the progress reports submitted to the Project Officer. All informed consent documents for each protocol shall be co-developed with the Project Officer. The Contractor's files and records are subject to inspection by the Government and all data established and prepared for each protocol are Government property and publications will not be prepared or distributed without Government approval. The Contractor shall maintain up-to-date summaries of all clinical trials including clinical and laboratory data (e.g. on Excel spreadsheets) that can be transmitted electronically to the Project Officer at the Project Officer's request.</p>
<p>10. The Contractor shall provide follow-up of all volunteers enrolled in trials prior to the end of the seven-year contract. The Contractor shall, at the approval of the Contracting Officer, continue the clinical evaluation, collection, analysis, storage and shipment of samples, data collection and reporting on all volunteers enrolled during the seven - year contract period from the end of the contract period until the completion of the period specified in the protocol or until such tasks can be transferred to a new Offeror approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>11. Three months prior to the end of the seventh year of this contract, the Contractor shall provide for an orderly transition of data and materials, including stored volunteer specimens and government-supplied reagents, to a successor Contractor or to the government, subject to the Contracting Officer's approval, and shall deliver, if requested by the Government, by the completion date of the contract, the following items; original data, remaining Government-supplied reagents, volunteer specimens and any necessary information related thereto, and Government-owned equipment and property.</p>

<DESC><p>****************************<br />NOTE: Please carefully review the attached information sheet which contains submittal instructions.<br />****************************<br /><br />The United States (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), Product Acquisition and Deployment Directorate (PADD) is seeking information on neutron radiation detectors that do not use Helium-3 (3He) technology.<br /><br />It is the intent of this RFI to determine the feasibility of utilizing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), or COTS that will be released into the commercial sector in the near future, with alternative neutron radiation detectors to accurately and rapidly detect threat material. The threat material includes Nuclear Weapons, Improvised Nuclear Devices (IND), Special Nuclear Material (SNM), as well as the identification of non-threatening neutron emitting material such as moisture density gauges used in road construction. By detecting and interdicting threat material, illicit trafficking is stopped without impeding the flow of legitimate trade and commerce.</p>
<p>The supply of 3He is decreasing and therefore DNDO is seeking alternatives to 3He based neutron radiation detection systems. DHS seeks to evaluate existing neutron radiation detector systems updated with alternative technologies (detectors which utilize new materials and methods) for neutron detection in the near term. DNDO is also requesting information about neutron radiation detector technologies (i.e., prototypes) which do not employ 3He and can be integrated into backpack, handheld, and city vehicle mounted form factors as part of a near term test campaign.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP or Broad Area Announcement (BAA). Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission; other than acknowledgment of receipt - IF a request for an acknowledgement is requested by the submitter. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitations or agreements. If a solicitation is released, it will be via the Government wide Port of Entry (GPE) at (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor the website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC><br />Yoke Trim Switches<br />Sources Sought Notice
<p><br />This is not a request for proposals. This synopsis is for information, planning and market research purposes only. This is not a solicitation announcement and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. Small and disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to provide input.<br />BACKGROUND: <br />The U.S. Coast Guard Medium Range Surveillance Maritime Patrol Aircraft (HC-144A) is a transport and surveillance aircraft that is used to perform search and rescue, enforce laws and treaties including illegal drug interdiction, marine environmental protection, military readiness, and international ice patrol missions. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates Twelve (12) CASA HC-144A aircraft (36 projected) that utilize the Page Aerospace Control Wheels (Yokes) E530-01-001 (Pilot) and E530-02-001 (Co-Pilot). Each control wheel utilizes two switches which control the pitch and roll trim of the aircraft. These switches have had reliability issues and also do not provide adequate tactile feel during engagement.<br />SYNOPSIS:<br />USCG, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Elizabeth City, NC is seeking alternate sources that can provide either an off-the-shelf, or research and development solution for a form fit replacement of the following switches (there are four switches per aircraft - two on each yoke):<br />Roll Trim Switch P/N C530-01-056<br />Pitch Trim Switch P/N C210-06-001<br />For mounting/installation compatibility, the base/mounting of the replacement switch should physically match that of the commonly used S-Tec 3112 trim switch. The replacement switch should have a safeguard feature to prevent accidental switch activation, and should have a positive tactile feel which positively indicates when the switch contacts are made and broken.<br />For electrical compatibility, the replacement switch would ideally be three pole, double-throw. Contact ratings should be 7 Amp resistive, 4 Amp inductive (28VDC) with an operating temperature range of -40&ordm;C to 70&ordm;C and an altitude rating of 15,000 feet.<br />All companies that can provide the services are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company cage code, brochures, or any other information demonstrating that the services can be provided.<br />Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions. After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO). Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the USCG to award any contract. TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Responses must be received no later than OCT 21, 2011 at 1545 hours (3:45 PM EST). Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the USCG make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement (if, any) separately from the responses to this announcement. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation. Organizations having the required expertise and capabilities are invited to provide comments. The information contained here shall pertain to this sources sought and shall not be construed as a solicitation for painting the Coast Guard's HC144 aircraft. The Coast Guard does not intend to pay for the information received.</p>
<p>REPLIES:<br />All interested parties should respond in writing to Bryan Bray, MRS Product Line, Engineering Division, c/o Commanding Officer, USCG Aircraft Logistic Center, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, phone: (252) 384-7290 e-mail address: bryan.p.bray@uscg.mil or to Wade Johnson, MRS Contracting Officer, e-mail address; wade.johnson@uscg.mil.</p>

<DESC>2D Tomography System: <br />The solicitation number is FA8601-11-T-0129. The NAICS Code is 334517. The size standard is 500 employees. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). This synopsis is for informational purposes only. The proposed source is Spectral Energies, LLC; Dayton, Ohio 45431. The requirement specifications are as follows:
<p>The requested system includes the construction of a 2D grid system for tomographic reconstruction of the flow field of a combustor using 18 diode laser sensors. The sensor system will make temperature and H2O concentration measurements at 81 grid points. A tomographic reconstruction software will be provided. The 2-D grid system will be constructed by arranging the 18 Time Division Multiplexor sensors covering the flow field. The measurements will be performed at a rate of 30 kHz so temporal evolution of the 2-D temperature-field can be captured on a real-time basis. This hyper spectral sensor system along with the tomographic reconstruction model will allow capturing the dominant spatial and temporal instability modes in the combustors along with their interaction and spatio-temporal evolution providing both a research capability as well as a real-time diagnostic for deployed systems. The vendor is responsible for shipment, installation and calibration of one unit to AFIT/ENY (Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio).</p>

<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Participants are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds. It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. The information requested will be used by the Air Force to facilitate decision making for potential future acquisitions. Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website for future information pertaining to this potential requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Air Force Civil Engineering Commodity Council (AFCECC) is seeking information on commercial roofing services in support of Air Force installations throughout the United States.</p>
<p>The AFCECC is part of the Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH. The mission of the ESG is to provide the U.S. Air Force cross-functional installation strategic sourcing and acquisition solutions. The ESG is the Air Force's centralized organization for executing enterprise-wide strategic sourcing of goods and services for Air Force installations throughout the United States. They utilize strategic sourcing best practices to continually improve and re-evaluate organizational purchasing activities, to improve quality, and reduce costs for installation acquisition. The ESG uses cross-functional teams called "Commodity Councils" to strategically source goods and/or services at the enterprise level.</p>
<p>We are conducting market research into the commercial roofing industry to better understand the capabilities of the supply base and obtain feedback on our projected commercial roofing needs. The initial scope of this research includes services for roof replacement, maintenance, repair, and inspection. The service includes labor, tools and equipment necessary to repair, replace, inspect, and maintain the roofs on facilities at approximately 66 Air Force Installations. All CONUS facilities (including Medical facilities) are in scope, to include Hawaii and Alaska.</p>
<p>Currently, these services are typically procured, when needed, by each facility using a local base contracting office. The AFCECC seeks to develop a long term strategic sourcing contract vehicle to satisfy demand so facilities may place orders as needs arise. By leveraging resources, defining common requirements and specifications, we will simplify the acquisition process and reduce the lead time in the ordering process for the requesting location. There has not been any final determination concerning the number, scope and geographic coverage of requirements associated with this area of interest.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>The AFCECC seeks to learn from industry the unique aspects or procedures for commercial roofing throughout the United States. As the AFCECC is analyzing the feasibility for an Air Force wide acquisition solution, preliminary research suggests that the scope might stretch the capabilities of small business. However, we seek both large and small business respondents who are interested in supporting the Air Force's needs. The input received will help us ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offerors. Reviews of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes/spend (3 year average annual receipts) suggests 238160 - Roofing Contractors - with a small business size standard of $14M may be most applicable for this effort.</p>
<p>If you are an interested large or small business, please complete the short questionnaire at <a href="http://www.mcix.com/questionnaire">http://www.mcix.com/questionnaire</a>.&nbsp; This will include providing the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative that the Government may contact for additional information. We highly encourage all interested parties to provide a complete and thorough questionnaire in response to this RFI, however not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released. Notice: The Air Force has non-government employees (i.e. contractor employees) assisting with its market research. These non-government employees, all of whom have signed nondisclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.</p>
<p>The above link will direct you to the online questionnaire. For your convenience, there is a PDF document that has all the questions so you and your company can review prior to starting the online questionnaire. You will need to have information such as your company's DUNs number, CAGE code (if available), basic employee data, revenue data, etc. for the past 3 fiscal tax years (or as best approximated). The PDF document is for reference only. The online questionnaire will be the source tool for gathering responses, please use the best available information or estimates. If you need to stop the survey during any time, you will be able to resume your session using the same computer from which you started.</p>
<p>Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the AFCECC requirements. Individual capability briefs will not be accepted at this time. Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov">www.fedbizopps.gov</a> &nbsp;for future announcements regarding future needs. It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates. The Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website can send automatic alerts when a notice is posted meeting established criteria. To subscribe to this service, vendors should establish a "search agent" within their registered account. Search agents can be established for any combination of criteria, be set to run at your desired frequency and will notify you of relevant opportunities. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the FBO site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.</p>
<p>4.0 Industry Discussions</p>
<p>ESG CECC representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to support Air Force market research by obtaining further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>5.0 Responses/Questions</p>
<p>Please complete the questionnaire no later than 19 October 2011. Questions on this RFI may also be directed to these POCs via email through 17 October 2011.</p>
<p>Ms. Nanci Pigeon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Christopher Hoff<br />Contracting Specialist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program Manager<br />771 ESS/EGA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;771 ESS/EGA<br /><a href="mailto:nanci.pigeon@wpafb.af.mil">nanci.pigeon@wpafb.af.mil</a>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:christopher.hoff@wpafb.af.mil">christopher.hoff@wpafb.af.mil</a></p>
<p>6.0 Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. It is intended to identify sources that can provide information around capabilities for providing commercial roofing needs.</p>
<p>The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. The Air Force has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<CONTACT>Terricka D. Leonard, 251-441-6500

<a href="mailto:terricka.d.leonard@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of sole source intent by the US Army Corps of Engineers Mobile District, to modify contract no. W91278-08-C-0021 with Hensel Phelps Construction Co. to provide facilities operations and maintenance services for the US Southern Command Headquarters and supporting facilities in Miami-Doral, FL for a period of 3-months, from 01 Nov 2011 through 31 Jan 2011.  This proposed contract modification is an out of scope modification to Hensel Phelps contract that was awarded in Apr 2008 and substantially completed 29 Oct 2010.  This is the third such modification for the same services; the original modification was for the period November through 31 May 2011, followed by a subsequent modification for the period 01 Jun through 31 Oct 2011. It remains the Government's intent to provide for essential facilities operations and maintenance services while the existing Army public works activity expands its capacities and completes a solicitation for a more comprehensive facilities operations and maintenance contract currently advertised under W911SF-11-R-0028 by the US Army Mission and Installation Contracting Command, Fort Benning, Georgia. Federal budgetary and hiring limitations through Fiscal Year 2011 delayed the expansion of the Army's Public Work capacities and delayed the development of this solicitation, however final award of this new Contract is expected in late November 2011 with a transition and phase-in period occurring through not later than 31 Jan 2012. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all information received within fifteen days after publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.<br><br>The modification would include firm fixed price for facilities operations, maintenance, and emergency repair/response services for all US Southern Command and US Army Garrison Miami real property facilities, components and systems, and selected improved grounds maintenance ( roads, parking, storm water retention, utilities, security fencing and related equipment ). It may include a limited capacity to estimate scope/cost, design, and perform minor maintenance and repair projects no longer covered by new construction warranties and/or minor alteration projects to meet new operational requirements.  It will not include landscape maintenance, custodial services, or utilities services.  The facilities complex supported by this modification is a new $400-million campus style complex, substantially completed on 29 Oct 2010, that includes three complex, state-of-the-art multi-purpose and command and control facilities, to included small retail sales and food court facility, totaling over 645,000 square feet, all supporting roads, parking, drainage, storm water retention, utilities, back-up power and other supporting infrastructure.  The complex is located on a government secured 55-acre site in Miami-Doral, FL and supports over 2,400 government employees and contractors that make up Headquarters, US Southern Command (one of six regional US Combatant Commands critical to national security) responsible for command and control of US military operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as US Army Garrison Miami, and a diverse array of other supporting tenants and activities.  The site will be secured and require appropriate government background checks and identification for access; with some areas requiring a Secret security clearance and/or escorted access.  The national significance of this site and of the functions it supports requires a unique and significantly high degree of response, urgency, and expertise.<br><br>US Army Garrison - Miami is the current public works activity is only staffed to coordinate basic building management services for 250,000 square feet of leased facilities through full service leases; and expanding those capacities was delayed through much of 2011 due to ongoing budget and hiring constraints. The organization is only now beginning to develop the capacity to provide the extensive technical information, training and other assistance required to solicit, award and supervise start-up of a comprehensive facilities operations and maintenance contract.  As such, developing, executing and starting a comprehensive competitive solicitation for these services, with a contractor that may not be inherently familiar with these complex facilities, took longer than previously anticipated.<br><br>The detailed facilities technical specifications and data for these complex new facilities were not made available and turned over to the Government until almost six months after beneficial occupancy and substantial completion.  As such, combined with the Army's limited public works capacities and required contract solicitation timeline, the Government was unable to solicit and award a competitive contract for these services any earlier than late Nov 2011.<br><br>Hensel Phelps, as the prime contractor who designed and constructed these complex facilities, and has been performing facility operations and maintenance services, to include warranty management, for the past 11-months, is intimately familiar with the facilities and has the unique knowledge and expertise to provide effective and efficient facilities operations and maintenance services and effectively transition these functions to a new contractor once an award in made in late Nov 2011, providing technical assistance and training during transition that is currently beyond the Governments capacity to provide.<br><br>Future Acquisition Strategy & Contracting Opportunities.  The Government is currently soliciting for comprehensive facilities operations and maintenance service for this requirement through an 8A competitive solicitation (W911SF-11-R-0028) being handled by the Fort Benning, Georgia Mission and Installation Contracting Command office.  The Army anticipates awarding this contract in late Nov 2011, with transition between the current provider to occur Dec 2011 through Jan 2012, with full performance by the end of Jan 2012.  This solicitation is for a performance period Dec 2011 to Nov 2012 with four (4) additional option years.<br><br>This announcement is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Other Than Full & Open Competition. This notice is not a request for offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Firms interested in being considered shall provide information regarding their capabilities and experience to perform the requirements as well as past performance of similar work, to include project location and names and telephone numbers of customer points of contact.  Experience shall include facilities operations and maintenance on comparable facilities of comparable size and complexity, as well as experience with other US Army or DoD organizations/installations facilities operations and maintenance systems.<br><br>Written notification and supporting documentation regarding this action may be submitted in writing to: US Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN: CESAM-CT-C (Shirley West), P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628-0001 or Shirley.a.west@usace.army.mil.  Responses must be received within 15 calendar days of publication of this synopsis. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided. A solicitation is not available.

<DESC><p>1. This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This RFI is issued for information purposes only and neither constitutes a solicitation nor a commitment by the Government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary, and participants will not receive consideration. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this special notice or to otherwise pay for the information. Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>2. The Special Operation Research, Development, and Acquisition Center Program Executive Officer for Fixed Wing Programs is soliciting information to identify possible sources and costs for the design, integration, and installation of a Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM) system into the MC-130J.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should assume no United States Government (USG) provided data for MC-130J and variants. Responses should identify the data necessary for system development and integration. Responses should define how said data will be obtained; if teaming arrangements are used to meet data needs, the RFI response should identify potential teaming arrangements and roles and responsibilities. <br /><br />3. The USG has particular interest in production ready systems (i.e., minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 as defined by the Department of Defense (DOD) Acquisition Guidebook (August 5, 2010) and a minimum Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of 7 as defined by the DOD Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Deskbook (May 2, 2009). The RFCM Systems and/or components not currently meeting a TRL 7 and a MRL 7 should include a description of the maturation activities and overall schedule, and cost required to support the objectives in Paragraph 5 of this RFI. Potential solutions should include internally and externally (wing/under-wing mounted) systems.</p>
<p>4. USSOCOM is looking for a new Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM) system for MC-130J aircraft to permit safe execution of aerial refueling of SOF vertical lift aircraft; low-level, clandestine infiltration/exfiltration and resupply of special operations teams; armed over-watch; precision identification/targeting of hostile forces; collection of non-traditional signals of interest; and other missions as directed. Respondents to this RFI should describe their capability (i.e., hardware, software, open system architecture, integration experience, etc) to meet and/or exceed the following objectives:</p>
<p>a. The RFCM system shall detect, identify, provide geolocated threat position data to an existing situational awareness system and display, and determine and implement the appropriate response to eliminate the threat system's lethality or degrade it to the extent necessary to allow the aircraft to escape the engagement envelope.</p>
<p>b. The RFCM system shall determine the optimum response based on the total battlespace.</p>
<p>c. The RFCM system shall be adaptable and reprogrammable by existing government organizations and processes to accommodate the changing threat environment.</p>
<p>d. The RFCM system shall include frequency jamming capabilities to engage multiple threats at different aspect angles simultaneously across the RF frequency range. The focus of the system is aircraft self protection.</p>
<p>e. Provide non-traditional data and signals of interest (NTDSOI) receiver capability within its frequency range for threat detection and target cueing.</p>
<p>f. The RFCM system's capability to provide additional threat awareness functions, such as electronic surveillance measures (ESM) and radar warning receiver (RWR), from the RFCM system should also be addressed.</p>
<p>5. In particular, the Government is interested in the following information:</p>
<p>a. The capability your system can provide. Provide a technical description of the solution to include details of the airframe, subsystems, open systems architecture, future growth capability, modular and scalable aspects consistent with capability, and the associated schedule and cost. Also discuss reliability, maintenance concept (e.g., 2 or 3 level), and manpower requirements.</p>
<p>b. Responses should address any safety concerns/considerations and integration challenges associated with integration of the proposed RFCM system with the aircraft's existing systems, and anticipated aircrew workload impact.</p>
<p>c. A notional funding profile (rough order of magnitude) for your proposed solution with break outs for RDT&amp;E and procurement. Identify the level of engineering design, integration, software development, developmental test and evaluation (DT&amp;E) required and initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) required. Discuss the notional schedule and cost for the development/integration effort.</p>
<p>d. Your relevant experience with recent C-130 aircraft modification, software development, and integration efforts. Highlight any RFCM development and integration experience (to include associated aircrew training solutions) that is pertinent. Supporting exhibits such as drawings, concepts, schedule, and cost may also be included in the response.</p>
<p>e. How modifications would/could be accomplished--production line incorporation or as post-production modifications. Address any capabilities not available at initial operational capability (IOC) and how they will be provided post-IOC. For out-years, identify any funding that may be required. The IOC is defined as having 3 modified aircraft plus one spare and all sustainment and training requirements in place.</p>
<p>f. The process used for airworthiness certification of your proposed solution.</p>
<p>g. Provide a notional schedule clearly showing contract award, long lead procurement, production milestones, training/training system events, technical order development, contractor test and evaluation, USAF DT&amp;E and IOT&amp;E, and logistics/sustainment events with assets available and IOC.</p>
<p>6. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS. Responses to this RFI shall be limited to 50 pages in length, not including the cover page or exhibits (including pictures within the text). Classified information must be handled, labeled, and stored in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) Operating Manual. Responses should be e-mailed to the POCs listed below. Paper copies of the paper submittal will also be accepted If the response contains proprietary/competition sensitive material, paper copies must be clearly labeled "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Material". Proprietary/competition sensitive material will be protected from disclosure. When appropriate, non-Government advisors may be used to objectively review a particular functional area and provide comments and recommendations to the Government. All advisors shall comply with Procurement Integrity Laws and shall sign non-disclosure and rules of conduct/conflict of interest statements. The Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding conflicts of interest and ensure advisors comply with safeguarding proprietary data. Submission in response to this RFI constitutes approval to release the submittal to Government support contractors.<br /><br />7. Your response must be received no later than 15 calendar days after RFI release.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source Contract Award

The Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a 6-month sole source contract award with Molecular Imaging of Hinsdale, IL to provide PET/CT Services for the Hines VA Hospital under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy.

Technical Scope:  Contractor to provide FDA Approved Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) Scan Services for beneficiaries of the Hines VA.  Contractor will provide labor, materials, supplies, equipment, certified personnel, and radioactive tracers and incidentals required to perform the scans.  Contractor shall provide overall supervision of exams.  

Contractor Equipment:  Contractor shall maintain its positron emission tomography equipment (PET/CT) in good working order and in accordance with the specifications of the manufacturer.  Equipment quality control shall be performed in accordance with manufacturer's specifications.  Records of equipment quality control activities shall be made available to VA for review upon request.  The PET/CT scanner must have appropriate certification and have routine maintenance and quality assurance reviews.  Evidence of this must be included in the Contractors proposal.

Personnel: Contractor shall provide all required (at least 2 fte/service day) specialized medical PET/CT Technologists per service day and any qualified support staff (as patient volume requires) necessary to provide services for the VA patients. It is anticipated that equipment and staff will be required a minimum of an eight (8) hour day.  

POP: October 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012

Based on market research, Molecular Imaging is the only source that can satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement is only required for an additional 6-months and will not be needed because of the construction of a mobile pad.  At that time a new contract will be established for Mobile PET/CT Services.  An interim contract needs to be established to prevent a break in service to the Veterans.  A decision to not compete was made because establishing a new contract for this interim period would have a negative impact and costs (new scheduling requirements, advertising new location, reviewing existing equipment, establishing a method for transmitting records) that could not be covered through competition.  

Regarding personnel, Molecular Imaging already possesses the required security background checks needed to perform the services immediately. With the current backlog in NACI Background checks another provider would probably not be able to perform services for several months, even, assuming, they could provide the equipment. 

Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by October 12, 2011. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement by October 12, 2011; these will be evaluated by the government. A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation documents are available and no telephone request will be honored.

<p>The Government will award a contract, pending availability of funds, resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. We are using the lowest price technically acceptable method of source selection. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY<br />(2) PRICE</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability and Price, when combined, are EQUAL. However, quotes which are not rated as Technically Acceptable will be eliminated from the competition and receive no further consideration.</p>
<p>(1) All proposals timely received will be evaluated and an award, pending availability of funds, will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsible offeror who responds to all items included in the solicitation (all or none) and complies with the terms of the Request for Quote (RFQ).<br />(2) These are the technical areas that we will evaluate to determine the technical acceptability:<br />a. Reasonableness of proposed schedule. The Air Force estimates a period of performance between 6 and 8 months from Notice to Proceed.<br />b. Company's three year history of similar projects, including whether any Notices of Violation were received. Receipt of any Notice of Violations will not alone disqualify quotes.<br />c. Demonstration of the company's capabilities to manage and perform multiple (2-3) ongoing projects.<br />d. Submittal of a valid Bondability Letter from a Department of Treasury approved Bonding Agency covering the total offered price.<br />(3) The offers will be evaluated by key government personnel, who are expert in their respective disciplines, rating the aforementioned technical areas on a pass or fail basis.

<p>Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference<br />52.252-5 Authorized Deviations in Provisions<br />252.209-7001 Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country<br />252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items<br />252.228-7004 Bonds or Other Security<br />Section H: Special Contract Requirements</p>

If this information is found to be false or inaccurate, the quote may be determined to be ineligible and not considered for award.</p>
<p><br />All potential offerors are reminded that compliance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARs) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), is mandatory. Lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.

BACKGROUND: 1 BCT is responsible for training and deploying Soldiers in support of a contingency operation, Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Mission success will rely on our leaders' abilities to interact effectively with prominent local leaders, public servants, and political figures in the Counter-Insurgency arena. Dari Language Cultural Advisors will afford 1 BCT leadership the opportunity to experience optimized training through tough and realistic scenarios focused on Counter-Insurgency Operations.<br><br>a.	Specifically, the Government requests that the contractor provides individuals that will act as Dari Language Speakers, Cultural Advisors, Civilians on the Battlefield, Interpreters, and support to Opposition Force on Situational Training Exercise (STX) lanes for Soldiers deploying for a contingency operation into theater from Fort Bragg, NC.<br><br>b.	Cultural Advisors, Dari Language Speakers, and Interpreters provide an essential training experience to Soldiers preparing for combat in varying conditions. Conditions may vary from coordinating an opportunity to meet with local leaders to occupying a vehicle or personnel entry control point, interfacing with an indigenous informant or walk-in, communicating properly with local political, police or religious leaders to develop situational awareness and atmospherics, or directing both combatants and non-combatants during offensive operations.<br><br>c.	Dari Language Speakers enable newly trained Soldiers to apply language skills in a tactical environment, and Interpreters provide leaders an opportunity to negotiate interpreter based challenges in training.<br><br><br>3.

<DESC>You may have heard of a "Miracle on 34th Street" and "White Christmas" but if you haven't heard how the Air Forces' "Tops In Blue Holiday Tour" touches the hearts of US troops downrange, please follow along.<br />The Tops In Blue team itself is comprised of active duty men and women who perform around the world fulfilling a mission to increase troop morale, benefit recruiting efforts and promote community relationships. <br />Each holiday season, the team heads to Southwest Asia to lift the spirits of over 3,500 Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines serving in the combat zone. In just ten days, Tops In Blue will perform nine shows in Afghanistan, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Kyrgyzstan.<br />It's hard to find the holiday spirit in a war zone but with familiar carols and a VIP all dressed in red, the Tops In Blue Holiday Tour performance turns folks from 18 to 60 into believers. The audience drags in toting guns and dressed in body armor but a lively rendition of "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" has them humming along and tapping their feet. <br />But the real magic comes when Tops In Blue sings, "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" and the jolly old elf himself appears with a bag full of surprises for these defenders of freedom.<br />To continue the tradition, we're reaching out to a sponsor or sponsors to provide items for "Santa's sack" to bring some magic to our troops this holiday season. Sponsors will be announced at each performance and the gift provided will undoubtedly make an impression on these men and women that just might last a lifetime. <br />Details are as follows:<br />Acceptable items will not be perishable or larger than a bread box. 60 - 90 items are sought per performance. All items must arrive at the following address by 15 Nov: 3515 S. General McMullen, Bldg 171, San Antonio, TX 78226. <br />This is a solicitation for sponsors by a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States Government. It does not oblige appropriated funds of the government. Interested companies should contact HQ Air Force Services Agency Marketing Department, Rita Shrewsbury at 210-395-7241 or <a href="mailto:rita.shrewsbury@us.af.mil">rita.shrewsbury@us.af.mil</a>.&nbsp; More information is available at www.reachtheairforce.com<br /><br />

Below is general information about the requirement, <strong>1) Nature of Survey.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>Audience data shall be obtained through a survey of Libya that is designed to obtain the most accurate possible information about: (a) the size of the audience for BBG&rsquo;s Arabic language TV channel, Alhurra, and the Arabic language radio channel, Radio Sawa; (b)<span>&nbsp; </span>the size of the regular and occasional audience for other international and domestic television and radio broadcasters (c) demographic characteristics and geographical distribution of these audiences; and (d) general patterns of media use.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, a small number of questions concerning respondents&rsquo; views on various social and political questions may be included in the survey. The interviews shall be conducted by telephone by trained interviewers using CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing) methodology.<span>&nbsp; </span>IBB will require demographic information on each respondent including, gender, age, and education.<span>&nbsp; </span><strong>2) General Responsibilities of Contractor.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall be responsible for the project design and execution, including the following specific tasks: A. Translation, formatting, pretesting, and adaptation of the questionnaire for CATI administration; B. Development of Sampling Plan, based on consultation with IBB, Office of Research; C. Training interviewers; D. Arranging and supervising all aspects of fieldwork; E. Entering and processing the survey data, including data cleaning and encoding survey responses and F. Ascertaining the representativeness of the sample and weighting the data, if necessary; <strong>3) Sample Design.</strong> Interested offerors are requested to submit price quotations for a total sample of 500 and 1,000 adults,<span>&nbsp; </span>age 15 or older, that is representative to the maximum extent possible of the population of the survey universe. While a national survey covering all telephone households would be desirable, BBG recognizes that logistical and other constraints may affect the extent to which all portions of the Libyan population may be covered in a sample survey, as well as the sampling methods that may be employed. Offerors are therefore encouraged to submit proposals offering various levels of survey coverage, with accompanying pricing for each.<span>&nbsp; </span>Proposals should include a precise definition of the population(s) to be covered, including estimates of the size of that population and a description of the sampling frame(s) to be used.<span>&nbsp; </span>Given the assumed prevalence of mobile phones in Libya, it would be highly desirable to include mobile phone lines in the sample frame in addition to land lines.<span>&nbsp; </span>Offerors&rsquo; sampling plans should, if possible, include provision for inclusion of mobile phone users in the study.<span>&nbsp; </span>If offerors believe it is not possible to include mobile phone users, proposals should clearly state this and the reasons for their exclusion.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The sample shall be drawn using recognized probability methods, all the way down to the selection of the individual respondent at the household level.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the event that any departure from probability sampling methods is recommended by the offeror for all or any part of the survey, the sampling methodologies to be employed shall be described in detail and a rationale for their use shall be provided.<span>&nbsp; </span>A detailed sampling plan shall be submitted including a description of the survey coverage, allocation of the sample, description of the sampling frame, description of any stratification criteria to be used, description of the stages of selection and the selections methods to be used at each stage, the method to be used for selection of the respondent at the household level, and call-back rules to be employed. It is assumed that the sample will be distributed in proportion to the population of each region or other geographic unit to be surveyed; in the event that the offeror wishes to propose a sample design departing from this principle the proposal should describe the allocation to be used and the reasons for doing so. <strong>4) Questionnaire.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>IBB will supply a set of questions for an interview of approximately 15 minutes. Questionnaire will be provided in draft form for suggestions and comments by contractor based on contractor&rsquo;s knowledge of local cultural or political sensitivities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Following receipt of contractor&rsquo;s comments, IBB shall prepare a final English version of the questionnaire that the contractor shall translate into Arabic.<span>&nbsp; </span><strong>5) Pre-test.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>The questionnaire shall be pre-tested by the contractor prior to the commencement of any fieldwork</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">with at least 15 pre-test interviews conducted.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall provide IBB with a written report of the results of the pre-test, along with details of any problems encountered and suggested remedies, prior to the commencement of any fieldwork. <strong>6) Fieldwork.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>Interviews shall be conducted by experienced field workers who shall be thoroughly briefed by contractor prior to commencement of any fieldwork.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall ensure that interviewers are thoroughly familiar with household and respondent selection procedures, call back procedures, and the structure of the questionnaire, including routing and filtering.<span>&nbsp; </span>Interviewer training shall include practice sessions in administering the questionnaire.<span>&nbsp; </span>A minimum of 10% of interviews shall be back checked and 5% of the interviews shall be accompanied by a team supervisor. The offerors response to the RFP shall include a description of the professional qualifications of the proposed interviewers and a description of the training that shall be provided to interviewers to ensure proper understanding of the survey instrument. <strong>7) Data Processing.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall be responsible for data entry, cleaning, and processing, including development and implementation of a coding scheme for all open-ended questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall supply data to IBB as a clean, fully labeled SPSS &ldquo;*.sav&rdquo; file with a complete data dictionary of variable names and value labels.<span>&nbsp; </span>There shall be one data record for each respondent and records shall be of fixed length.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall be responsible for deriving and applying any post-stratification weights required to bring the sample into conformity with the demographic profile of the population, as well as any additional weighting factors required to correct for disproportionate allocation, if use. Each record shall include a unique respondent ID number, interviewer ID number, PSU ID number, and codes for precise location and date of interview.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each record shall include demographic information about the respondent, including: gender, exact age, and education level. <strong>8) Technical Appendix.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>When delivering data, the contractor shall provide a Technical Appendix which shall include the following: </span></p>

<DESC>The Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) role for UAVs is dependent upon the ability of the UAV to do its mission without the adversary being able to counter it.  For many such ISR applications, the acoustic signature of the UAV alerts the adversary to the UAV's presence and can interfere with the mission.  Battery powered UAVs are very quiet but lack endurance and payload capability.  Better, more efficient, quiet power sources and propulsion techniques are needed to engineer the next generation UAVs for ISR mission applications.<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Great Horned Owl (GHO) Program seeks to develop technologies that significantly extend the operational endurance and payload capabilities of ISR UAVs.  The anticipated innovation in this first phase of the program is a propulsion system that will quietly generate electrical power from liquid hydrocarbon fuel (specifically gasoline or diesel) and enable purely electrically driven quiet flight.  The specific propulsion subsystems that this BAA is interested in funding are (1) fuel-to-electricity devices using an advanced combustion engine directly coupled to alternator/generator concepts and (2) electricity-to-thrust devices utilizing innovative electric motor driven propulsor systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />This BAA is soliciting proposals for Phase 1 only, which will last 15 months.</p>

<p>1 each part number 653119, C6 flow cytometer, CFlow Plus Software, Workstation, CSampler and CFlow Sampler Software</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specifications</span>:</p>
<p>1) A small footprint of 11.0"H x 14.75"W x 16.5"D (27.9 x 37.4 x 41.9 cm) (11"H x 21.5"W x 16.5"D with fluid bottles) and weight under 35 lbs, which permits easy placement of the C6 on the lab bench, in a fume hood or a glove box. <br /><br />2) Ease of routine maintenance. <br /><br />3) Offeror must provide a loaner instument if the instrument&nbsp;needs repaired.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />4) The sheath fluid recommended for the C6 is filtered, deionized laboratory grade water. <br /><br />5) Many sample tube types can be used including 12 x 75 mm tubes, and various microcentrifuge tubes. Microcentrifuge tubes can be used for sample volumes as low as 50ul.<br /><br />6) Absolute cell counts can be obtained with the C6 without the need to add counting beads, providing cell concentration without additional testing equipment or reagents. <br /><br />7) A 24-bit digital signal processor generates data over a range of 7.2 decades or 16,777,215 channels and the zoom function allows focusing on populations of interest, eliminating the need to make voltage adjustments to the detectors which, in turn, allows for easier data collection as well as no wasted samples when setting up new applications. The wide dynamic range of the C6 allows both dim and bright signals to be displayed on the same scale. <br /><br />8) Allows lower powered laser to be used: <br />14.7 mW 640nm Diode Red laser <br />20 mW 488 nm solid state blue laser <br /><br />9) Must be capable of acquiring data at event rates up to 10,000 events/sec. <br /><br />10) A wider range of flow rates, continuously variable from 10-100ul and core sizes variable from 5-40um allow for increased resolution and speed in data collection. <br /><br />11) No air-over-fluid pressure is required to create the hydrodynamic focusing of the sheath; therefore no aerosols are generated. <br /><br />12) A simple, quick exchange of filters is all that is required to detect additional fluorochromes. Accuri offers several optional optical and user swappable filters: 510nm, 540nm, 565nm, 610nm, 630nm, and 780nm, as well as attenuation filters, that can be substituted for the standard filters supplied with the C6. <br /><br />13) Cflow plus analysis software can be used for data analysis on both a PC or on a Mac. Sample data can also be exported to third party software including, FlowJo, FCS Express, WinList, etc. <br /><br />14) The optional selectable laser module can be purchased at any time and allows the choice of using three lasers configurations: 1) three detectors off the blue laser and one detector off the red laser 2) two detectors off the blue laser and 2 detectors off the red laser and 3) four detectors off the blue laser. <br /><br />15) The catalog numbers listed are from BD Biosciences. <br /><br />16) Offerors are requested to quote on the items as specified or an equivalent. For an equivalent, complete specifications and/or descriptive literature will be provided with the response. Offerors are requested to indicate any differences from the specifications listed.

Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br><br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.<br><br>(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--<br><br>(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or<br><br>(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).<br><br>(b) Contractor's EFT information.

If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. <br><br>(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--<br><br>(i) Making a correct payment;<br><br>(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and<br><br>(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.<br><br>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--<br><br>(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or<br>(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.<br><br>(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.<br><br>(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause.

In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.<br><br>(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.<br><br>(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.<br><br>(End of Clause)<br>

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM or AFISRA ombudsmen, AFSPC/A7K, 150 Vandenberg Street, Peterson AFB CO 80914, (P) 719- 554-5250, (F) 719-554-5299, A7K.wf@peterson.af.mil.

Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>The Government will award a contract, pending availability of funds, resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. We are using the lowest price technically acceptable method of source selection. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY<br />(2) PRICE</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability and Price, when combined, are EQUAL. However, quotes which are not rated as Technically Acceptable will be eliminated from the competition and receive no further consideration.</p>
<p>(1) All proposals timely received will be evaluated and an award, pending availability of funds, will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsible offeror who responds to all items included in the solicitation (all or none) and complies with the terms of the Request for Quote (RFQ).<br />(2) These are the technical areas that we will evaluate to determine the technical acceptability:<br />a. Reasonableness of proposed schedule. The Air Force estimates a period of performance between 6 and 8 months from Notice to Proceed.<br />b. Company's three year history of similar projects, including whether any Notices of Violation were received. Receipt of any Notice of Violations will not alone disqualify quotes.<br />c. Demonstration of the company's capabilities to manage and perform multiple (2-3) ongoing projects.<br />d. Submittal of a valid Bondability Letter from a Department of Treasury approved Bonding Agency covering the total offered price.<br />(3) The offers will be evaluated by key government personnel, who are expert in their respective disciplines, rating the aforementioned technical areas on a pass or fail basis. Any offer receiving a "fail" rating on any of the technical areas will be ineligible and not considered for contract award.</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, Alternate I<br />Offerors must be registered on ORCA (https://orca.bpn.gov /)<br />52.219-1 Small Business Program Representation, Alternate I<br />52.222-22 Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports<br />52.222-25 Affirmative Action Compliance<br />52.225-25 Prohibition on Engaging in Sanctioned Activities Relating to Iran-Certification<br />52.233-2 Service of Protest<br />52.237-1 Site Visit</p>
<p>Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference<br />52.252-5 Authorized Deviations in Provisions<br />252.209-7001 Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country<br />252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items<br />252.228-7004 Bonds or Other Security<br />Section H: Special Contract Requirements</p>
<p>By submitting this quote the Offeror is admitting that to the best of their knowledge their company has received _________ Notices of Violations within the past three years. If this information is found to be false or inaccurate, the quote may be determined to be ineligible and not considered for award.</p>
<p><br />All potential offerors are reminded that compliance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARs) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), is mandatory. Lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. All quotes should be valid for ninety (90) days and must be sent to Megan Ashley at megan.ashley@vandenberg.af.mil <strong>and</strong> Sean Kennedy at sean.kennedy@vandenberg.af.mil or faxed to 805-606-5867 no later than <strong>3:00 PM PDT on&nbsp;30 August 2011. </strong></p>

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM or AFISRA ombudsmen, AFSPC/A7K, 150 Vandenberg Street, Peterson AFB CO 80914, (P) 719- 554-5250, (F) 719-554-5299, A7K.wf@peterson.af.mil.

Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>The Government will award a contract, pending availability of funds, resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. We are using the lowest price technically acceptable method of source selection. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY<br />(2) PRICE</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability and Price, when combined, are EQUAL. However, quotes which are not rated as Technically Acceptable will be eliminated from the competition and receive no further consideration.</p>
<p>(1) All proposals timely received will be evaluated and an award, pending availability of funds, will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsible offeror who responds to all items included in the solicitation (all or none) and complies with the terms of the Request for Quote (RFQ).<br />(2) These are the technical areas that we will evaluate to determine the technical acceptability:<br />a. Reasonableness of proposed schedule. The Air Force estimates a period of performance between 8 and 11 months from Notice to Proceed.<br />b. Company's three year history of similar projects, including whether any Notices of Violation were received. Receipt of any Notice of Violations will not alone disqualify quotes.<br />c. Demonstration of the company's capabilities to manage and perform multiple (5-7) ongoing projects.<br />d. Submittal of a valid Bondability Letter from a Department of Treasury approved Bonding Agency covering the total offered price.<br />(3) The offers will be evaluated by key government personnel, who are expert in their respective disciplines, rating the aforementioned technical areas on a pass or fail basis. Any offer receiving a "fail" rating on any of the technical areas will be ineligible and not considered for contract award.</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, Alternate I<br />Offerors must be registered on ORCA (https://orca.bpn.gov /)<br />52.219-1 Small Business Program Representation, Alternate I<br />52.222-22 Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports<br />52.222-25 Affirmative Action Compliance<br />52.225-25 Prohibition on Engaging in Sanctioned Activities Relating to Iran-Certification<br />52.233-2 Service of Protest<br />52.237-1 Site Visit</p>
<p>Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference<br />52.252-5 Authorized Deviations in Provisions<br />252.209-7001 Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country<br />252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items<br />252.228-7004 Bonds or Other Security<br />Section H: Special Contract Requirements</p>
<p>By submitting this quote the Offeror is admitting that to the best of their knowledge their company has received _________ Notices of Violations within the past three years. If this information is found to be false or inaccurate, the quote may be determined to be ineligible and not considered for award.</p>
<p><br />All potential offerors are reminded that compliance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARs) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), is mandatory. Lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. All quotes should be valid for ninety (90) days and must be sent to Megan Ashley at megan.ashley@vandenberg.af.mil <strong>AND</strong> Sean Kenndy at sean.kennedy@vandenberg.af.mil or faxed to 805-606-5867 no later than <strong>3:00 PM PDT on&nbsp;30 August 2011. </strong></p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers pertaining to Statement of Work.<br />Question: CLIN OO5 : The annual health fair (four hours per session) is it supposed to read one "health fair" or "session" for each location and would the locations be the Yates Building and Rossyln Plaza or would it also include Franklin Court?<br />Answer: We have two health fairs annually--one at the Yates building; and one at the Rosslyn building--both on Wednesdays and 1 week apart; and both are in September. The Franklin Court employees can go to either site.
<p>Question: Under A. Scope - "The USDA is an equal opportunity employer and has severely physically challenged employees in the WO". Can you please describe the types of physical challenges USDA employees may have?<br />Answer: USDA has employees with disabilities as the rest of the Federal Government such as visibility impaired, hearing impaired, employees with wheelchairs, and other mobility and disability issues. All employees are welcome to participate in our program.</p>
<p>Question: Technical Requirements - 1. Primary Preventive Services (a) Health Assessment - Vendor provides blood screenings using a fingerstick method rather than a venapuncture. Would this be acceptable or are you looking for a venapuncture? Vendor and can provide the following tests via a fingerstick:<br />1. Full Blood Lipid Panel (TC, HDL, LDL, Triglycerides, TC/HDL Ratio) with or without Glucose<br />2. Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)<br />3. Thyroid<br />4. We do have the capabilities to do venapuncture through our partner. However for the purposes of the assessment, other lab values would not be needed (SMAC24, CBC). Also, the SMAC24 is now the Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP) and the Complete Blood Count (CBC) is also a different test (Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, etc) and not necessary for a wellness program biometric screening/prevention education.<br />Answer: Sorry, but we don't want the fingersticks. We need all of the tests that we stated.</p>
<p>Question: Under the Technical Requirements - 1. Primary Preventive Services (a) Health Assessment - can you please define what you mean by a "Physician's Review" of all health assessment results? At Vendor our cholesterol and glucose results are immediate and a health educator is onsite to review the results with individuals at that time for the "Teachable Moment". The PSA test is also a fingerstick test and sent of to the lab for analysis. Results can be sent either directly to the individuals or back to Vendor and reviewed individually with participants by a health educator.<br />Answer: Physical review means that a doctor reviews the results. All results are reviewed at the same time at a later time (about 2 weeks part) as part of our program.</p>
<p>Question: Under D. Primary Preventive Services Promotion and H. Wellness Seminar /Workshop Promotion - it states the WO Wellness Program Manager determines the appropriateness of all documents, etc. Is Vendor responsible for making all the copies, supplying the paper, etc. of documents or only supplying the WO Program Manager with the "content"? <br />Answer: Yes, the contractor is responsible for making any copies, etc., associated with the seminar.</p>
<p>Question: Can you elaborate on what exactly is expected of the "physician's review of all health assessment results" and what the expectation is for actual physician contact or liability regarding the employee?<br />Answer:</p>
<p>Question: Can you specifiy which exact blood work you are requesting? Do you also want a Complete Blood Count (CBC) in addition to the SMAC-24? Is the lipid profile going to be fasting or non-fasting?<br />Answer: We require only the tests listed in the statement of work. It will be a fasting test.</p>
<p>Question: The Solicitation at Section A in the Scope of Work states that there are physically challenged employees who might participate in the wellness program. In order for us to best respond to this requirement in our proposal, it would be extremely helpful to know the number of affected employees and the types of physical disabilities. <br />Answer: Don't know, as some employees may or may not identity their disabilities.</p>
<p>Question: In Section B, last sentence of the Solicitation, it states that the contractor must complete the "Washington Office Wellness Program Enrollment Form (see attached)". However, we cannot locate the attachment. Would it be possible to send or post the referenced attachment?<br />Answer: <br />WO Wellness Enrollment Form<br />(Sample Only--To be completed by WO Wellness Program Contractor.)<br />________________________________________</p>

<p>________________________________________ _______________ ____________<br />WO Wellness Program Contractor Title Date</p>
<p><br />Question: . The Solicitation at Section K references the anticipated award of a a BPA (Blanket Purchase Agreement) as a result of the Solicitation. Would you please confirm that a BPA is the type of contract that USDA anticipates awarding (as opposed to some other indefinite quantity-type contract?<br />Answer: The wording BPA or Blanket Purchase Agreement is in error. The contract vehicle will be a purchase order that can be billed against monthly.</p>
<p>Question: Section K also states that "the contractor should indicate the minimum number of WO [Washington Office] employees required to conduct health and fitness assessments and health risk appraisals on a quarterly basis, if required." Does this mean, for example, that if the Contractor states in its proposal, that ten employees must be enrolled in order to perform the assessments for that quarter - that is acceptable? Is there range (from 0 - 500) that USDA Forest Service has in mind as a minimum for employee participation within a given quarter?<br />Answer: a) yes; and b) about 50</p>
<p>Question: Section B.1.(d) of the Solicitation states that "Individual based prescription counseling sessions shall be conducted after each quarterly health screening cycle predicated on high risk factors...." Does this sentence denote USDA Forest Service's intent to create a medical provider-patient relationship between the Contractor and the WO employee?<br />Answer: No, the doctor only reviews the results.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being solicited and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W912L7-12-T-0001 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53. The Tennessee Army National Guard has the following requirements. This requirement is being advertised as a small business set-aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 562991 with a Small Business Size Standard of seven million dollars ($7,000,000.00) per year. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this Agency. The following clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical ability to meet the statement of work, price and past performance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (JUN 2006) (Deviation) 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity, 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services. As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives. The following wage rates apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.59 per hour or $143.60 per week or $622.27 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>

<p>The purpose of the HPT program is to increase the opportunity and likelihood of detecting illicit radiological/ nuclear material through constant, non-deliberate scans by detection devices that are worn by operators at all times as standard equipment. An additional, fundamental purpose of the HPT program is to function as personal protective equipment.<br />The goal for the HPT Industry Day event is to provide industry with information relevant to the program, including:<br />&bull; A list of draft requirements currently identified for a HPT device.<br />&bull; An overview of intended Concepts of Operation by potential end users.<br />&bull; An overview of new detection and networking technologies being developed by DNDO-Transformational and Applied Research Directorate (TARD) which could be implemented in a HPT device.</p>
<p>The registration form for the event and tentative agenda are enclosed. The list of HPT draft requirements to be discussed during the event is also enclosed. Due to the sensitive nature of the performance requirements, there are some To Be Determined (TBDs) in the enclosed draft requirements list. Values will be disclosed during the event to attendees who have signed and submitted the enclosed Non-Disclosure Agreement-(Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) Section only)for the event. Attendees are encouraged to submit questions with their completed registration forms in order to facilitate a question and answer session during the event. All releasable information provided during the HPT Industry Day will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website after the event.</p>
<p>The HPT Industry Day does not indicate a promise or intention to issue a request for proposals, request for quotes, or follow up acquisition of any type. DNDO will not assume liability for costs incurred by attendees or for preparations, travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, vendors' expenses in response to this notice are not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>
<p>Companies responding to this notification should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned business, and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business.

Due to security reasons, this requirement will be strictly followed and no late visitors' forms or walk-ins will be permitted.

This is an UNCLASSIFIED event; no security clearances are required. All DNDO information presented at the event will be made available via the Federal Business Opportunities website after the event.</p>

Vendors registering for follow-up meetings will be requested to submit applicable technical information, prior to their scheduled meeting, indicating how their COTS or near-COTS products meet each of the HPT draft requirements presented.</p>
<p><strong>Comments, Clarifying Questions, and Responses:</strong></p>

<DESC>Memorandum for Record					27 September 2011<br>SUBJECT: Soliciting from a Single-Source from Patriot Technologies, Inc for PD ALTESS.<br>1. In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), "for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source available," Patriot Technologies, Inc of Frederick, Maryland is solicited for a quote for WEBSENSE V5000 Appliance and Support upgrade and licensing. <br>2. Basis for solicitation of a single source is that PATRIOT Technologies, Inc is the contractor deploying the WEBSENSE System; therefore, a seamless transition will be gained by deploying Patriot Technologies' upgrades saving time and money and licensing. Conversely, using a different contractor will incur potential licensing issues, exorbitant restructuring/configuration costs, training and delayed time for synchronization of their upgrades with the Patriot Technologies' WEBSENSE system.<br>3. Market Research was conducted by                of PD ALTESS. Market research consisted of searching the worldwide web, to include the Government-wide contracting vehicles, to identify vendors that had the potential of providing Customer Survey software. There are several of them, but none can provide a seamless system upgrade transition along with allowing us to own a license that can be placed on our servers without incurring unreasonable costs and time considerations. <br>4. Based on the above rationale, the undersigned Contracting Officer has determined that an award to Patriot Technologies, Inc is in the best interest of the Government. <br>5. The point of contact for this action is .<br>                     				<br>PD ALTESS						Contracting Officer <br>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />1. Contracting Activity.<br />Contracting Activity: Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC), Acquisition Management Directorate, Code 02, 693 Neiman Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702, is acquiring on behalf of the requesting agency: Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), 503 Robert Grant Avenue, Silver Spring, MD 20901.
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved. <br />Approval is requested to award a single contract to GenVec Inc., 65 W. Watkins Mill Road, Gaithersburg, MD 20878 to</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services<br />The NMRC has a critical need to facilitate the manufacturing, testing and phase 1 clinical trial of a dengue vaccine using FDA cGMP guidelines. This requirement entails the production of two adenovirus vector-based vaccines under cGMP guidelines, from virus seed stocks, using the 293-ORF6 cell line. The first vaccine will consist of a 24 Liter production of dengue-1/dengue-3 bivalent vaccine based on a modified Ad5 vector, to cGMP standards suitable for clinical use. The second vaccine will consist of a 24 Liter production of dengue-2/dengue-4 bivalent vaccine based on a modified Ad5 vector, to cGMP standards suitable for clinical use. Both vaccines must be tested for sterility (including the absence of mycoplasma), vector concentration, infectivity, transgene expression, purity and identity. The two vaccines must then be combined and vialed. Oversight of all activities must be completed to ensure quality suitable for clinical use.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this contract is anticipated to be a single period of 180 days (no options). The type of funds being utilized in the base period are FY2010 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E).</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition. <br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), One source or limited sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority. <br />GenVec is the only source that can meet the requirements of the government because manufacture of both dengue vaccines requires the use of information proprietary to GenVec. <br />Both vaccines require use of GenVec's patented Ad5 vector and GenVec's patented 293-ORF6 cell line.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable. <br />The proposed contract was synopsized on the FedBizOpps website on 29 August 2011. No other known sources have expressed an interest in allele resolution genetic typing.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. <br />The Contracting Officer will perform a price analysis in order to determine that the anticipated cost to the Government of the services covered by this J&amp;A will be fair and reasonable. The Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) and past purchase history will form the basis of the price analysis.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition. <br />For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, NMLC has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the type of services covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, NMLC will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible.</p>
