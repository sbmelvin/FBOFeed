<DESC>The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting abstracts (white papers) and proposals for advanced research and development of Innovative Systems for Military Missions.  Innovative Systems are integrated systems or critical systems components, which often incorporate emerging advanced technologies, and which enable revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military. 

TTO seeks responses relating to five (5) Mission Thrust Areas (Mission Thrusts):

- Space Operations
- Land, Air, Sea and Space Platforms
- Unmanned Systems
- Directed Energy
- Precision Strike

Responses to the thrust areas may be submitted at any time during the open period of this solicitation. 

TTO's solicitation focuses on the high risk/high payoff development, integration, demonstration and evaluation of innovative systems or critical systems components enabled by, and incorporating, new or emerging technologies. Proposed efforts must also show significant promise to provide the U.S. military with revolutionary new mission capabilities, and/or enable significant increases in mission effectiveness.

Innovative system concepts of interest to TTO typically address emerging technical opportunities, advanced systems concepts, emergent threats, and/or new technology-enabled concepts of operation. TTO strongly encourages respondents to adopt a complete systems engineering approach to the problems.

This BAA solicits both abstracts (white papers) and proposals for proposed efforts. Offerors are strongly encouraged to initially submit a six page abstract (white paper) describing the offerors proposed concept.  Submission of an abstract (white paper) is not required prior to submitting a full proposal.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Adobe Acrobat Professional 9 and Adobe CS4 Design Premium.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. Adobe Acrobat Professional 8 creates high end design projects in .pdf format, which is the standard formatting of very large and complicated graphics files.  Adobe Acrobat, as the industry standard, has  been approved by the Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board  (CCB) for creating .pdf files.  According to the vendor, Acrobat Professional 8 allows users to PDF (portable document format) documents that comply with a host of industry standards, including PDF/X-1a, PDF/X-3, PDF/X-4 (draft), PDF/A, JDF, XMP metadata, and XML original. PDF documents can also be created from Microsoft Access, Excel, Internet Explorer, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Publisher, Visio, Word, and AutoDesk AutoCAD files. Text, tables, measurements, and embedded object data can be copied from other applications. Paper documents can be scanned to create searchable PDF documents. Layers in applications such as Visio or AutoCAD can be preserved in a PDF document. Headers, footers, watermarks, digital signatures, and access control can be added to any PDF document, and source documents of any format can be attached. Acrobat Professional 8 supports a variety of commenting tools, and both static and dynamic forms. Adobe Creative Suite 3 is a suite of applications, which as an industry standard, have been approved by the Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board (CCB) for high end design projects for both print and web media.  Adobe Creative Suite 3.3 Design Premium software is a toolkit for print, web, and mobile publishing.  It allows the user to create page layout designs. Object styles can apply formatting to graphics, text, and frames in several documents at once.  Individual layers of Adobe Photoshop and Acrobat files can be imported. The software is designed to allow objects to be imported from other designs with formatting and relative positions intact. Designs can be split into different elements for editing by several users. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.<BR><BR>

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 811219.	These services are only known to be available from Thomas Electronics, Inc., Clyde New York.  Thomas Electronics is the original manufacturer of the Cathode Ray Tube.  They are the only manufacturer to meet the performance standards required by the DBRITE system prime contractor for the fabrication of the DBRITE Cathode Ray Tube.

The test bed is one of a kind unit built for Thomas Electronics by Orwin Associates, and the Cathode Ray Tube cannot be calibrated and aligned to the required specifications without the use of the one of a kind test bed.  The electron gun is used in the repair of virtually all of the DBRITE Cathode Ray Tubes.

SPA Platform and must integrate precisely with existing equipment in terms of form, fit, function, and compatibility.  POC for information regarding this requirement is Ms. Becky Corwin, telephone 812-854-4292 or email rebecca.corwin@navy.mil; e-mail request is preferred.

<CONTACT>Phillip Morris 850-235-5387 , or Contracting Officer Wanda Cutchin at 850-636-6140.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source  follow-on Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation at 895 Oceanic Drive, Annapolis, MD 21401 to provide depot level repair, maintenance and modification to:
a)	AN/AQS-14A Sonar Detecting Setb)	AN/AQS-24 Mine Hunting Systemc)	AN/ALQ-141 Acoustic Minehunting/Minesweeping Systemd)	CP-2614T Common Post Mission Analysis (CPMA)e)	USM-668 Intermediate Level Test Equipment (ILTE)f)	Swivel Slip-Ring Assembly
This includes the conversion of the AN/AQS-14As to the AN/AQS-24 configuration, including the generation of all Integrated Logistics Support documentation to support the conversions.  The anticipated contract will be an IDIQ type contract with provisions for Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) for maintenance and repair services and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders for repair parts.  The contract will have a period of performance of five years (no options).  This option is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.
(a)	Northrop Grumman is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the only source of the AMCM equipment listed above since 1979.  As such, only Northrop Grumman has the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel to successfully complete the system overhauls and supporting documentation as well as the other tasking specified above.  Northrop Grumman is the sole developer of the AN/AQS-14 and AN/AQS-24 AMCM Sonar systems.  There have been no other contractual actions related to the direct development of these systems.  Northrop Grumman is the Depot facility for the above Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) systems.  Support Activity and the Drawing Configuration Manager for the AN/AQS-14A and AN/AQS-24 systems.  The Government views all software and drawing changes, but the software and drawings reside at Northrop Grumman under contract control.  (b)	Given the complexity of the AMCM systems and the level of system knowledge required to overhaul and repair this complex equipment and systems, Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking.  (c)	This is a follow-on contract for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  (d)	Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost (to date, approximately $20,000,000.00 in spare and repair parts as well as repair and overhaul services) to the Government.  These costs would not be recovered through competition.  The time required for another contractor to obtain the required authorizations, certifications, and data rights to perform the required repair and overhaul services would exceed five years.  This time estimate was derived from the amount of time which was required by Northrop Grumman to perform these identical tasks.  Such a delay could be disastrous to the AMCM warfare strategy until the Organic AMCM systems can be manufactured and fully integrated into fleet assets. 
In summary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f! irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   Combined Solicitation/SynopsisTotal Internal Reflection Microscopy Imaging SystemThis is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-09-00021.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-27.  This requirement is full and open competition. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The NAICS code is 334512.
SpecificationsThis request is for the purchase of a TIRF Imaging System used for studying the effect of pollutants on living cells.  Because this system will be interfaced with an existing confocal imaging system, the TIRF imaging system hardware must be compatible with NIS-Elements analysis software and associated drivers. 
To permit optimal live cell work, the TIRF imaging system must include a microscope that can provide laser-corrected constant focus adjustments.
To meet required performance quality standards, system must be equipped with a microscope capable of 0.25 micron steps, or better, in the z-axis.
To prevent additional expenditures, the imaging system must be compatible with existing Nikon objectives such as the Plan Fluor 110x /0.5-1.3 oil lens.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current Federal, State, and Local codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, and OSHA.

In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc.

Please send expressions of interest for evaluation purposes to the Governments Broker:

Experience in performing construction management services on construction projects of varying sizes and levels of complexity; and (3) Organization. This factor evaluates an offerors resources (personnel, organization, financial, and subcontractor/partners) to determine its ability to perform the requirements of the contract.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a noncompetitive Purchase Order using procedures authorized by FAR Part FAR 13.106-1(b) for Linktech UHMW Composite Polymer material for urgent supply and installation on Ecuadorian  Piranha shallow-water marine craft, to support Joint Ecuador/US counter narcotics operations.   The materials and associated installation components, and related warranty, from Linktech will be donated for use by the government of Ecuador under the Department's international narcotics and law enforcement program. 

This notice is not a request for proposals; this acquisition will be processed using the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b). Justification for other than full and open competition is that the Government requires urgent delivery of the material to refit existing Piranha watercraft in support of the Joint Ecuador/US Counternarcotics Program to apprehend, prosecute and convict criminal elements in Ecuador and only the equipment noted above will suffice. The Government has researched this technology and was unable to find any other companies able to meet the requirements. The required equipment must be compatible and able to interface with the existing watercraft operations in Ecuador. Only the items listed above have been identified to meet these needs

Solicitation is not available at this time. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to change the acquisition strategy.

The US NDC also serves as the data distribution center for all US government and authorized users for International Monitoring System (IMS) data. The focus of this phase is to add increased functionality to the current baseline, fine-tune current systems by increasing performance level, upgrade existing hardware, and sustain the present operational systems.</p>
<p><br />The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data acquisition and processing system which provides the capability to receive, process, archive and report events of interest in monitoring nuclear treaty requirements. It acquires waveform data from a global network of seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasonic stations. Data is stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external to AFTAC, and reliably forwarded to a classified processing system. The US NDC receives data from the International Data Center (IDC) originating from International Monitoring System (IMS) sensors on U.S. territory and from other countries. Users interactively review, refine, correct, and display currently available results.</p>
<p><br />The US NDC consists of the following components: (a) A 24x7 operations center located in the AFTAC Operations Center (AOC), Patrick AFB, FL (PAFB); (b) A 24x7 alternate (ALT) hot-backup system located at Goodfellow AFB, TX (GAFB); (c) A Training System located at the 312th Training Squadron GAFB; (d) A Remote Operations Center (ROC) located at PAFB (used to support unplanned and/or short term AOC outages, fire drills, etc.); (e) The US NDC Sustainment System (SUS, aka the test-bed) and (f) the US NDC Development System (DEVL), both located at AFTAC/PAFB.</p>
<p><br />Current System Parameters include the following:</p>
<p><br />1) Hardware: SUN SPARC-based servers and workstations, Storage area network drives, LTO3 tape archives<br />2) Software: Solaris 8 &amp; 10, Oracle 10g<br />3) Code: C, C++, FORTRAN, PERL, Scheme, SQL, Lisp, ASM, CSH, Java, Makefile, SH, TCL, YACC</p>
<p><br />The operational US NDC hardware (OPS, Alt, Training System, and Remote Operations Center) along with most of the development/sustainment hardware is and will continue to be maintained through a separate AFTAC maintenance support contract.</p>
<p><br />Contractor responsibility will include the development and integration of a total system including ongoing upgrades, advanced geophysical studies and tuning/optimization of software algorithms. All personnel must have a Secret clearance and all key personnel must have a Top Secret (SCI) clearance. A majority of the work will be done within the AFTAC building at Patrick AFB, FL. Therefore, the contractor must have or establish a facility in Florida and have key personnel available to work within AFTAC.</p>
<p>Examples of new and ongoing US NDC development and sustainment items include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p><br />1) One of the primary objectives of the Phase 4 effort is to provide a software and hardware architecture with implementation which will provide the platform for future system growth and enhancements. The functionality shall maintain and enhance existing data acquisition, detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation, event classification, event reporting, data distribution, and data archiving capabilities to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs as specified in the US NDC System Requirements Document (SRD).</p>
<p><br />2) A second major objective of the P4 effort is to make use of modern, object-oriented (OO) software design and development practices to re-architect the US NDC's legacy source code/software baseline that has evolved over the past 15+ years. The most immediate need/target is the interactive analysis tool suite.</p>
<p><br />3) Integration of 3rd party efforts: The Department of Energy (DoE) and Air Force labs, as well as various government contractors are involved in numerous areas of US NDC development. Some examples are: portions of the knowledge base, event classification methodology, and Geographical Information System (GIS). It will be the prime contractor's responsibility to team with these AFTAC partners and integrate their products.</p>
<p><br />4) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing Total System Integration Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC. The US NDC contractor is responsible for integration of hardware, COTS/GOTS software and calibration information, and contractor developed software into the US NDC system.</p>
<p><br />5) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing 24x7 on call support to insure 99% operational availability rate.</p>
<p><br />6) The US NDC contractor participates as a key member of the US NDC Change Management Board (CMB) to insure the US NDC will continue to meet the operational availability requirements. The CMB oversees the US NDC Change Request (CR) process and prioritizes O&amp;M work which includes but is not limited to software bug fixes and minor enhancements, adding new stations to data acquisition and both station and network processing.</p>
<p><br />7) Studies<br />a) Conduct scientific studies to help improve detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation and event classification to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs.<br />b) Conduct engineering and IT infrastructure studies (e.g., hardware, software, databases) to help improve overall system performance and help reduce maintenance costs and man power needs.<br />All applicable upgrades to the US NDC shall also be made to the training system, and to the Alt US NDC, both of which are located at Goodfellow AFB TX.</p>

<DESC><p>The Bureau of the Public Debt on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General is posting this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research related to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Audit for the Department of Homeland Security. Based on its market research, the Government will be assessing the following:
<p>1. Determine the availability of vendors capable of providing the consolidated Chief Financial Officer audit, their business size based on a NAICS code of 541211 which has a size standard of $8.5 million, whether or not the vendors have a GSA schedule that provides for these types of services, and assess past performance.<br />2. Assess the performance work statement.<br />3. Determine whether one contractor or multiple contractors should perform the audit. If the vendor is recommending that multiple contractors perform this work, identify how the components should be segmented and the timeline necessary to provide the component audit opinions that will allow the principal auditor to provide a consolidated opinion for DHS. <br />4. Determine whether the performance audits should be accomplished through a separate contract or as part of the CFO Audit. Provide rationale for your recommendation.<br />5. Determine whether the internal control audits over financial reporting should be performed by the Contractor performing the CFO audit. Provide rationale for your recommendation.<br />6. Provide the % of work that your company must accomplish in order to issue an opinion on a consolidated audit.<br />7. As a part of this audit, the Government requests that the Contractor not only provide the Notification of Finding and Recommendation (NFRs), but also provide a roadmap to facilitate the remediation of the findings.<br />8. If the vendor has provided consulting, accounting, or auditing services that may pose a potential conflict of interest, please indicate what those services are and when the services finished or are projected to finish.<br />9. Assess whether vendors have facility clearances and personnel cleared at the levels specified in the performance work statement.<br />10. Assess whether the work can be fixed-price. If not, what additional information does the vendor need to do so?<br />11. Provide pricing (ex. labor categories and hourly rates) for these types of services.</p>
<p><br />Vendors are encouraged to read the attached current performance work statement for the Chief Financial Audit and performance audits in fiscal year 2008. Also, the published Independent Auditor Opinions are located at http://www.dhs.gov/xoig/rpts/ by year under the management reports link. Attached are the number of hours that have been expended for Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007. Please note that each year the work changes based on the remediation of weaknesses as well as changing the scope at USCG in FY 2007. Beginning in FY 2007 the scope of work was changed to only validate the conditions leading to the disclaimer of opinion as USCG management did not to assert to accuracy of any the balances on the balance sheet. It should also be noted that the Department of Homeland Security is in the process of soliciting for a new financial system. It is anticipated that the new financial system will be implemented during the period of performance of any future contract issued for the CFO audit.</p>
<p>Your response should be sent to psb3@bpd.treas.gov no later than 2:00 p.m. on December 8, 2008. In your response, please reference RFI-FIG-09-0003 TW in the subject line. Public Debt is requesting information related to the issues shown above. At the Government's option, we may schedule in person meetings to discuss or clarify information provided in response to this RFI. The Government anticipates that these meetings, if necessary, will be held during the week of January 12, 2009 in the DC area. Please note that this information is being requested for information and planning purposes only as Public Debt is primarily interested in assessing the areas shown above. The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested. Public Debt will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above based on the information received. Dependent upon the results of this market survey, Public Debt anticipates issuing a solicitation to acquire these services. Any such solicitation would be based on a performance-based work statement. Please note that no solicitation document is available at this time.<br />Any questions related to this request for information shall be directed to the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer. No contact shall be made to DHS-IG staff.</p>

A key element of the surface aviation observations (METARs and SPECIs) is sky condition, which is provided automatically by a ceilometer which measures cloud height overhead, and then uses 30 minutes of cloud measurements to produce a sky condition report similar to that provided by a manual observer. 1.2) The current ceilometer that is installed on ASOS is out of production and must be replaced. After competitive procurement, a contract has been awarded to Vaisala, Inc. to replace the current ceilometer, which measures clouds to 12,000 feet with a modified commercial model CL31 ceilometer capable of measuring to 25,000 feet. The designation for this sensor is CL31 ASOS. As part of this procurement, the Government is responsible for compliance and field testing the ceilometer to demonstrate that its meets the requirements of the contract specification when installed in harsh winter locations.2.0 Goal:2.1) The overall goal is to evaluate the performance of the ceilometer during severe winter weather events. A specific area of concern is its detection and false reporting of subvisible ice crystal layers as clouds. The reporting of these layers as clouds has caused widespread criticism of the automated sky condition at locations where these subvisible clouds are likely to occur below 12,000 feet. Specifically these locations are in the northern tier of the U.S. and Alaska. Obviously with the introduction of ceilometers measuring to 25,000 feet, the likelihood of detecting these ice crystal layers will increase. To address this problem, the ceilometer contract specifically requires the vendor to propose strategies to prevent these subvisible ice crystal layers from being reported as clouds. The Government will be responsible for conducting a field test to assist the vendor in this effort and to provide high resolution data to specifically assist the vendor in analyzing the ceilometer backscatter profile to understand the nature of these subvisible layers. This will provide the vendor data to characterize these ice crystal layers and develop internal processing schemes to prevent them from being reported as visible clouds. The Government desires to evaluate the reporting accuracy of the CL31 ASOS during severe winter events to include frozen precipitation, fog, and high wind events.3.0 Approach:3.1) Vaisala has proposed tilting the ceilometer 12&ordm; from vertical to eliminate false ice cloud layer reports. Testing during Winter 2007/2008 demonstrated that this aggressive angle causes compliance issues. The NWS proposes a tile angle of 2-5 &ordm; degrees from vertical. This proposal is to install two CL31 ASOS 25,000 foot ceilometers at a location likely to experience subvisible ice crystal layers. One ceilometer would be tilted 2-5&ordm; and the other would be vertical. An older 12,000 foot ceilometer might be included to compare relative performance in ice crystal conditions3.2) The Government is tasked with identifying one or more locations where the test could be conducted, and to develop the necessary data collection system to acquire the data that will be required to support the post analysis that Vaisala will conduct to solve the problem. The Government seeks a location at over 6000 feet above sea level, and infrastructure to support scientific investigations. A key capability is a dedicated observing staff that could be tasked with checking the ceilometer to see if is detecting subvisible clouds and documenting the conditions under which it occurs. Extensive webcam views should also be available at the facility to assist in evaluating conditions.4.0 Pre- installation Activities:4.1) The selected site will provide the Government a proposal with item by item breakdown of cost to provide the infrastructure and staff to support this effort.4.2) The selected site will Identify a suitable location for the installation of equipment and data collection systems.5.0 Installation activities :5.1) Site personnel will prepare appropriate installation mounting fixtures adequate to reduce instrument vibration. If appropriate, site personnel will build appropriate shelters around the ceilometers to help shield them from gusty winds and lateral icing<br />5.2) Site personnel will assist with installation of ceilometers and associated data acquisition systems and connect to the internet. 5.2) Provide guidance to observation staff on observation procedures to identify and document the occurrence of false cloud layers caused by subvisible ice crystal layers.6.0 Post Installation activities:6.1) Provide supporting observations thorough a period of approximately 10 months, beginning in early winter 2008 and continuing through late Spring 2009. The Government anticipates some periods during winter icing season when sensors would be iced over and test would be suspended until the ice cleared.6.2) Provide internet connectivity to permit remote download of data at NWS test facility at Sterling, VA.6.3) Monitor DAS for outages, and ceilometers for ice blockage, conditions permitting.6.4) If the site is forecasted to be in the clouds for a long period, or if heavy icing is forecasted, cover the ceilometers if appropriate.6.5) At completion of the testing, site personnel will assist Government personnel in dismantling all Government provided equipment and preparing the equipment for shipment.7.0 Government Furnished Equipment:a) Two (2) ceilometers with necessary cabling;<br />b) One (1) Data Acquisition System;<br />c) Documentation containing the observational procedures necessary to<br />determine the presence of false cloud layers.</p>

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR COMMENTS AND SOURCES SOUGHT</p>
<p>The Office of Coast Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) makes the official nautical charts for the United States.  These charts are used aboard all commercial vessels, federal vessels, and many recreational boats to enhance the safety and efficiency of navigation, and for other purposes.  The printed, paper version of the nautical charts is manufactured using large-format inkjet printers and Print-on-Demand (POD) technology and, in a separate process, using lithographic printing.  This announcement deals only with charts printed using POD technology.</p>
<p>For Print-on-Demand nautical charts, NOAA compiles digital images of the nautical charts that are updated weekly, and maintains digital files of metadata.  The digital files are provided to a private sector partner who manages the files, assembles them into complete chart images, prints or has printed the results using inkjet printers, and sells the charts through its own network of retailers and distributors.  The private sector partner is compensated by its sales of the POD nautical charts.  No funds are provided by the government.</p>
<p>NOAA intends to accept a limited number of additional private sector POD partners.  These partners would, of necessity, have to develop sufficient software to manage, assemble, and print the NOAA digital chart files.  These partners would also have to establish a successful sales effort in order to be compensated.  The Agent Agreement governing these public/private partnerships and additional information is posted on the Internet at http://www.ocsdev.noaa.gov/PODagent/index.htm  (case sensitive).</p>
<p>NOAA is soliciting questions and comments on its intention, on the Agent Agreement, and is also soliciting non-binding statements of interest from entities interested in becoming a POD partner.  Respond by e-mail to PODagent@noaa.gov; by fax to 301-713-4019; by letter to Director, Office of Coast Survey, NOAA (N/CS), 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD, 20910; or by phone to David Enabnit, 301-713-2770 x132 or Richard Sillcox, 301-713-1968 x105.</p>

<p><strong>Background:<br /></strong>The MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) will produce completed Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel assemblies for use in domestic, commercial nuclear power reactors. The MFFF design for the United States will be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), ensuring compliance with the most stringent design standards. The NRC's regulations are found in Chapter I of Title 10, "Energy," of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The criteria contained in 10 CFR 50 - Appendix B, Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants, will be applicable to this procurement.</p>
<p>The MFFF is a multi-functional complex containing all of the plutonium handling, fuel processing, and fuel fabrication operations. The MOX Fuel Fabrication Building (BMF) is a multi-story, hardened reinforced concrete structure enclosing approximately 441,000 sq. ft.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Description:</strong><br />Prior to requesting cost proposals, MOX Services will conduct a Workshop beginning&nbsp;10-December 2008 to be held in Aiken, South Carolina to discuss Zirconium and Stainless Steel (SS) equipment utilized in the Aqueous Polishing (AP) portion of the MFFF.</p>
<p>The zirconium and stainless steel equipment items that are currently planned to be included in the workshop are as follows:<br />A) Zirconium evaporator systems<br />B) 310L NAG evaporator systems<br />C) Pulsed Columns, buffer pot tanks and structural support frames<br />These systems are critical components of the MFFF AP process.</p>
<p>The purpose of this EOI is twofold:<br />&#61656; To announce the Workshop and obtain a listing of qualified suppliers interested in attending the workshop and,<br />&#61656; To obtain a listing of interested suppliers who desire to pre-qualify, subsequently bid, and if successful, supply evaporators systems fabricated of zirconium and 310L NAG SS, and SS pulse columns.</p>
<p>The workshop will last from one to two days, and is currently being planned to start on the morning of December 10th 2008. During the workshop MOX Services will conduct a presentation that is planned to include scope of work, technical requirements, quality assurance and general requirements. Interested attendees will be assigned time slots after the MOX presentation to engage in two way dialogue to review concerns, paths forward (timing, approach and execution) and other questions related to the evaporators and pulse columns. Suppliers interested in bidding on these work scopes and supplying any of this equipment to MOX Services are strongly advised to attend the workshop, however attendance is not mandatory. Note: Cameras and recording devices will not be permitted.</p>
<p>Following the workshop and finalization of the Statement(s) of Work, Request for Proposals (RFP) will be solicited from qualified bidders to supply these components to MOX Services in accordance with the defined Statement(s) of Work (SOW) as summarized below.</p>
<p>Potential suppliers interested in attending the Workshop and/or to be considered to receive the RFP must provide the following information to the point of contact listed below.</p>
<p>1. Company information including company name, address and a main point of contact with phone number and e-mail address. <br />2. A brief description of company experience and capabilities, including applicable years of experience in providing this or like equipment. <br />3. A summary statement to describe the prospective supplier's Quality Program/Plan with regard to meeting requirements of ASME NQA-1 with 1995 Addendum and/or 10CFR50, Appendix B.<br />4. Statement of Intention to attend the Workshop as well as interest in reserving time for a one-on-one dialogue with MOX Services.<br />5. A signed Proprietary Information Agreement form (form will provided upon request)<br />6. Names and e-mail addresses for each attendee. Note: It is recommended that attendees be U.S. citizens. Foreign Nationals will require pre-approval.<br />7. Interested vendors can provide any additional pertinent information relevant to the stated procurement scope of work for MOX Service's review.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Statement of Work (SOW):</strong><br />The SOW includes all the labor, equipment, materials, and transportation as required to perform the final detailed design, design qualification and analysis (ASME and Seismic), fabrication, test and assembly in accordance with MOX Specifications, data sheets, detail and assembly drawings for the following equipment:</p>
<p>&bull; Zirconium and 310L NAG evaporator systems.<br />&bull; Pulsed Columns<br /><br />Upon delivery at the Savannah River Site, these items will be off-loaded, stored, and installed by others.</p>
<p>The evaporator system is designed to recover nitric acid from the process fluid effluents (raffinates) and recycle it back to the AP process. Each system is comprised of a hot water-heated boiler, evaporator, and interconnecting piping (including neutron counter boxes) assembled in a tubular structural support frame in accordance with the MOX Services design. Evaporator systems have a yearly operating cycle and are required to run continuously for 20 years. Fluid, thermal and thermodynamic design of the evaporator systems has been performed by MOX Services to meet the functional requirements of the MFFF.</p>
<p>Pulsed columns and pots handle radioactive fissile materials of varying neutron flux. Generally these items are specified as 304L and 316L SS. The geometry and configuration of the columns and pots ensures that the process remains in a sub-critical condition, and is in accordance with the MOX Services design. MOX Services has selected a variety of transient conditions as the design conditions for the design and fabrication of the pulsed columns, pots and tubular support structures. The input and output flows and the sizes of all connections are determined by MOX Services. The structural aspects are to be designed and fabricated by the Subcontractor.</p>
<p>This equipment is designated as Quality Level 1, an Item Relied on for Safety (IROFS). All material and services for the equipment furnished under the specification shall be furnished under a Quality Assurance Program approved by MOX Services for the work (e.g. design, qualification, procurement, fabrication, packaging and shipping of materials/equipment). The Subcontractor is required to have a documented Quality Assurance Program that implements 10CFR50 Appendix B, Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants as well as ASME NQA-1 1994 as revised by NQA-1a 1995 addenda.</p>
<p>The equipment and components require varying degrees of qualification and evaluation to withstand the effects of a seismic event (design earthquake) in order to prevent the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials.</p>
<p>Typically seismic Performance Requirements reflect the type of safety function performed:<br />&bull; SPR B1 SSC shall maintain nuclear material configuration<br />&bull; SPR B2 SSC shall maintain structural integrity<br />&bull; SPR B3 SSC shall maintain pressure boundary integrity</p>
<p>Qualification and evaluation requires design and analysis by a Professional Engineer and an appropriate NQA-1 Quality Assurance Program.</p>
<p>The RFP is scheduled to be issued during the first (1st) Quarter of 2009 with delivery on site July 2011.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Description of Equipment:</strong><br />Quality Level 1 evaporator systems scope includes the following quantities and types:<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quantity: 1 only, Zirconium system, fully assembled in a tubular structural support frame:<br /></span>A) Hot water-heated boiler<br />B) Evaporator<br />C) Interconnecting piping <br />D) Neutron counter boxes</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  STAT-USA is the electronic dissemination arm of the Economics and Statistics Administration. Its focus is on providing government information to American businesses and the public sector, including economics and international trade organizations and the educational community. STAT-USA is conducting market research to identify available sources for the proposed services below: 

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:  

STAT-USA requires an organization/company to provide daily releases of the FedBizOpps (previously Commerce Business Daily) and Defense Logistics Agency leads (DLA). FebBizOpps is a database of Federal Government procurement opportunities that are over $25,000 and are solicited by the entire federal contracting community. These bids/leads are made available to commercial vendors seeking federal markets for their products and services, allowing them to search, monitor, and retrieve these opportunities. They should also include awarded data, which shows the date, amount and company that was awarded the contract. DLAs are contracting opportunities that provide supplies and services to America's military forces worldwide. These bids/leads are made available to commercial vendors who may perform comprehensive and detailed searches against Request for Quotation and Award documents. 

STAT-USA requests that these bids/leads be provided within 12 to 24 hours from the time and date of posting . Each daily feed of bids/leads must be received by STAT-USA via FTP and must be in one zipped file per day, containing two bulk complete files separated by bid/lead type, i.e., one file containing all FebBizOpps and one containing all DLA. The bulk file format requirement is text, with specific field tags that will allow each field and bid/lead to be defined and differentiated between the other. Each bid/lead file-type has to be tag-delimited in such a way as to indicate the start and end of a new bid/lead, as well as the primary fields, date, company, title, and commodity/service and codes/descriptions.  The FedBizOpps bids/leads must contain the awarded data, when it becomes available. The date-stamp and naming convention for these files are: (a) zip file: EBB_mmdd.zip (example: EBB_1001.ZIP), which will contain two files inside, also date stamped: (b) yymmdd.FBO (example 081001.FBO) and (c) yymmdd.BSM (example 081001.BSM). STAT-USA also requests the ability to redisseminate the bids/leads to the STAT-USA customers. 

STAT-USA is also inquiring if awarded data is available for the DLA bids/leads, as well as if the Request for Quotations (RFQ) or Request for Information (RFI) that are linked in the individual DLA bids/leads can be received in their entirety, and if so what format and frequency.

The scope of this is to identify potential sources that have the capability to effectively and efficiently provide these bids/leads in a bulk format on a daily basis.  The government requests the interested parties to provide details on how the requirement should be priced.

Request companies interested in this project, email their company capabilities and information to Ms. Lisa R. Safewright at the below email address:

Email Address: Lisa.R.Safewright@census.gov 

This is not a request for proposal.

The Electric Utility Distribution System at Cape Cod AFS supports approximately 140 personnel, 100 acres, and 12 buildings. NSTAR will be required to comply with all service distribution requirements outlined in the solicitation, obtain all applicable permits, licenses and certifications necessary for performance, possess the financial resources necessary to provide uninterrupted electric utility distribution services, and to possess the financial resources required for capital improvements required by industry standards.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires the purchase of TeamMate Software. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to CCH, Inc.of 4025 West Peterson Ave., Chicago, IL 60646. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Monday, 19 November, 2008, 4:00 p.m. EST.<br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within four days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
<p>USSOCOM SOIG - Audit Division has used TeamMate software for several years. As a result, permanent audit files are stored using TeamMate. These files are not readily exportable into other audit software programs without considerable loss of data and breakage of critical data links. A significant portion of each audit project relies on review of prior audits. Much of this critical data would be unavailable without the renewal of the TeamMate software license. To purchase a similar software system from any source would significantly impact the operational effectiveness Additionally, the SOIG staff is trained to use TeamMate and use of other solutions would require extensive additional training costs. These costs include a minimum of 20 hours of training, ten users to learn how to use a new software. Assuming a minimum hourly wage rate of $30.00, per person, it would cost the Government an estimated $6,000.00 just to train its employees to use a new software.. This cost does also not include the additional costs that would have to be expended for testing and certifying a new software. These costs far exceed the Government estimate to purchase the TeamMate software. In summary, there would be a substantial duplication of costs, not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.</p>

The contract will represent a renewal to the agency's existing Haver DLX Database System.
<p>Several features of the Haver DLX system make it unique. The proprietary software was designed to have the Haver DLX server transfer the data updates to a local network server. With all the databases available on a network server, the system allows unlimited simultaneous users to access identical data rather than individual users performing separate modem downloads at various points in time. The data provided by Haver Analytics is as it is reported from the data source. Haver is not in the forecasting and econometric modeling business and therefore this type of service is not part of their databases as is the case with other companies. In addition, data can easily be retrieved into Microsoft Excel, exported into other file formats such as SAS, and graphics can be imported into both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. The Haver DLX system includes unlimited refreshes of data updates, monthly newsletters, software updates and access to the Haver Website. The system also includes a one year subscription to the following databases: USECON; CBDB; REALTOR; USINT; G10+; FFUNDS; REGIONAL; LABORR; EMPLC; EMPLR; USPOP; PIQR; PICOUNTY; DLINQ; DLINQR; USMSCA; EUROPE; JAPAN; EMERGEMA; EMERGE; EMERGELA; IMFDOT; WBDEBT; INDUSTRY; HUD; MBAMTG;A ND EXPORTSR. The period of performance will be January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009.</p>
<p>Contractors with this capability may submit a proposal with pricing to be considered by the government no later than 2:00 pm ET on November 24, 2008. This may be sent to: PSB3@BPD.TREAS.GOV , Attn: Mcrouser. Please reference: Haver DLX Databases.</p>
<p><br /><br />Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that all persons on the mailing list will receive notifications. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. If the Internet option is not available to you, you may fax your request to (304) 480-7204 or e-mailing your request to psb3@bpd.treas.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) is considering a supply chain management contract that will provide innovative and responsive logistics support to our military customers for Federal Supply Classes (FSCs) 4710, 4720, 4730, 4820, 5330, 5331, 5930, 5935, 5961, 5962, and 6145.  This initiative will capitalize on suppliers' and the Government's expertise, business practices, and ability to improve the logistics support process while increasing both supply availability and parts reliability.  This will in turn translate into improved support to customers at a lower cost to the DoD.  The intent is to award multiple contracts for the above FSCs or industry segments within those FSCs.  To inform the business community of the initiative, the Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC), located in Columbus, Ohio, will host an Industry Day on Wednesday, December 3, 2008.  
With the evolving mission needs of the war fighter, DSCC aims to improve support and readiness to our military customers.  This complete solution will require that the contractor perform various responsibilities to include supply chain and inventory management, parts acquisition, distribution, warehousing, transportation, and material forecasting for various industry segments for the given FSC's.  The resulting contracts will improve DLA's logistics response time and increase mission readiness at a cost comparable to traditional support methods.  The Government contemplates that the term of the contracts will consist of a 4 year base period with two (3-year) option periods for a total of 10 years.
During the conference, the overall project concept, goals, and objectives will be discussed in greater detail.  Additionally, guidance will be provided to the small business community concerning opportunities for their participation.
DLA is interested in receiving industry comments, questions, recommendations, and ideas regarding this initiative.  Please send your questions/comments to the email address below by Friday, November 21, 2008, 12:00 PM EST with your company name and address, CAGE code and a primary point of contact to include telephone number and e-mail address.
Additional information regarding this acquisition will be posted on the DSCC website, http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/FSCInitiatives/index.html.
If you would like to attend this Industry Day, please RSVP by Friday, November 21, 2008 using the e-mail address: DSCC.Maritime.FSC@dla.mil.

<DESC>Naval Air Weapons Center is requesting information relating to concepts for selectable output weapons.  Responses to this RFI will be used by the Navy to perform studies and analyses on existing and future weapons capable of being deployed from current and future manned and unmanned platforms to perform required missions.  Some responders may be asked for more information or to visit for discussions.
The Navy is working to develop weapons that give the warfighter the flexibility to select a variable damage radius that a weapon could generate, or possibly the type of effect a weapon will place on a specific target.  Current asymmetric warfare scenarios require some targets to be immediately neutralized with minimal effect to the surrounding area.  Targets vary from buildings, to personnel in the open, and to personnel located in complex urban settings.  Current cylindrical steel-cased blast fragmentation warheads distribute fragmentation radially in all directions from the detonation point.  Often, many fragments travel far beyond the intended target.  These fragments can create collateral damage hazards, especially for Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) and close air support (CAS).  Thus, some of these operations require restricted rules of engagement which dictate tight control of collateral damage.
Currently no technology has been proven to be available that can deliver variable damage radius from one build configuration.  Developing this sort of weapon could improve tactical flexibility and effectiveness by maximizing the number of kills per sortie and reducing the timeline necessary to prosecute a wider spectrum of targets.   Please submit white paper with 10 pages maximum, 12 font, single spaced.  It is requested the information submitted include the below list of general characteristics.   However, it is realized that there may be submissions that do not, or cannot, meet one, or several, characteristics of the below list.  All submissions are encouraged and will be read.
  (i)	The weapon should be of an air to ground configuration.
  (ii)	The weapon should be capable of being deployed primarily by fighter aircraft with a desired capability of being deployed off of bombers, Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), and special mission aircraft.
  (iii)	The total weight of the weapon should not exceed 1000 lbs.
 (iv)	The weapon should have at least two (2) selectable output modes (> 2 is acceptable).

(v)	Provide any estimates for lethal and collateral damage radii of effect for proposed weapon.
  (vi)	Please indicate when it is envisioned that a concept would be mature enough and available for a Milestone B and Engineering & Manufacturing Development && Demonstration.
  (vii)	Provide notional programmatic information including top level schedules and order of magnitude costs necessary to achieve a mature system to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Demonstration phase by, or before, the 2015 timeframe.

Responders are encouraged to provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts with the Government that support the desired capabilities described.  Additionally, further information/details may be requested based on initial submittals.  Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights.  However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  The Government does not plan to award a contract based on the responses from this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs of charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information.!   This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government.

<DESC>TSA intends to award a sole-source contract for Railroad Operations and Safety Training to the Transportation Technology Center, Inc (TTCI).  TTCI is the only vendor that offers this specialized training, because it is the sole steward of the Emergency Response Training Center (ERTC), operated on land managed and controlled by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).  The specialized training can only be conducted at this location due to varied resources available there.  These resources include a fully functional and operational railroad infrastructure, 69 railway freight cars, which include cars in four simulated derailment settings, 15 passenger rail cars, 25 highway cargo tanks, van trailers, and Intermodal containers.  Students at ERTC have unlimited access to every type of passenger and freight railcars and containers commonly encountered in rail transportation.  The facility also includes approximately 52 square miles of training infrastructure that includes standard freight rail track, an electrified third rail system which is commonly used in the mass transit subway system(s), an electrified overhead catenary system used by systems such as Amtrak, as well as several mock train derailments.

This contemplated contract is for a base and four option years, totaling a five-year potential period of performance.  TTCI provides specialized training in railroad operations and safety, as well as combined classroom and hands-on field exercises to reinforce the principles and techniques identified and learned in the classroom.  
 
The training program required by TSA is a comprehensive overview of the entire railroad industry, including freight, passenger, commuter, subway, and light rail systems.  The anticipated scope of the contract shall include the following training elements, at a minimum:
Principles of Rail Systems, Rail and Transit Organizations, Rail System Safety, Rail System Security, Track and Structures, Rail Networks, Types of Trains, Train Control and Communication Systems, Control Systems and Performance Monitoring Technology, Rail Freight Operations, Rail Passenger Operations, Locomotive Technology, Freight Car Technology, Passenger Vehicle Technology, Hazardous Materials Transportation, Tank Cars, Intermodal Containers, Weapons of Mass Destruction, Rail System Disruptions, Emergency Response and Incident Management Process within the railroad industry.

The training program shall also consist of hands-on exercises designed to familiarize TSA inspectors, and others as authorized by the STSI Program Office, with the systems and technologies discussed in the classroom setting, as well as the processes used in the railroad environment and during emergency response activities.  A variety of modern freight and passenger rail equipment shall be used in the field exercises. The field exercise location must be large enough to contain a mock freight train derailment with a variety of rail cars used in the static display for Inspectors to evaluate.   

TTCI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Association of American Railroads, a not-for-profit trade association which operates and maintains the Department of Transportations (DOT) Transportation Technology Center under a Care, Custody, and Control contract with DOTs Federal Railroad Administration. TTCIs mission is to provide research, design, testing, training, analysis, evaluation, management, and engineering support to the worlds railway transportation industry. In accordance with DOT/FRA policy, TSA must contract with TTCI in order to use DOTs Transportation Technology Center.

TTCIs Emergency Response Training Center (ERTC), on land leased by the DOT/FRA, is the only training center of its kind in the world. No other railroad training facility possesses the infrastructure, expertise and personnel necessary to deliver a comprehensive combination of hands-on and classroom training. 

The U.S. Mass Transit Systems (freight and passenger rail, highway) require the ability to prevent and/or manage the consequences of terrorist attacks. TTCIs training facility is the only location that can fill this need.  TTCI, through H.R. 1 (9/11 Act Section 1204 (b)(6)), has been appointed a member of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Domestic Preparedness Consortium (NDPC) whose duties are to identify, develop, test, and deliver training to State, local, and tribal emergency response providers, provide on-site and mobile training at the performance, management and planning levels, and facilitate the delivery of training by the training partners of the Department.

The Transportation Security Administration has concluded, based on past experience and available market research, that competition is not readily available.   While there are many vendors that offer training and training development, no vendor, other than TTCI has the hands-on facilities that the STSIP training requires.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a fixed price quotation is requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-09-Q-0013 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27 effective October 17, 2008. This is a Brand Name, 100% Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside requirement under NAICS 334119 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.  The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussions of this procurement. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation. Award will be made to the vendor whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this order will be obtained through a lowest priced technically acceptable evaluation. REQUIREMENTS: This is a Brand Name, firm-fixed price request and all delivery costs must be included in total estimated value. NARA requires that all Cisco products be purchased from Authorized/Certified Vendors Only.  Any and all vendors submitting quotes shall provide proof of authorization and equipment support from Cisco.  Please refer to attached amendment.

CLIN: 0001  Version 1 Pre-Assembled Cisco Router; 1 Ea; CLIN: 0002  Version 2 Pre-Assembled Cisco Router; 1 Ea.  (see schedule A). DESCRIPTION: The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) needs a Network that is up to date and complies with the NARA Enterprise Architectures Technology Standards Profile and Data Center standards.  The infrastructure hardware being procured integrates into the existing NARAs infrastructure seamlessly to provide cohesive and unified monitoring, configuration management and security controls from College Park, MD.  CISCO brand infrastructure equipment is necessary to effectuate the seamless integration into NARAs existing environment, and standardizing NARAs existing CISCO system will preclude the significant problems associated with network outages such as work stoppage and data loss.  NARA is now focusing on 2 new routers to replace the existing Cisco B router and MPR router.  Also, NARA requires an upgrade to wide area network (WAN) infrastructure at College Park and St Louis to support a transition to the Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network.  The infrastructure hardware being procured integrates into the existing NARAs NARANET standard infrastructure seamlessly to provide cohesive and unified monitoring, configuration management and security controls from College Park, MD.  NARA requires routers to be Pre-Assembled prior to delivery. Only NEW Cisco brand parts will be considered for the essential security component of the Network Transition project.  As part of this technology refresh, we intend to install Cisco appliances to meet current FISMA security requirements for capturing system log in and activity. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice.

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;
 (g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 


(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached. 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Are either pick up points beyond a security desk that would force us to relinquish our firearms? 2.      Will our guards be forced to be escorted to the pick up point?3.      Is there anything else we need to know about that would add additional time to our crew once we arrive at the location?4.      We only authorize our crew to sign the Deposit Log that we issue to all our customers.  Is that an issue?5.      We certainly can and will take full responsibility for any deposit(s) we sign for at either location.  However, for pricing purposes if you could give me the average daily Cash and Check breakdown amount I can present you with a more competitive price.  Otherwise I would have to assume that we will be required to insure $1M per pick up which would be quite costly.6.      Time of pick up and delivery of deposits is very restrictive. Can the locations be more flexible?  For example, the vast majority of our customers are set up with "in route" service (service can be provided anytime throughout the customer's hours of operation).  This allows us to be even more competitive with our pricing.  This is very important to know because there is a very good chance that we would not be able to satisfy the very restrictive times noted in the scope of services. 
ANSWERS1.  No
2.  no
3.  no
4.  no
5.  Maximum liability is $50,000 per pick up/delivery per day.  If we had a deposit that exceeded this amount this office would make the deposit themselves.   
6.  I understand the times are quite restrictive, but they are very important.<BR><BR>

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC><p>The solicitation number is FA8773-08-R-0054, and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This amended solicitation/synopsis, BPA Terms and Conditions, Price list and SOW replaces FA8773-08-R-0054 in its entirety.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p><br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize full and open competition; there are no set asides for small businesses. For this acquisition, a concern will be considered small under NAICS 517110 with size standard of 1500 employees.</p>
<p>Simplified procurement procedures will be used for this acquisition per FAR Parts 12 and 13. This acquisition is determined to be subject to FAR Part 13, Test Program for Certain Commercial Services of the FAR regarding the acquisition of commercial services and also subject to FAR Par 15 regarding contracting by negotiation.</p>
<p>In accordance with Air Force (AF) Instruction 33-111, the 38th EIG is the only authorized contracting office to order local exchange telephone services for the AF including Air National Guard, AF Reserve and AF recruiting offices. 38 EIG/PKK has a requirement for awarding Firm-Fixed Price Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for an effective period up to ten years in order to, on an as-needed basis, acquire local telephone exchange services for all AF sites throughout the United States (CONUS). All BPA calls are referenced herein as "Communication Service Authorizations" (CSAs) and subject to the terms and conditions of the BPA. Each CSA will generally have a five-seven year period of performance but can be issued from one to 10 years. Local telecommunications services shall include, as a minimum but not limited to, local access for ISDN PRI's, local exchange trunks, transport channels, point-to-point circuits, commercial business lines, internet services, voice mail, directory number and number portability, operator and directory assistance, local and Intra-LATA access, and interconnection with Inter-LATA exchange carrier.</p>
<p>38 EIG/PKK intends to negotiate multiple BPAs with qualified sources in order to competitively award CSAs for local exchange services. Responding to this synopsis in no manner guarantees a BPA will be negotiated with the respondent. The establishment of a BPA with a respondent in no way obligates the Government to issue any CSAs against the BPA. 38 EIG/PKK does not guarantee any minimum level of work under any resultant BPA. Individual CSAs will not exceed $5.5 million. There will be no limit to the number of CSAs issued under any of the prospective BPAs. The Government may issue orders requiring services at multiple locations. Only 38 EIG/PKK will be able to issue CSAs against the established BPAs. There is no specific commitment by either party, until dates, services, and schedule are mutually negotiated by individual CSAs against resulting BPAs. Offers may be submitted through February 2018. A respondent may at any time submit a proposal electronically via email or by fax requesting establishment of a BPA from the POC's e-mail listed in the announcement. Phone requests will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The scope of the work to be acquired for the BPA is set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW). The SOW, Pricing Sheet, and BPA terms and conditions are available for download herein.</p>

<p>Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum. <br />52.212-2 Addendum 1:<br />EVALUATION CRITERIA. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />a. Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for a BPA. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing of each state the Offeror can provide services for under this BPA. In addition, this factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative applicable to each state. List shall include both AF contracting representatives and technical representatives to include the site poc for help desk tickets and trouble shooting.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offer provides documented evidence of CLEC (Competitive Local Exchange Carrier) interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort in each state and the Offeror is a facilities based firm. Documented evidence shall be who the interconnection agreement is with, the period of performance for the agreement, and the legal docket number filed with the PUC.</p>
<p>FACTOR 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation IAW Clause 52.212-4, Addendum paragraph (q) (2) in order to provide the services for these types of requirements. For each state the Offeror is submitting the BPA proposal, the documentation and/or direct internet link must be provided. If the government does not have access to the direct link provided, documentation shall be provided upon request. Documentation shall be from the PUC certificating the vendor IAW clause 52.212-4 addendum paragraph (q)(2) and the dates of the certification.</p>
<p>Factor 4-Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror understands and meets all the SOW requirements as a facilities based provider.</p>
<p><br />b. Past Performance Evaluation. BPA offerors will be assessed a satisfactory past performance rating in order to obtain a BPA. CSA award decisions for defined requirements will be based on the Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) technique as defined in the BPA terms and conditions. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the BPA holder's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents theGovernment's judgment of the probability of a BPA holder successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the BPA holder's demonstrated present and past performance. The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. nfidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. A BPA will be made to this vendor, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />c. Price Evaluation. All pre-priced CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. When the sites requirements are defined, proposals for pricing on the Schedule B will be evaluated with the PPT process described in BPA terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>NOTIFICATION:&nbsp; THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN SET ASIDE FOR COMPETITION AMONG 8(a) CERTIFIED FIRMS NATIONWIDE.&nbsp; THIS NOTIFICATION IS PROVIDED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND COMPANIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR PROVIDE ANY RESPONSE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Original Posting:&nbsp;</p>
<p>This request is an announcement for information for planning purposes only. This sources sought does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Request for Quote, or Invitation for Bid. Nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government's acquisition approach.</p>
<p><br />The Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC) is seeking interested sources for Phase 4 (P4) of the US National Data Center (US NDC) program. The US NDC is the geophysical data acquisition, data processing, reporting and archiving component of the United States Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) operated by the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC). AFTAC's mission is to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties to standards set by US verification and policy leaders. This mission requires the US NDC to detect, locate and identify foreign nuclear tests and provide rapid reporting and technical assessment to the appropriate national security agencies and policy makers. The US NDC processes and integrates data and information up to and including the Department of Defense (DoD) SECRET level. The US NDC also serves as the data distribution center for all US government and authorized users for International Monitoring System (IMS) data. The focus of this phase is to add increased functionality to the current baseline, fine-tune current systems by increasing performance level, upgrade existing hardware, and sustain the present operational systems.</p>
<p><br />The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data acquisition and processing system which provides the capability to receive, process, archive and report events of interest in monitoring nuclear treaty requirements. It acquires waveform data from a global network of seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasonic stations. Data is stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external to AFTAC, and reliably forwarded to a classified processing system. The US NDC receives data from the International Data Center (IDC) originating from International Monitoring System (IMS) sensors on U.S. territory and from other countries. Users interactively review, refine, correct, and display currently available results.</p>
<p><br />The US NDC consists of the following components: (a) A 24x7 operations center located in the AFTAC Operations Center (AOC), Patrick AFB, FL (PAFB); (b) A 24x7 alternate (ALT) hot-backup system located at Goodfellow AFB, TX (GAFB); (c) A Training System located at the 312th Training Squadron GAFB; (d) A Remote Operations Center (ROC) located at PAFB (used to support unplanned and/or short term AOC outages, fire drills, etc.); (e) The US NDC Sustainment System (SUS, aka the test-bed) and (f) the US NDC Development System (DEVL), both located at AFTAC/PAFB.</p>
<p><br />Current System Parameters include the following:</p>
<p><br />1) Hardware: SUN SPARC-based servers and workstations, Storage area network drives, LTO3 tape archives<br />2) Software: Solaris 8 &amp; 10, Oracle 10g<br />3) Code: C, C++, FORTRAN, PERL, Scheme, SQL, Lisp, ASM, CSH, Java, Makefile, SH, TCL, YACC</p>
<p><br />The operational US NDC hardware (OPS, Alt, Training System, and Remote Operations Center) along with most of the development/sustainment hardware is and will continue to be maintained through a separate AFTAC maintenance support contract.</p>
<p><br />Contractor responsibility will include the development and integration of a total system including ongoing upgrades, advanced geophysical studies and tuning/optimization of software algorithms. All personnel must have a Secret clearance and all key personnel must have a Top Secret (SCI) clearance. A majority of the work will be done within the AFTAC building at Patrick AFB, FL. Therefore, the contractor must have or establish a facility in Florida and have key personnel available to work within AFTAC.</p>
<p>Examples of new and ongoing US NDC development and sustainment items include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p><br />1) One of the primary objectives of the Phase 4 effort is to provide a software and hardware architecture with implementation which will provide the platform for future system growth and enhancements. The functionality shall maintain and enhance existing data acquisition, detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation, event classification, event reporting, data distribution, and data archiving capabilities to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs as specified in the US NDC System Requirements Document (SRD).</p>
<p><br />2) A second major objective of the P4 effort is to make use of modern, object-oriented (OO) software design and development practices to re-architect the US NDC's legacy source code/software baseline that has evolved over the past 15+ years. The most immediate need/target is the interactive analysis tool suite.</p>
<p><br />3) Integration of 3rd party efforts: The Department of Energy (DoE) and Air Force labs, as well as various government contractors are involved in numerous areas of US NDC development. Some examples are: portions of the knowledge base, event classification methodology, and Geographical Information System (GIS). It will be the prime contractor's responsibility to team with these AFTAC partners and integrate their products.</p>
<p><br />4) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing Total System Integration Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC. The US NDC contractor is responsible for integration of hardware, COTS/GOTS software and calibration information, and contractor developed software into the US NDC system.</p>
<p><br />5) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing 24x7 on call support to insure 99% operational availability rate.</p>
<p><br />6) The US NDC contractor participates as a key member of the US NDC Change Management Board (CMB) to insure the US NDC will continue to meet the operational availability requirements. The CMB oversees the US NDC Change Request (CR) process and prioritizes O&amp;M work which includes but is not limited to software bug fixes and minor enhancements, adding new stations to data acquisition and both station and network processing.</p>
<p><br />7) Studies<br />a) Conduct scientific studies to help improve detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation and event classification to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs.<br />b) Conduct engineering and IT infrastructure studies (e.g., hardware, software, databases) to help improve overall system performance and help reduce maintenance costs and man power needs.<br />All applicable upgrades to the US NDC shall also be made to the training system, and to the Alt US NDC, both of which are located at Goodfellow AFB TX.</p>

<DESC>Addendums 2 and 3 have been issued and are available from www.blueprintonline.com.  All plan holders will be provided electronic copies of each addenda by blueprinton line.

This amendment changes the RFP due date from November 21, 2008 to December 5, 2008


Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC, (BSA) under Contract DE-AC02-98CH10886, for the operation of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), herewith solicits your proposal for the Conventional Facilities construction of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).

PROJECT INFORMATION
The conventional facilities required for the NSLS-II will include a Ring Building of approximately 392,000 square feet. 

The Ring Building will serve as the centerpiece of the NSLS-II and will house offices for the visiting user community, laboratory space, the main accelerator ring, experimental beamlines, experimental floor area, and supporting facilities. 

The proposed construction type for the Ring building will be reinforced slab on grade with perimeter footing, structural steel frame with composite reinforced concrete slab on metal deck for the upper floors, and insulated metal panel exterior. Roofing may be a combination of standing seam metal roof, built-up bitumin or membrane roof systems. 

Although the building design will generally involve standard commercial design and construction techniques, there are some additional considerations due to the specific requirements of the accelerator, experimental beamlines, and types of research that will take place in laboratory spaces. Placement of the floor slab will involve an estimated 35,000 cubic yards of concrete, with special consideration given to minimization of differential settlement to assure alignment integrity of the installed accelerator and beamlines. The NSLS-II Ring Building has been designed to minimize sources of vibration and transmission of vibration that would impact beam stability in the accelerator and experimental beamline areas and laboratory spaces. Additionally, the building design minimizes electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) in the experimental beamline areas, certain portions of the accelerator, and laboratory spaces by the routing of electrical cabling and placement and shielding of electrical equipment. There are specific temperature stability requirements in the accelerator, experimental beamline and certain laboratory spaces that will require a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system and control design that exceeds standard commercial practices.

This acquisition is a "Best Value" procurement.   Best Value employs a trade-off process that permits award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or other than the highest technically rated Offeror. BSA will evaluate proposals, in accordance with the following six criteria: contractor safety record and program, past performance in comparable work, key project personnel, major subcontractor safety and performance record, project management and quality assurance/quality control.

BSA places great importance on worker safety and the maintenance of a safe worksite.  Therefore, a safety incentive has been included as part of this procurement.  The safety incentive is based on the following factors; 1) Accident/Injury Rates; 2) Serious violation of OSHA requirements and 3) Responsiveness to less serious OSHA requirements.  

The estimated cost for construction of the NSLS-II Ring Building is approximately $180,000,000.00 to $205,000,000.00.

GENERAL INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS
Plans and specifications may be obtained from BlueprintOnline. Costs associated with obtaining these documents will depend on the number of documents ordered. Detailed instructions for accessing plans and specifications at http://www.blueprintonline.com are contained in Enclosure 5 of attached RFP.

<DESC>QUESTIONS FROM NATIONAL AND STATE PARK CONCESSIONS CADES COVE, LLC:

QUESTION 1
Principal Selection Factor 2 Subfactor 2a, General:Will the Service consider allowing a new modular building to replace the existing structure to allow visitor access into a store atmosphere?
NPS RESPONSE:The Service would consider approving the installation of a modular building or buildings to replace the existing structure to meet the requirements in Section 8(e)(3) of the Draft Contract.  Such modular structures could be used to create the enclosed, lockable storage space required by the Draft Contract.  However, the Service would not approve the installation of an enclosed building that would be accessible to the public for retail sales or use of the existing enclosed storage rooms in this manner.  The Draft Contract requires the Concessioner to provide "a covered area for vending machines, camper convenience item sales displays, sales area, and employee work area."  By "covered area", the Service means an open sided or partially open sided, roofed shelter to accommodate these services.

QUESTION 2
Principal Selection Factor 2 Subfactor 2a, General:Will the Service consider allowing connection of water and or sewer utilities to the concession building?
NPS RESPONSE:The Service would consider allowing connection of the Concession Facilities to the existing water and sewer system in Elkmont Campground.  However, since the Draft Contract does not allow the Concessioner to make Capital Improvements, the installation of water and sewer lines to the Concession Facilities would have to be made by the Service.  The Concessioner would be responsible for the installation of fixtures and connection to water and sewer lines.  If the Service provides water and sewer service to the Concessioner, the Service would bill the Concessioner for these services in accordance with Applicable Laws.  Although the Service will consider a request by the Concessioner to provide water and sewer service, the Service is not making any commitment at this time to actually provide these services.  
 
QUESTION 3
Principal Selection Factor 2 Subfactor 2a, General:What type of waste disposal system is utilized at the Elkmont restrooms adjacent to the concession site?
NPS RESPONSE:The Elkmont restrooms adjacent to the concession site are connected to an activated-sludge, wastewater treatment plant that handles wastewater from Elkmont Campground facilities.  Wastewater from the restrooms is collected by a gravity sanitary sewer system that serves the Campground.

QUESTION 4
Principal Selection Factor 2 Subfactor 2a, General:Will the service allow a central air and heat unit for the concession?
NPS RESPONSE:The Service will consider approving the installation of a central heating and air conditioning system if the electrical service to the Concession Facilities can support this equipment or can be upgraded to support this equipment.  The Service would also consider approving a window type heating and air conditioning unit.  This equipment would have to be installed to meet applicable electrical codes.

QUESTION 5
Principal Selection Factor 2 Subfactor 2a, General:If sewer/septic is not available, will the Service allow installation of above ground holding tank that could be pumped out by a mobile unit?
NPS RESPONSE:The Service would not approve the installation of an above ground holding tank due to the proximity of the Concession Facilities to the stream.
 
QUESTION 6
Principal Selection Factor 2  Subfactor 2a C):Will the Service consider allowing an expansion of convenience items, gifts, groceries, food services, and souvenirs to better serve the visitors of the Park if proper merchandising displays and areas are provided?
NPS RESPONSE:The Required and Authorized Services are described in Section 2(a) of the Draft Contract.  Additional information is provided in Section IV of Exhibit A, Draft Operating Plan and Attachment 1 to Exhibit A.  The specific Camper Convenience Items that may be sold will be approved by the Superintendent. 

QUESTION 7
Principal Selection Factor 2  Subfactor 2C b):Will the Service allow the addition of rental equipment?
NPS RESPONSE:The Required and Authorized Services are described in Section 2(a) of the Draft Contract.  Additional information is provided in Section IV of Exhibit A, Draft Operating Plan.  The Service will not approve any expansion of these Services beyond what is described in the Draft Contract and Draft Operating Plan.

QUESTION 8
Is there a minimum or maximum area for temporary facilities a Concessioner may use under the Draft Contract?
NPS RESPONSE:The Draft Contract does not specify a minimum or maximum area for the required temporary facilities.  However, the Service will not approve temporary facilities that are significantly larger than the existing temporary facilities or facilities that are too small to serve the functions described in the Draft Contract.  

QUESTION 9
Is there any overhead storage in the existing storage room that is currently used to store camper convenience items and other stock?
NPS RESPONSE:There is currently no storage space above the ceiling of the existing storage room.

QUESTION 10
Is running water available in the Concessioner's assigned area?
NPS RESPONSE:There is currently no water or sewer service to the Concessioner's assigned area.  The existing concessioner uses bottled water to supply the hot beverage vending machine and has access to the public restrooms directly opposite the Concession Facilities. Also see the NPS response to Question 2.

QUESTION 11
Is there a concrete pad under the vending machines?
NPS RESPONSE:At this time, there is no concrete pad under the vending machines.  The vending machines are located on a gravel surface or the blacktop paved surface contiguous with the paved road.
