<DESC>Contract Care Coordination Demonstration Industry Day Announcement To execute the requirements of Public Law 109-114, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA) Chief Business Office (CBO) is hosting an Industry Day forum to initiate partnership support with Industry and Academia to implement care management strategies that have proven valuable in the broader public and private sectors. VHA CBO’s mandated goal is to establish at least three managed care demonstration programs designed to satisfy a set of health system objectives related to arranging and managing care by the end of calendar year 2006.   To that end, VA needs to formulate demonstration objectives in collaboration with industry and academia.  To be successful in those objectives it is essential that care purchased for enrollees from private sector providers be secured in a cost effective manner, in a way that complements the larger VHA system of care, and preserves important agency interest, such as sustaining a partnership with university affiliates. As a result of that collaboration, industry partners will be given the opportunity to bid on multiple competitive awards that include the designs incorporated through public-private participation.   And Academic Partners will have the opportunity to actively participate on VA Executive Steering committees that will significantly improve health care management strategies.  The Request for Information/collaboration phase of this acquisition will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.201(b) where ”the purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and enhancing the Government’s ability to obtain quality supplies and services, including construction, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.” The Contract Care Coordination Demonstration final acquisition approach will be determined and announced after evaluation of Industry recommendations.  Known factors are that the acquisition shall have provisions to conduct at least three managed care demonstration programs designed to satisfy a set of health system objectives related to arranging and managing care, be comprehensive in scope, and serve a substantial patient population. Contract Care Coordination Industry Day will be held at Hyatt Regency Crystal City, Reagan National Airport, 2799 Jefferson Highway, Arlington, VA  22202, on ___February 2, 2006 , at _1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. EST.   Registration will begin two hours prior to the event.  Participants are encouraged to pre-register by e-mailing the names of participants and company affiliation to Donald.Monaco@va.gov .  Companies will be limited to two participants per company.  Additional seating may be available on a first come first serve basis.  Briefing packages will be given to all participants attending the briefings.  The following agenda is planned for the event: Introduction – Dr. Perlin, VA Under Secretary for Health Administration Program Overview – Mark Loper, VHA Chief Business Officer Business Logistics Acquisition Process – Leonard Nale, VHA CBO Contracting Officer.

<CONTACT>Renee Carelli, Contract Administrator, Phone +45 3341 7468, Fax +45 3526 5108, Email renee.carelli@det1.dk - Sterling Hickson, Contracting Officer, Phone +45 3341 7467, Fax +45 3526 5108, Email sterling.hickson@det1.dk
<DESC>The scope of this project requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to repair DeLong Pier at Thule Air Base Greenland.  Thule Air Base is located at Latitude N76o32’ and Longitude W68o50’, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle on the Northwest side of the island of Greenland.  The DeLong Pier was constructed circa 1950 and is a prefabricated steel structure 1,000 ft long by 50 ft wide oriented in the west-east direction. The pier consists of four steel barge units, each with overall dimensions of 250 ft long by 50 ft wide by 10 ft deep, aligned end to end. The barges are supported by two rows and twenty-four bents of steel pipe caissons. Each barge is supported by two rows of six caissons. The project work includes repair of the deteriorated northern row caissons by installation of grout filled, structural steel pile jackets to restore the original capacity of the caissons.  The steel jackets consist of steel pipe shells with bolted flanges. The structural jackets will transfer load over the severely deteriorated area of the existing steel pipe caisson. A galvanic cathodic protection system will be installed on all northern row caissons to protect against any additional corrosion losses below the waterline. A section of one of the barges that was damaged from ice will have a portion of the bottom plate replaced and all failed welds repaired.  The existing rubber tire fender system will be replaced with a conventional system foam filled fender unit system with the capacity to absorb berthing forces and properly protect the pier and berthing vessels. Due to the location of Thule Air Base, the seaport operates for 60 calendar days, typically running July through August.  Annual resupply of Thule Air Base utilizing the pier is critical and thus awardee will be required to closely coordinate construction operations with port operations in such a way that both can be carried out with as little interruption as possible.  Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift.  Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  Notice to proceed is anticipated for May 2006, with completion of the work no later than September 2006.  Actual construction is expected to take 60-90 days.Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation.  It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically on or about 17 February 2006 with offers due 30 days thereafter.  Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted.  This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4)—International Agreement, to US and Danish firms.  No hard-copies of the solicitation will be distributed.  Offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (see www.ccr.gov).

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Innovative Professional Solutions (IPS), 8317 Front Beach Road, Panama City Beach, Florida to provide engineering support for several critical combat weapon systems integral to the MCM-1 and MHC-51 Class ships.  This support includes management and repair of these combat weapon systems:  AN/SLQ-48(V) Mine Neutralization System (MNS), AN/SQQ-32(V2/V3) Sonar, OK-520 Sonar Winch, AN/SSQ-94 MIW Simulator, AN/SSN-2(V4) Navigation System, and AN/SQH-4A Battle Space Profiler System.  Accomplishment of the engineering services requires key contractor personnel be located in Ingleside, TX.  The effort identified in this order is not suitable for open competition as IPS is the only known source with personnel residing in Ingleside, TX, who have the required extensive experience with all of the MCM combat weapon systems (AN/SLQ-48(V) Mine Neutralization System (MNS), AN/SQQ-32(!  V2/V3) Sonar, OK-520 Sonar Winch, AN/SSQ-94 MIW Simulator, AN/SSN-2(V4) Navigation System, and AN/SQH-4A Battle Space Profiler System) that are to be supported on this effort.  IPS personnel possess an in-depth familiarity with the processes and procedures in place at SCRMC, pierside in Ingleside and aboard ship, all of which are instrumental to successful accomplishment of the U.S. Navy tasking.  It is estimated that obtaining any other source for this effort would increase its cost by as much as 150%.  FSC code is J020.  NAICS code is 541330.  SBA size standard is $4.0M.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The NUWC Newport intends to award a sole source Fixed Price contract to Harkness Industries, Cheshire, CT for the following items:  2 ea. Output End Mount Assembly, NAVORD Dwg. No. 3181110 and 2 ea. Input End Mount Assembly, NAVORD Dwg. 3181113.  These items are used on the MK 17 Mod 0 Turbine Pump Ejection System geartrain which provides the impulse launch capability to torpedo tubes.  The basis for the sole source is that Harkness is the original manufacturer of these items and remains the only manufacturer of the approved urethane compound used in manufacture and possesses the close tolerance molds required for the molding of the urethane to the steel plates.  To qualify another source, the Government would have to duplicate the testing already conducted on Harkness mount ring assemblies, resulting in significant additional costs and adversely impacting the ship installation schedule.  The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI6018).  This solicitation and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC05-08.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure maintenance services for the terrazzo marble floor in our BLDG. 40 facility, which is located on the National Institutes of Health campus.  This service will be required on a monthly basis.  This service is being procured on a sole source basis using Simplified Acquisition procedures, with the Stuart Dean Company.  Stuart Dean is an accredited founding member of the Marble Institute of America (MIA) and the International Association of Stone Restoration and Conservation (IASRAC).  Their processes and proprietary methods are accepted by the above, routinely outperform the competition and are of higher quality and achieve longer lasting results.  Stuart Dean is also a participatory member of the American Society of Testing Materials and is asked to test products and systems for the regulatory body.  Stuart Dean is a National Associate Member of BOMA (Building Owners and Managers Association) International.  They have provided maintenance in Bldg. 40 facility for the past 4 Years.  This is not a small business Set-Aside.  The requirement consists of the following: 1) monthly maintenance of over 4,200 square feet of terrazzo marble in 1st floor public area: 2) elevator lobby; 3) steps leading to North rotunda entrance; 4) landing at base of stairs; 5) areas to be refinished will be completely masked and covered with protective paper and plastic to ensure integrity of delicate finishes adjacent to marble, such as bronze and wood; 6) all light to medium scratches will be removed using abrasive means including resin-bonded diamond pads and sand screens in conjunction with a weighted floor machine; 7) a powdered mixture of oxalic acid, aluminum oxide and water will be used as a polishing compound under a 19” natural fiber-polishing pad; 8) once even polished is achieved, all polishing slurry will be removed by use of a water vacuum, followed by a two-step neutralizing process achieved by flooding the polished area with ph balanced stone soap; 9) vitrification or crystallization of marble will be performed to improve the floors, slip co-efficient and enhance the hardness of shine, per manufacturer’s specifications utilizing specially low-rotation floor machine and #2 Texsteel steel wool pads.  The scope of the work is to restore the luster and sheen of the floor material by adherence to methodology developed by the Marble Institute of America and the International Association of Stone Restoration and Conservation.  Workers skilled in vitrification process are a mandatory requirement.  Depending on the extent of the wear, the requirements might include polishing with abrasive compounds and vitrification of the surface.  It is critical that the thickness of the marble be minimized as the marble is ground during the polishing process.  The marble is only a fraction of an inch thick, and serious repercussions could arise regarding the longevity of the floor.  It is critical that only an experienced, high-quality firm perform this work.  The Period of Performance will be January 2006 – December 2006.  The North American Industry Classification System Code Number 238990 and the Small business Set-Aside is 12.0 million.  The FOB point shall be Destination.  This will be a firm-fixed price contract.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulations provisions and clauses apply to the acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; Far 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certifications Commercial Items; Far 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; Far 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; and FAR 52.406-7 Central Contractor Registration (2003).  A completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representation and Certifications Commercial Items must be included which can be found at Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) https://orca.bpn.gov.  (B) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.  The CCR website is http://www/ccr.dlis.dlaimil.  Copies of the aforementioned clauses are available upon request by telephone to James Kish at (301) 402-2282.  All responsible sources may submit offers that will be considered by this agency.  Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST), February 2, 2006.  For delivery through the U.S. Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Road, Room 2NE52F, Bethesda, MD, 20817-4811.  Electronic transmission will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Office of Federal Detention Trustee plans to solicit proposals from Small Business for the following requirement:

In September 2001, Congress directed the creation of the Office of Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) in response to growing concerns regarding the management of persons in federal detention.  Congress charged OFDT with the responsibility to provide for the safe, secure, and humane confinement of persons in federal custody awaiting trial or immigration proceedings.  To satisfy this mission, OFDT relies heavily on IT solutions that support targeted efficiencies in detention management.  OFDT seeks IT solutions that are cost effective, operations centric, leverage legacy systems when needed, and integrate knowledge sharing amongst participating detention agencies. 

In pursuit of its mission, OFDT recently introduced eDesignate.  eDesignate is a system that automates the designation process (i.e., that process that results in sentenced individuals being “designated” to a facility in which they will serve their sentence).  Currently OFDT has a robust production environment to support eDesignate.  

OFDT envisions eDesignate and related infrastructure to evolve into a more comprehensive IT system that will provide cross-organizational automation to several OFDT functions.  It is the desire of OFDT to eventually reach maturity with its infrastructure such that there are separate environments for testing, development, training, and production.   However, OFDT is constrained by current resource limitations that require it to first provide one environment  that meets all of these needs.

OFDT has identified a need to establish a development, testing, and training suite that meets OFDT’s current evaluation criteria.  

This project represents the logical maturation of OFDT system-of-systems that will, when fully realized, provide cross-organizational automation to several OFDT functions.  As previously stated, it is the desire of OFDT to eventually reach maturity with its infrastructure such that there are separate environments for testing, development, training and production. However, OFDT is constrained by current resource limitations that require it to first provide one environment that meets all of these needs. Because of future extensibility needs, the nature of this development/testing/training environment shall be such that OFDT can easily evolve it to separate environments.

Lockheed Martin Systems Integration is the designer, developer and manufacturer of the software used in the MDLT and is, therefore, the only source that possesses the indepth technical knowledge and the technical data rights necessary to provide these services within the time required to meet Canadian FMS requirements.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Tara-Shea Newsome, 703-692-9425
<DESC>On behalf of the Department of the Army Community and Family Support Center and in accordance with FAR 6.3, the Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE) intends to execute a commercial contract under other than full and open competition on a sole sourc e basis to DefenseWeb Technologies Inc. (DefenseWeb), a small business. The Government requires this task order provides for on-going support and maintenance of the existing Army Virtual Family Readiness Group (vFRG) web system.  The objective of the vFRG system is to provide all of the functionality of traditional FRGs in an ad-hoc and online setting.  The vFRG system supports online FRGs at the Brigade, Battalion, and Company levels.  The vFRG system may correspond logically to an existing, traditional FR G, but also supports the creation of ad-hoc FRGs due to the dispersion of family members and volunteer FRG leaders across the US and the world, with no unit-integrity of those families.  Furthermore, the vFRG system provides support not only to the spouses , families, and parents of married soldiers, but shall also be able to include support for parents, families and significant others of single soldiers.  The Government intends to continue DefenseWebs ongoing effort from a previously expired contract.  The  Government anticipates a full and open competition award for future fulfillment of this requirement.    This notice is valid until 25 January 2006 and is NOT a request for proposals.  Performance period is twelve months from the contract award date. This announcement is for informational purposes only. No RFP will be available for competitive proposals. The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any technical information provided.   A determination by the Government not  to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Award is anticipated on or about 31 January 2006.  Interested firms may submit capability statements to Tara-Shea.Newsome@hqda.army.mil.  T elephone requests will not be accepted.

<RESPDATE>012506
<CONTACT>Sheneil R Green, 202-493-4282
<DESC>AMENDMENT 0002 On January 6 and 10, the agency published answers to the following two questions: Q:  At this stage we are aware that JPDO IPT's are in the process of developing weather, communications, security strategies and architecture for the end NGATS solution.  We are planning on competing for such things as SWIM, communications modernization, network security solutions, weather applications, etc. that are anticipated as outcomes of the design work that is being done through the JPDO.  If we participate in this contract, can we then actually compete for the end solution efforts without being subject to Organizational Conflict of Interest clauses because we were a part of the technical assistance process envisioned in your procurement or is your procurement the actual end solution? Q:  With respect to the JPDO's response to the previous question relative to Organizational Conflict of Interest (below), we are proceeding on the assumption that a subcontractor to a NGATS prime contractor would be allowed to bid on future solution elements of the NGATS provided that such subcontractor does not accept any tasks from the prime contractor that directly relate to the solution element for which the subcontractor intends to submit a bid. Upon further deliberation and review of industry comments to those answers, the agency has reconsidered this issue and publishes the following as the answer to those questions: Offerors are encouraged to submit Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plans, pursuant to AMS Clause 3.1.7-3, Organizational Conflict if Interest SIR Provision (August 1997).  These plans will not be evaluated but will be reviewed and commented upon during submission evaluation and contract administration.  Given all possible outcomes from any of the activities contemplated under this statement of work, it is impossible for the FAA to determine at this time the means by which any future requirements will be met.  As such, the FAA is unable at this time to definitively determine that the successful offeror will be excluded from competing on specific future procurements arising out of these activities. Amendment 0002 is issued and the close date is EXTENDED to Wednesday, February 1, 2006.  Please review the amendment and the solicitation in its entirety. If there are any questions, comments or concerns regarding this matter, please contact Contract Specialist, Sheneil R. Green, at sheneil.green@faa.gov no later than 2PM, Wednesday, January 25, 2006. AMENDMENT 0001 ANNOUNCEMENT: Based on a recent internal meeting outcome, the FAA wants to ensure it is being consistent with the message it conveyed in earlier communication on the issue of teaming for the JPDO TAC requirement, i.e., to encourage teaming.  Therefore, we are amending the solicitation to allow for the inclusion of subcontractor's past performance history and experience to be evaluated as part of a prime offeror's proposal submission. Amendment 0001 outlines the pertinent changes to the solicitation.  The amendment does not change the date of offeror submission which remains as Wednesday, January 25, 2006 by 2:00PM EST.  If there are any questions, comments or concerns regarding this matter, please contact Contract Specialist, Sheneil R. Green, at sheneil.green@faa.gov no later than 2PM, Wednesday, January 18, 2006. ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) requires technical support services to assist in the planning, research, development, engineering, implementation, and establishment of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). The JPDO is spearheading the mission to build and implement the NGATS.  This system will enhance the technologies, processes, and methodologies employed in the current system and respond to market and regulatory forces that shape the air transportation environment over the next twenty years.   To accomplish this mission, the JPDO is charged with forming and serving as the system integrator of a collaborative enterprise.  The enterprise is to combine efforts of six agency partners and draw on the insights and expertise of industry and the aviation community to build a target 2025 system. In December 2004, the JPDO issued the Integrated Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. To obtain further information on the Joint Planning and Development Office and the Next Generation Air Transportation System visit www.jpdo.aero. The FAA anticipates the award of Technical Assistance Contract of the Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type with fully loaded fixed hourly labor rates, with a period of performance of one year from the date of award and four one-year options, for a total of five years. Any questions and/or concerns regarding this solicitation shall be directed to the Contract Specialist no later than 2PM on January 18 in order to receive timely FAA feedback. Sheneil R. Green, Contract Specialist Email: sheneil.green@faa.gov The offeror's submission in response to the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer is due no later than Wednesday, January 25, 2006 by 2:00PM via mail or hand delivery.

<DESC>Amendment 3 to Solicitation FA8601-05-R-0082 This solicitation is hereby cancelled due to a revision of the  specifications.  A new solicitation will be issued under FA8601-05-R-0023  in the near future.

The email filters at  Wright-Patterson are designed to filter emails without subject lines or  with suspicious subject lines. ******************************************* Amendment 2 to Solicitation FA8601-05-R-0082 1.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide additional clarification  on the chamber size.  Questions arose after Amendment 1 was posted to  prompt this amendment. Question One: Overall dimensions only are addressed in the PWS, not the chamber size.  It's critical to know the chamber size.  Since the workspace of the shroud  is 36", would the minimum size 42" be required?  Or do you have another  size dimension requirement for the chamber?  In other words, what exactly  is the dimension requirement “size” of the chamber?  Will 42” suffice?  What would you like to have in the chamber size diameter? Answer: The minimum working space will be a Diameter of 36" with a depth of 36"  with the shroud in place.  The maximum is 42” (note: must fit through the  doors and hallway - see drawing attached to annoucement under "Revised  Drawing"). Question Two: How many copies of the materials need to be submitted with the price  quote? Answer: Vendors shall submit at least one copy of the complete quotation package,  including price quote, technical capability information (if not previously  submitted) along with the Representations and Certifications document. Question Three: Can the materials/quotation be hand delivered? Answer: Due to increased security base access is limited.  Therefore to eliminate  problems which may arise for hand delivery of quotation packages,  recommend one of the following methods for quotation submittal:  Quotations may be faxed, with coversheet, to Ms. Jacque Davis,  937-656-1412, electronically submitted via email to  Jacqueline.Davis@wpafb.af.mil, or mailed to Ms Jacque Davis, 88 CONS/PKB,  1940 Allbrook Drive, Suite 3, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-5309. Question Four: Can I send an executable (.exe)  or a zip (.zip) file through the email  system containing my quotation? Answer: The servers at Wright-Patterson do not allow receipt of executable (.exe)  or zip (.zip) files.  However, Word documents (.doc), or .pdf files are  acceptable. 2.  As a result of the request for additional clarification, the closing  date is hereby changed to Tuesday, 11:30 a.m. (EDT) on 22 November 2005.  Prospective bidders are reminded that complete quotation packages,  including price quote, technical capability information (if not previously  submitted) and Representations and Certifications shall be submitted by  Tuesday, 11:30 a.m. (EDT) on 22 November 2005, to Ms Jacque Davis, 88  CONS/PKB, 1940 Allbrook Drive, Suite 3, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433-5309. *********************************** Amendment 1 to Solicitation FA8601-05-R-0082 The purpose of this amendment is to revise the drawing originally posted  with the solicitation.

The approximate time period following submission of a product for qualification testing within which the applicant will be notified whether the product passed or failed the qualification testing is currently estimated to be 90 days.  When a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin.  Once a contractor becomes qualified, The Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, will notify NAVICP.  At that point the newly qualified f!  irm will be included on the mailing list of the SHT Tile solicitation and will be considered for possible contract award.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest is extending the current 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) from 25 April 2006 to 24 April 2007 and is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, California and Phoenix, Arizona) to participate in this BOA program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to three additional years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement.  Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.  Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts.  The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).  Only NAICS code sectors 236, 237 and 238 are eligible to participate on this BOA.  Each firm will identify their primary NAICS and a secondary NAICS (if applicable).  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, however there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 per firm over the life of the agreement.  Individual task orders will range between $2,000 and $500,000.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.  Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  The Contracting Officer will open /advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year.  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly.  No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate.  Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued.  The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.  This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party.  Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.  Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA.  Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA.  Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible.  To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) developmental stage participant (Joint Venture/Mentor Protege firms are not allowed) prior to the submission date of 09 March 2006; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, CA and Phoenix, AZ); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://www.bpn.gov; and VETS-100 http://vets100.cudenver.edu/ (if not applicable, provide statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,000 - $500,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS sectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.  TO BE CONSIDERED, INTERESTED FIRMS MUST DOWNLOAD AND USE THE CHECKLIST FROM THIS WEBSITE TO ENSURE ALL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED.  Please submit your package to NAVFAC Southwest, Attn: Dale English, Code RAQ20.DE, 1220 Pacific Highway, Building 127, San Diego, CA 92132, or via e-mail to dale.english@navy.mil not later than 2:00 PM Pacific Time Zone on 09 March 2006.

<DESC>THIS IS A MODIFICATION TO THE SYNOPSIS POSTED ON 28 DECEMBER 2005.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE) intends to procure a mobile landbased Heavy Maintenance Crane (HMC).  The government plans to replace the existing 8 ½ ton wheel-mounted maintenance cranes, Navy designation A/S32M-14 and A/S32M-17 with the new HMC.  The current Fleet shorebased cranes support the following aircraft systems:  AV-8, C-130, CH-53, V-22, E-6, P-3 and H-46.  They are used for aircraft maintenance and component removal and replacement (engines, transmissions, propellers, rotor blades, etc.).  The following are some of the requirements for the new mobile landbased HMC:  The new HMC shall be a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)  or a modified COTS item.  It shall adhere to national standards as documented in ASME B30.5-2000, utilize state-of-the-art technology, and be transportable in military aircraft (C-5, C-17).  The COTS HMC shall have the following minimum lift capacity: 12,000 lbs at an outreach of not less than 13 ft clear from the frame of the crane (not center of rotation) with a hook height of not less than 26 ft.  The new HMC shall have a telescopic boom, be wheel-mounted with 2 and 4 Wheel Drive and 4 Wheel Steer capability, and weigh less than or equal to 45,000 lbs.  As required for any typical Navy Support Equipment (SE), the new HMC shall be highly reliable, maintainable, and supportable.   The new HMC shall be capable of meeting environmental, EMI, mobility requirements, and 3600 swing (slewing/rotating) criteria.  Human factors engineering shall be utilized to the greatest extent possible to make the new HMC a “user friendly” piece of SE.   IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE CONTRACT WILL BE FIRM-FIXED PRICE, AND THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO PROCURE 2 PILOT PRODUCTION UNITS AND ASSOCIATED TECHNICAL AND LOGISTICS DATA AND TRAINING AS PART OF THE BASIC QUANTITY.  THE PILOT PRODUCTION UNITS ARE TO BE USED FOR PRE-PRODUCTION TESTING AND GOVERNMENT SUITABILITY AND SUPPORTABILITY EVALUATION/APPROVAL TESTING.  THERE WILL BE THREE ONE YEAR OPTION PERIODS FOR A TOTAL OF 75 PRODUCTION UNITS.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil. Select ‘Doing Business’ and then ‘Open Solicitations.’ Look for amendments on the web page. Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors. The solicitation will be posted on the web on or about 09 FEBRUARY 2006. The Government will NOT accept electronic offers.

<CONTACT>Helene Braun, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email braunh@ninds.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has a requirement to accelerate neuroprotective therapeutics development for Parkinson’s Disease (PD).  PD is the second most commonly occurring neurodegenerative disease, hallmarked by the gradual loss of dopaminergic and other neurons, as well as the accumulation of insoluble aggregates.  Therefore, a primary goal is to find rational treatments which can prevent progression of the disease once diagnosed or prevent neurons from dying in individuals at risk for developing  the disease.  In 2001, the NINDS established the Committee to Identify Neuroprotective Agents for Parkinson’s (CINAPS). CINAPS is the process whereby neuroprotective drugs and doses are selected for the Neuroprotection Exploratory Trials in Parkinson’s disease (NET-PD), which are ongoing. CINAPS has developed an evidence-based approach, which uses the published literature to select promising drugs for Parkinson’s clinical trials. This process was well received and the CINAPS results were published (Neurology 60(8):1234-40, 2003). The approach has been adopted for use by the HD and ALS research communities, at their request. While the CINAPS process is sound, the main limitation is the quality and thoroughness of the preclinical animal testing data found in the literature. When planning trials, there is often insufficient information in the published preclinical literature. The models chosen, route of administration, dose and other features may not fully answer some of the questions needed for bringing drugs into clinical trials, or there may simply be no replication of the study results demonstrating efficacy in a particular model.  Therefore, NINDS has identified a need to establish a contract facility that would provide resources and capabilities to help select the most promising drugs for PD clinical trials.  Some of the tasks involved in this project are:  1) efficacy studies; 2) toxicity studies; 3) PD Animal Model standardization; 4) CINAPS research logistics; and 5) quality control.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5) years beginning September, 2006.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-06-02 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address:  (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to number note 26.*****

Answer  #2:  There is no spectral range requirement.   To reduce cost, the EPA will use an existing cold  filtered High D* InSb detector optimized for formaldehyde detection in the 2800 cm-1 region.   Question #3:  Can we get a short extension for our response? Answer  #3:   No, a time extension is not approved.  Due date for quotes is 01/19/06 at 3:00PM (EST) Long-path 78 m extractive-cell Fourier  Transform InfraRed (FTIR) System This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Fully  automated control, acquisition, and analysis software. 1.4. All necessary equipment for long-term ambient air sampling for the purpose of automated formaldehyde quantification. Note: An existing EPA 32 m heated extractive FTIR optical cell may be used for rebuild components or as a trade-in to  reduce the cost of the system.  An existing EPA InSb detector may also be utilized to reduce the cost of the system.  In lieu of using existing EPA components, a contractor's used system is also acceptable, if it meets the specifications stated above. Acceptance Test: The contractor shall verify  the performance of the instrument for detection of formaldehyde at sub part per billion levels in ambient air, and generate a performance report.

NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions  received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July  2005.  ************************************************************* Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14  Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library. ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun  05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the  submittal of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday  June 17th will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions  were asked about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following  infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple  Functions QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past  performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR  requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would  it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate  attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments  that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common  or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC,  however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will  be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one  page cover page that may contain business information and details like  business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards  the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be  acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is  acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low  band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia  Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt  of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14  June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to industry via  PIXS, or via a CD and when?

Stripping - 145 cy (most from crest of the dam, rest for access road) 3.  Clear and grub the Downstream slope of the dam 4.  Embankment excavation - 230 cy 5.  Remove 26 trees and stumps from the D/S side of the dam and within 10' of the toe of the dam 6.  Fill 610 cy     a.  Raise dam 3'    b.  Fill in holes on the D/S side of the dam  7.  Remove, to the extent funding permits, 6000 cy of reservoir sediments (amount depends on unit price as funding is limited) 8.  Furnish and install new slide gate (for a 30" dia RCP) 9.  Furnish and install new trashrack panels - estimated weight = 2,700 lb Also, there will be removal of water (to facilitate installing new slide gate and trashrack panels) and diversion and care of stream during construction.  (NOTE: this is not an underwater operation) Reservoir sediments are expected to be very saturated, high in fine content and little sandy material.  Conditions may be very similar to what was encountered at Camp 5 Dam where Contractor had difficulty in removing the sediments. Dam is about 13' high and has a crest length of about 150'.  Built in about 1933, located within Prince William Forest Park and is located about 40 miles south of Washington DC.  I-95 along the east boundary of the Park. If you are SERIOUSLY interested in seeing the specifications and drawings for this work when they come out (approximately within the next 30-days) please contact Bill Holbert with the Bureau of Reclamation at the following email address:  bholbert@do.usbr.gov

The Air Force is in the process of preparing a Justification and Approval document to gain the required approval to issue a sole source request for proposal to General Dynamics.   Suitable technical data, government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application.  Data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in the Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.  

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), Justification:  Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  

Subject to the Government’s consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite services, should submit a concise and program specific response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that they have (1) the necessary knowledge and understanding  of the requirements; 2) employees with satisfactory qualifications; and 3) appropriate repair knowledge and experience to be able to provide the services required without technical, schedule or cost risk to the ICBM and/or similar ICBM programs prior to contract award.     

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>83--Improved Sleeping System to replace current issued Modular Sleep System (MSS).
<SOLNBR>M6785406I3008
<RESPDATE>020806
<CONTACT>Wendy Stevenson, contracts specialist, phone 703-432-3267, fax 703-432-3262, email:  wendy.stevenson@usmc.mil. Dorinne Rivoal, supervisory contracting officer, 703-432-3274.
<DESC>Description: The Marine Corps is requesting information from industry regarding an Improved Sleeping System (ISS) to replace the current issued Modular Sleep System (MSS).  The MSS consists of three components: a patrol bag for temperatures between 30oF and 50oF; an intermediate cold bag for temperatures between 30oF and –10oF; and a bivy bag for moisture protection. The patrol bag and intermediate cold bag combined provide insulation to -30oF.  Both insulating bags (either independently or together) are compatible with the bivy bag.  MSS system weighs 10.3 LBS, and has a packed volume of 1.03 CuFt.   Of great interest is information regarding reduction of the packed volume and weight while maintaining (or improving) other salient characteristics of our current MSS.     Desired characteristics:  The ISS in its packed configuration will be smaller than the current MSS that has a packed volume of 1.03 CuFt.  The volume reduction threshold and objective are one-third reduction and one-half reduction respectively.  Volume reduction may be achieved through mechanical means, changes in materials or a combination of the two.  (Threshold: .68 CuFt, Objective: .52 CuFt)    The ISS will achieve a total weight reduction of at least one-quarter and preferably one-third the current MSS system weight of 10.3. Weight reduction may be achieved through configuration design, change in materials or a combination of the both. (Threshold: 7.73 Lbs, Objective: 6.8 Lbs)    Consideration will be given to designs that incorporate the functions and features of a permanent or removable ground insulating pad into the ISS and thereby reducing the total weight by emanating the need for a separate ground-insulating pad. All other salient characteristics must be equal to or better than the current MSS system as defined in the attached commercial item description for the MSS (A-A-55262).  Other improvements (such as, but not limited to, decreased drying time) are also desired; however, they are considered secondary to decreasing the volume and weight. BERRY AMENDMENT.  This sources sought is subject to the Berry Amendment, 10 USC 2533a.  Vendors who believe they have a product(s) capable of meeting this requirement are requested to provide product literature, brochures, price lists, warranty coverage, business size and any other relevant information.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Aeromedical Evacuation Electrical Power Source

The Human Systems Group is seeking information from sources that are capable of providing an Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Electrical Power Source to eliminate dependence on aircraft power.  The electrical power source must be able to be used within the aeromedical evacuation system.

The electrical power source should have as a minimum the following capabilities:

1. 	The volume of the electrical power source must enable the device to fit on the Air Force’s Patient Support Pallet with the patients.  Free space is at a premium.    

2.	The product’s overall weight should be minimized.  Responders should specify whether their device provides power to each individual patient or serves multiple patients simultaneously. 

3.	   The electrical power source should provide 7.5 amps of electricity per patient for the duration of a 12 hour mission.  AE medical equipment typically operates on 12 VDC; however some equipment uses 120 VAC only, so the power source should be capable of delivering both AC and DC.  Responders should specify whether the devices require refueling/recharging/replacing to achieve the above requirements.  Electrical power within the product should be renewable either by the addition of new fuel or by recharging.

4.	The electrical power source will operate in an atmosphere where there may be jet fuel vapor present.  The product must not spark for any reason and must not use high volumes of potentially explosive fuel.  It must not produce noxious exhaust products.

5.  	The electrical power source will operate in aircraft at altitude. During an in-flight rapid decompression the expansion in air volume will not diminish the electrical generation capacity of the product. The product will be tested by the USAF in a high altitude chamber to 15,000 feet above sea level. The product will be subjected to a rapid decompression to 45,000 feet above sea level.  (See URL:  http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_500.4 ) 

6.   	The product will withstand exposure to humidity levels from 5% to 95%.

7.  	The product shall recover after being subjected to high temperature storage IAW MIL-STD-810F, Method 501.4.  (See URL:  http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_501.4 )

8. 	The product shall recover after being subjected to low temperature storage IAW MIL-STD-810F, Method 502.4.  (See URL: http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_502.4 )

9.	The product shall meet all applicable OSHA standards for safety and EPA standards for disposal.

<DESC>This is a request for information to help the National Institute of Standards and Technology identify potential firms and capabilities to provide a Big Wall Visualization System for the National Institute of Standards and Technology Manufacturing Systems and Integration Division (MSID).  MSID was established to contribute to the research and development of data standards, generic interfaces and technologies leading to the implementation of modeling and simulation for emergency response for first responders, training and simulation systems, virtual manufacturing enterprises and supply chain management systems. 

As part of its efforts, MSID has been working on the development of a Virtual Manufacturing Enterprise (VME) with implementation of a big wall visualization system prototype for integrated manufacturing simulation and gaming for emergency response planning and training systems. The interoperability of simulation and gaming tools for emergency response can help achieve a valuable capability for planning, training and post-incident response.  The initial demonstration of this prototype is focusing on modeling and demonstrating a dirty bomb scenario in Washington DC or a global supply chain scenario with potential multiple suppliers and collaborators located in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.

MSID has partners in government agencies, industry end-users, software vendors and with diverse interests such as: training and simulation systems, modeling and simulation for public safety, emergency response and homeland security, cloud simulation, plume simulation, intelligent operators, game technology, manufacturing simulation such as steel fabrication, electromechanical production, semiconductor, die casting, injection molding, machining, automotive and aerospace assembly, inspection, human operator modeling, ergonomics analysis, supply chain, discrete event models, and graphical representations.

The big wall display would most likely be partition into multiple segments for potentially multiple applications. Multiple video streams and data will be accessed, linked, and displayed on the big wall displays for use by teams of project management, program management, and command, control and communication organization.

Preliminary systems specifications:

The system should be able to display in High Definition and fill out most of the area dedicated to it (HD resolution: 1920x1080). The wall size is about 16 feet wide and 8 feet tall. Ideally, the projection would start a foot off the ground and would go up to the ceiling. A widescreen (16:9) format is desirable. The image is to be rear projected to allow presenters to walk in front of it without masking the projected image or being blinded by the projected light. The screen is to be rigid (solid) to permit hand gesture control such as, but not limited to: window manipulations, chroma keying of a chosen color, and multi-source control capability. The brightness has to be high enough to allow the conference room lights to be turned on. The light has to homogeneously cover the projected area avoiding blinding spots (smooth and continuous brightness). A high contrast level is necessary to accurately display videos as well as 2 and 3-Dimensional virtual applications. No stereovision technology needed.

The projector should be network enabled (wired and/or wireless).

Major specs: 

HD at least 1920x1080.   
16:9 aspect ratio.   
Single, dual, multiple, or tiered projectors, objective for this spec is to reduce the system failure probability and to reduce initial and/or maintenance costs.  
Rear projected.  
Solid single piece screen (Glass or Plexiglas but thick enough not to bend).  
Homogeneous light dispersion over the projected area
High level of brightness and contrast (3,000+ lumens, 1,000+ contrast ratio).  
Networked for displaying remote computers.  
Compatible with existing source display management hardware (Creston) is preferred.  
Compatibility with Unix systems is preferable.  

Vendors who believe they have a product(s) capable of meeting this requirement are requested to provide product literature, brochures, warranty coverage, and price list(s).  Price list(s) shall clearly indicate the estimated price of the system(s) components i.e. total labor, frame, mirror, projector cost, the screen cost and the maintenance.

Vendors shall provide the Government with the following information: (1) Name of Company-include a contact person’s name, telephone number and email address; (2) Company Address; (3) Company Size (please specify as either-Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), Hubzone Small Business) or other and indicate whether a large business or small business under NAICS 334310; (4) Address whether the capabilities identified in the requirement described above are of a type offered and sold competitively in the commercial marketplace based on market prices or whether these services are exclusively provided to the Government; (5) If commercially available, identify standard commercial terms and conditions typically associated with these services; (6) Describe experience and past performance with similar types of requirements of similar scope and magnitude and whether they were performed performance-based and include the contract number, Government agency name and address and contract funded amount; (7) Product literature and pricing structure as previously described.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND A CONTRACT WILL NOT BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  Information should be submitted (two copies are requested) by 1:00 PM EST on January 24, 2006 to US Department of Commerce, National Institute of Science and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899, to the attention of Deborah Rincon.  Because of heightened security, Fed-Ex, UPS or similar delivery methods are preferred method of delivery of proposals.  FAXED, EMAILED AND HAND DELIVERED SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

Description Analysis and reporting of small magnitude seismic events continues to be one of the most important tasks for the United States National Data Center (USNDC) and the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC).  The operational software system used for analyzing and reporting events in the USNDC is not sufficiently flexible to allow the quick introduction of numerous advanced data processing techniques and the use of various cutting-edge information-presentation technologies.  Lessons learned from several previous special events show that a few key software programs used by the Research Division (TTR) geophysicist are most useful for detailed analyses of small events, and that a user-friendly interface to a specialized reporting database would streamline AFTAC' s reporting process.  The first objective of this project is to build a suite of software for the analysis and evaluation of geophysical events.  Many of the desired analysis and evaluation techniques have already been incorporated into a research software suite known as Special Event Analysis Tools (SEAtools), developed for the TTR under previous contracts.  This software suite shall be the starting point for this effort.  As part of this effort, new analysis techniques shall be added as they are identified.  In addition, the Contractor shall help identify which portions of SEAtools will eventually have to be "operationalized" in the sense of streamlining and configuring it for optimal routine use with vetted operational settings and previously user-specified input parameters.  In addition to the development of new functionality, included under this objective is the evaluation of Government Off-the Shelf (GOTS) and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) algorithms/techniques, as applicable, for the improvement of geophysical data processing capabilities.  The second objective is to continue the development and maintenance of an event reporting tool that will extract information from AFTAC databases, and use such information to generate graphic and alphanumeric event summaries for presentation to AFTAC's various customers via a web-page hosted on a classified internet Wide-Area-Network.  The third objective is to provide for installation of the SARC software suite at seismic array stations around the world for use in analyzing and evaluating geophysical events. The fourth objective is to provide for maintenance of the software suite.  The contractor shall be responsible for traveling to foreign seismic array stations to install the SARC software and to train the host-country personnel how to use the software.  Contractor personnel will require DoD security clearances at least at the TOP SECRET/SCI level for key personnel.  Handling of material up to a TOP SECRET/SCI is required.  TOP SECRET Facility Clearance is required.  Storage Clearances of at least the SECRET level are required.  The contractor shall possess an in-depth understanding of the requirements listed above.  Ideal contractor candidates must have personnel with knowledge of Seismic Analysis and Reporting Capabilities (SARC) to research and develop software for geophysical data processing.  Contractor experience and past performance are critical to a successful and uninterrupted SARC mission; therefore, a history of relevant work is required.  Experience in assessment and development of concept requirements and operational documentation is required.  Also, experience in performing software validation and testing in above AFTAC/TT mission area outlined above is required.  Capabilities Package This sources sought synopsis is an invitation for all qualified small business sources that contemplate submitting a proposal under a future RFP for this requirement to identify themselves.  Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice.  Responses must be limited to no more than 20 pages and should address the following specific areas: 1. The clearance level of personnel working on the proposed contract; 2. The capabilities of key personnel relating to the requirements outlined above.  Resumes may be included but shall be counted as part of the above page limit. 3. Recent and Relevant company experience and capabilities related to the requirements outlined above. 4. Business size/status.  The government intends to make a single award and trade off performance over price.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract is contemplated with a 1-year base period and 4 one-year options (1 Oct 2006 - 30 Sep 2011).

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for a Mars Aerial Platform Scout Mission (Mars) - NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, non-profit organizations, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate in developing a proposal addressing the goals and objectives for a NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the Mars Scout 2006 and Mission of Opportunity. Mars Scout missions are envisioned to be focused investigations of Martian biological, chemical and physical phenomena and processes. The Mars Scout mission opportunity was established to provide for innovative, rapid-response investigations. Mars Scout investigations are led by a Principal Investigator supported by Co-Investigators and an implementation team. These teams will pursue missions of high scientific value by utilizing observation platforms of their choice and design. The observation platform selected for use by the LaRC team is an aerial platform. The Mars Scout AO is expected to be released in April 2006 with the step-1 proposal due 90 days later. Multiple complete mission proposals will be selected to proceed to step-2 (Phase A), with a single mission selected for implementation. A launch date in 2011 is planned.   LaRC is seeking partners in the following three mission areas for the full mission proposal; (1) design and development of the planetary entry system, (2) design and development of the liquid rocket propulsion subsystem for the aerial platform, and (3) design and development of the telecommunications subsystem for the aerial platform.  It is noted that a previous teaming opportunity (SS-NNL05MARS) for Mars Aerial Platform Scout Mission was issued March 29, 2005, seeking partners in other mission areas (1) design and development of the science instrumentation, and (2) education and public outreach.  That opportunity has closed. Key attributes of the baseline concept for each area are noted below. These attributes are provided as a guide to the Offerors, however, the final system design submitted for the Mars Scout proposal will be developed in partnership between the selected Offeror(s) and LaRC. All responses above should have demonstrated space heritage. While each of the systems (planetary entry system, propulsion subsystem, and telecommunications subsystem) are comprised of multiple elements, it is the intention of the Government to solicit an industry partner to serve as the provider and integrator of each of the (sub)systems in lieu of specific component providers.  Key attributes of the baseline planetary entry system consist of using a 2.65 meter external diameter aeroshell with a biconic backshell. A supersonic parachute is used for additional deceleration of the aeroshell. The aerial platform is extracted from the backshell during the descent phase and subsequently released.  Key attributes of the liquid rocket propulsion subsystem for the aerial platform include using a bi-propellant consisting of monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (MON-3).  The baseline total thrust range necessary is between 50 Newtons to 95 Newtons.  Key attributes of the telecommunications subsystem for the aerial platform is the use of the UHF band. The baseline system features include the ability to transmit at different data rates with a maximum radiated power of 40 watts and receive at a maximum rate of 8 kilo-bits per second.  Teaming offers will be reviewed, evaluated, and selected at NASA LaRC. If selected through this synopsis, each partner is expected to become a full member of the technical assessment, proposal development, and mission implementation team. LaRC will require each selected partner to provide a letter of commitment. LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the providers of the planetary entry system, the propulsion subsystem, and the telecommunications subsystem, provided the mission concept is selected for implementation.  Interested parties may propose as a partner for any, all, or any combination of the areas sought. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant Experience and Past Performance: This criterion evaluates the offeror’s relevant technical experience and past performance in similar development activities. Provide a description of relevant technical experience including a summary of significant achievements and technical performance. Offeror shall specifically discuss the relevance of their experience in reference to the design and development of planetary entry systems, liquid rocket systems, and/or UHF telecommunications systems.  (2) Cost and schedule control:	This criterion evaluates the offeror’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The offeror should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Technical Capability, Key Personnel and Facilities: This criterion evaluates the offeror’s technical capability to perform the development proposed, the availability and adequacy of key personnel, and the availability and adequacy of facilities. The offeror shall describe the technical capability, facilities and key personnel available to support the proposal and mission development. NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparation costs incurred by team members.  It is expected that the teaming organizations will participate actively in the proposal process and that selection of the proposal for mission implementation would result in contract(s) for the selected partners. This synopsis teaming opportunity does not represent a guarantee to selection of award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA), conceptual designs, technical data, proposal inputs, schedule and cost estimates consistent with the NASA Scout guidelines as described in the AO.  Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages for each mission area of interest (i. e., Offerors responding to one or more of the three elements may submit up to 5 pages per element). Responses shall address each of the aforementioned evaluation criteria. A cover page that clearly identifies the area of interest addressed by the response does not count towards the total allocated page count. All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically via e-mail by 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on 13 February, 2006 to: e-mail:  h.s.wright@larc.nasa.gov; Name:  Henry Wright Technical and Programmatic questions should be directed to: Henry Wright at (757)864-6928 or e-mail: h.s.wright@larc.nasa.gov Procurement questions should be directed to: Nancy Sessoms at (757) 864-2471 or e-mail: Nancy.M.Sessoms@nasa.gov

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for a Parachute System for Terrain Guided Automatic Landing Demonstration (TGALS) - NASA Langley Research Center is seeking a partner for the Space Technology-9 (ST9) TGALS.  The partner to be selected by this Teaming Opportunity will, at no cost to NASA, help to further define the ST9 TGALS parachute system during the ST9 Concept Definition Study Phase.  The proposed TGALS mission is one of five different New Millennium Program (NMP) ST9 missions being considered for implementation.  The NASA Research Announcement (NRA) Number NNH04ZSS002N, (available for viewing at URL http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/nra/current/NNH04ZSS002N/ )	 released August 25, 2004, describes the ST9 TGALS objectives in more detail, as well as those for the other four missions under consideration. Specifically, LaRC is seeking a partner with capabilities to design and fabricate the parachutes for the terrain guided descent vehicle.  During the Concept Definition phase, the selected partner is expected to provide preliminary analysis and trade studies, conceptual designs, developmental test plans, schedules, and cost estimates.  The parachute system is planned to be a two-stage parachute system.  The initial parachute will be a supersonic drogue chute to decelerate the payload to about 70 m/s at 10 km.  The main parachute will be a guided parachute that limits Earth impact rate to 10 m/s.  The guided parachute control system will incorporate target selection from NASA’s terrain guided landing systems and provide closed loop control to the designated landing target.  The NMP ST9 Concept Definition Report developed during Phase A Concept Definition is due September 1, 2006.  One of the five technology concepts will be selected for Phase B/ Formulation Refinement expected to begin in October 2006.    Interested respondents should have demonstrated capability and experience in the design and analysis, and/or the fabrication and testing, of advanced technology parachutes within the last 15 years. The anticipated parachute design and development studies will consider the following preliminary performance specifications.	Respondents should emphasize how their stated capabilities and experience relate to the following performance requirements: (a)	The experiment payload shall be launched from a sounding rocket with an apogee of approximately 150 km. (b)	The parachutes shall be designed to decelerate a payload mass between 300 and 400 kg in Earth atmosphere. (c)	The initial parachute (supersonic drogue) shall decelerate the payload to obtain the required descent rate (nominally 70 m/s) for terrain imaging between 10 and 2 km altitude.  From initial trajectory analysis, the parachute will be deployed at dynamic pressure up to 48 kPa with the payload at M = 2 and approximately 13 km altitude. (d)	The main parachute shall reduce the descent rate and limit the Earth impact velocity to 10 m/s. (e)	The main parachute shall be a guided control design that incorporates target selection input from NASA’s terrain guided landing system and provide closed loop control to the designate landing target.  The schedule for the Phase A Concept Definition is summarized at follows: Feb to May 06 - Conceptual Design and Analysis Jun to Aug 06 - Documentation Preparation and Reviews 1 Sept 06 – Concept Study Due Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria: (1)	Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel:	This criterion evaluates the offeror’s relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Provide substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments. Capability includes quality and management process certifications and systems. (2)	Cost and schedule control:  This criterion evaluates the offeror’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The offeror should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.  (3)	Facilities:  This criterion evaluates the offeror's facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration proposed. The offeror should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Teaming offers will be reviewed, evaluated, and selected at NASA LaRC.	Final partner selection will be made within 15 days from this synopsis response due date.  NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis teaming opportunity does not represent a guarantee for selection or award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited.  It is anticipated that selection of the proposal for the ST9 mission implementation would result in a Phase B contract for the selected partner.    Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to ten (10) pages, 12 point Times New Roman font, 1” margins (top, bottom and sides).  All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically in Microsoft Word or RTF format or Adobe pdf format, via e-mail by 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, February 2, 2006 to: Mr. R Keith Johnson at r.k.johnson@nasa.gov.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS ACQUISITION IS:

Background

The Installation of a new Department accounting system, Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) is now being performed by contractors and an interagency Department team of experts, but ultimate responsibility for operation and management of the new accounting system has been placed in the Division of Financial Operations, FMS, PSC.  The environment for the UFMS installation includes several ongoing interrelated HHS and Government-wide incentives that together represent an enterprise of  unprecedented size and scope that is having unparalleled impact upon organization and management operations in the Department of HHS.  The UFMS,  Shared Services Planning, Business Case Analysis,  A-76 and new emphasis on internal controls activity have created critical level demand for additional skilled professional manpower that is temporary and flexible, but expected to be needed for at least 2-3 years.  In addition to the new tasks required to develop and support UFMS, many existing employees have been reassigned to the project, and expert backup support is required.  Due to incrementally emerging efficiencies, new technologies and organizational changes, the quantities and configuration of professional manpower that will be required at the end of this period of transition is as yet, unknown.  A cost effective and flexible method of filling part of current manpower requirements in a manner that will retain future agency management options is to contract with skilled professional personnel.   The ideal candidate to fulfill systems accounting requirements would possess extensive knowledge and experience with the specific legacy financial systems (CORE and the subsystems that feed data to it), DFO/FMS/PSC/HHS financial operations, PSC organization, supported programs, and in addition, knowledge of the new system itself.  

Description of Services Required: 
        
Expert systems accounting assistance to (1) track, report and provide technical advice on the development, installation and operation of the new HHS Accounting System to assure the emerging system is fully enabled to fulfill all functional requirements of numerous specific financial services now provided by the Division of Financial Operations (DFO) for several HHS agency customers,  (2) assure ongoing accounting and financial services operations are not unduly disrupted by the installation, (3)  address security concerns, and (4) to assist in assuring the powerful new capabilities of UFMS are utilized to an optimal degree within the overall  plan for future business development.  

The work requires expert knowledge of Government accounting and financial systems.  It also requires comprehensive historical knowledge of HHS/PSC/FMS/DFO Financial operations, organization and specific programs supported.

            the new accounting system.   

2.   Provide the Director with recommended strategies for system conversion to UFMS
      with full consideration of the characteristics and purpose of all legacy systems.
      Advice will be provided in any format requested by the Director, including oral, 
      written or graphic reports, and meeting presentations. 

3.  Assist DFO managers with data cleanup required, such as open obligations,
     advances, receivables etc. and providing strategies and methods for “cleansing” data
     for compatibility with formats and files in the new accounting system.

4.  Assist in reviewing and making recommendations on internal controls required to
      maintain the integrity of data entered into the system and security of Government
      funds in all of the hundreds of  programs supported by DFO throughout the
      development stages of the new system.  
 
5.  Analyze business processes with the goal of developing recommendations for
     process improvement or new capabilities.

6. Participation in HHS and FMS planning groups and creation of miscellaneous
     planning documents needed to implement complex  process changes required by
     UFMS.  
     
7.  Technical assistance in solving specific systems problems as they may arise during
     and after implementation.
*.  
     All advice, technical assistance and documentation will be provided in the format requested
     by the Project Officer, including oral, written and graphic reports, meeting presentations and

Best value includes past performance, technical acceptability and price. Offers must meet all minimum specifications but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably. The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price. Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that technical acceptability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.

       The Contractor shall provide all the necessary labor, equipment, materials, transportation, and supervision to provide Clear Zone and Grassland Mowing of vegetation at the Naval Air Engineering Station, Lakehurst, NJ 08733.

24.1  The total area to be mowed under this contract is estimated at 938 acres.  The government guarantees the accuracy of this acreage figure to + 3 %.  Vegetation in these maintenance areas is to be cut once to a height of 8 inches. The contractor is responsible to modify (i.e., install larger diameter tires) his/her equipment to meet this height requirement. It shall be  accomplished in a manner so the machine does not cause rutting. No strips or corners shall be left.  The cutting edge of all mowing equipment shall be kept in sharp condition.  During the mowing operation, remove all rubbish and trash such as paper, cans and bottles and deposit it into the nearest government dumpster.  Any high stumps and large or heavy manmade obstacles that are too big for the operator to handle shall be flagged (or otherwise have the location noted) and reported to the Contract Inspector for subsequent removal by Government personnel.  Use of a Brush Hog or other heavy blade mower is strongly recommended for the west side of Mat 3 and certain areas of the Jump Circle and Test Runway Clearzone. All sprouting pioneering trees less than 3 inches in diameter measured at a point 12 inches from the ground must be mowed. At the far west end of the Test Runway, the grass is to be mowed within five feet of the shoreline of the ponds on the north and south sides of the runway extended. All areas of the Jump Circle must be mowed right up to the edge of the woods. Contractor shall proceed with caution while mowing because these areas include sites with rough, uneven surface grades.

24.2  DAMAGES:  All damages to Government property caused by the Contractor or Contractor Representatives/Employees shall be repaired or replaced by the Contractor at no cost to the Government. Rutting in the maintenance area will not be tolerated. All mowed areas damaged by the Contractor shall be smoothed out and reseeded at the Contractor's expense.  Seed mixture and rate must be approved by the Officer-In-Charge. A copy of the seeding mixture label, ingredients and all receipts must be submitted to the Officer-In-Charge.  When mowing near the Runways, special precautions must be observed by the operators to avoid damaging the Runway Lights.

24.3  The Contractor is entitled to bale and remove from the Station any grass clippings that are thick enough to be raked and baled for off-Station sale by the Contractor.  The Government estimates that a minimum of 300 of the 938 acres in the contract contains grass stands thick enough to produce removable volumes of straw.

24.4  This is debit/credit contract.  After the scheduled site visit, if prospective bidders feel they can harvest enough straw to exceed their estimated labor and material cost in executing the contract, they may bid the contract in the form of payment to the Government.

24.5  The Contractor shall contact the FSC Inspector 48 hours prior to commencement of work.
