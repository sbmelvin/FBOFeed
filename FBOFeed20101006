<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is soliciting quotes for the removal of snow for the Animas La-Plata project located in Durango, CO, required during the upcoming winter season from December, 2010 through April 30, 2011.  Snow removal is required at numerous locations to ensure employee access to the main office building and field trailers, and to provide access to the pumping plant and dam site operations facilities to conduct daily inspection duties corresponding to pumping/filling functions associated with Lake Nighthorse reservoir or other miscellaneous construction activities.  Snow removal activities will be required at the 6 following locations;
1.  Main Office complex and parking area (Located at 103 Everette Street, Durango,     CO - See attached Exhibit "A")2.  Durango Pumping Plant field trailers and parking area (Located northeast off County     Road #CR211 - See attached Exhibits "B and C")3.  Durango Pumping Plant operations facility (Located northeast off County Road     #CR211 - See attached Exhibits "B and D")4.  Gravel Section of County Road #CR211 (Intersection of County Road #CR212     traveling south approx 1-mile to Ridges Basin Dam field trailer - See attached     Exhibit "E")5.  Ridges Basin Dam field trailer and parking area (Located west off gravel section      of County Road #CR211 - See attached Exhibit "F")6.  Access Downstream of Ridges Basin Dam and Top of Dam (Located off County Road      #CR213-La Posta Road traveling northwest approx 3.5-miles to damsite - See      attached Exhibits "G and H")
General Requirements:
In general, snow removal from access roads and parking areas listed above will be required 24-hours per day 7-days per week throughout the duration of the service contract, unless waived by the government.  This removal will be required anytime snow accumulations on the ground exceed 4-inches, or upon notification by the government that slippery or slushy conditions do exist which present a potential safety concern regardless of the snow depth.  Severe weather conditions that persist resulting in snow accumulations of 4-inches or more being exceeded several times throughout the duration of a single storm event, may require subsequent snow removal trips.  Some sanding on icy/slick areas, especially hills, which present potential safety risks may be required to ensure safe passage.  Any subsequent snow removal requested by the government due to blown and drifting snow developing after completion of plowing activities between individual storm events, will be considered call back work and will be paid on an hourly basis for this type of additional work.
Site conditions of the roadways on the project consist of both paved and all weather graveled road surfaces.  All roadways must be maintained to a minimum of 24-foot in width, to permit travel in both directions and permit passing.  Various access road conditions to be encountered on the project exist, including; both uphill and downhill grades, steep drop offs, winding curves, corners, and limited turnaround in some locations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The statement of work for the requirement is:
<p><br />Correspondence Management System Operations and Maintenance</p>
<p><br />1. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of the Executive Secretariat in the Office of the Administrator is responsible for tracking executive correspondence and maintains the official records for the Administrator and Deputy Administrator. The effectiveness of the Office of the Executive Secretariat is dependent in part on its enterprise-wide information technology application called the Correspondence Management System (CMS). CMS is EPA's correspondence tracking and workflow management system that scans, logs, routes, tracks and stores incoming and outgoing Agency correspondence from and to members of the public, private, and governmental sectors. The purpose of this small business solicitation is to award a contract to support the operation and maintenance of the CMS application.</p>
<p><br />2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Developed using Documentum's E-Content Server 5, a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) document management solution, CMS provides a web-based user interface available for use Agency-wide to EPA personnel via EPA's secure Intranet. Documents are either entered or scanned into the system and routed through a review and approval process and a virtual record is created for each control. The system has predefined templates for responses and can import documents from other databases. After signature, the final document is scanned into the system. Authorized CMS users are able to:<br />&bull; View scanned correspondence images, drafted responses, control history, and assignment information;<br />&bull; Receive Lotus Notes e-mail notification;<br />&bull; Add supporting documents to controls from a CMS library or a PC or network drive;<br />&bull; Maintain citizen information and citizen correspondence history;<br />&bull; Search for existing controls based on a variety of control data; and<br />&bull; Generate reports, mass mailing letters, and control processing statistics.</p>
<p>The CMS application resides on the following file servers located in a secure, access-controlled environment at EPA's National Computer Center (NCC) in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina:</p>
<p><br />Hardware <br />System Software<br />1. Production Server Sun Fire V440 - E-Content Documentum 5.3 SP2</p>
<p>2. Production Server Sun Fire V210 - Web Content Apache Tomcat 2.29<br />3. Pre-Production Sun Fire V210 - E-Content Server Documentum 5.3 SP2</p>
<p>4. Pre-Production Server Sun Fire V210 - Web Content Apache Tomcat 2.29<br />5. Dell Poweredge 2650 Scanning Application Server InputAccel 5.3, Windows 2000 Server<br />6.

<p>Background and Objectives:<br />The capacity to evaluate pathophysiologic processes and evaluate innovative therapeutic modalities in an efficient and expeditious manner is an essential element of the efforts of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The Institute has supported efforts to evaluate control measures for infectious diseases during past decades and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of drugs and immunomodulating agents for the prevention and therapy of infectious diseases. With an increasing perception that old barriers to the spread of infectious diseases not longer are sufficient, the necessity for intramural activities and the Division for Clinical Research to broaden recruitment both nationally and in the increasingly diverse Washington metropolitan area has heightened. <br />The objective of this contract is to assist (NIAID) investigations of infectious and inflammatory diseases of importance by facilitating patient recruitment both locally and nationally.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is seeking sources that can assist its investigations of infectious and inflammatory diseases of importance by facilitating patient recruitment both locally and nationally. Specifically, the Contractor must be capable of providing the following services:</p>
<p>Establishing and maintaining relationships with community-based, public health and hospital-based clinics in the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan area within 50 miles of the National institutes of Health, Bethesda campus, with the purpose of promoting recruitment of eligible patients into various NIAID clinical studies, including candidates from the immigrant populations served by health facilities within this recruitment area, especially Africa, Latin America and Asia. The Contractor shall establish and maintain liaisons with clinics that are diagnosing and treating either US citizens or immigrant communities which regularly present with diseases of interest to the current intramural NIAID research program, such as HIV, tuberculosis chronic hepatitis, and Lyme disease. Currently, the NIAID has established relationships with the following clinics:</p>
<p>Upper Cardozo Health Center, Unity Health Care, Inc. (Washington, D.C.)<br />Carl Vogel Center. (Washington, D.C)<br />La Clinica Del Pueblo (Washington, D.

<SUBJECT>The Identification and Characterization of Therapeutics to Prevent, Modify and Treat Resistant Epilepsy:  Neuroprotectants as Countermeasures to Chemical Threats
<SOLNBR>NIH-NINDS-10-03
<RESPDATE>102210
<CONTACT>Helene C Braun, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email hb106s@nih.gov
<DESC>PURPOSE: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is interested in identifying sources with the requisite capabilities and qualifications to provide multiple pharmacological screening services directed at discovery of interventions in disease processes of seizure progression, new therapeutics for patients with epilepsy, resistant epilepsy and as countermeasures to damage resultant from possible exposures to chemical nerve agents. <br />The NINDS envisions awarding a contract for comprehensive in vitro and in vivo screening services in models/assays designed to identify and evaluate both the potential efficacy and toxicities of candidate compounds intended as lead therapeutics against resistant forms of epilepsy, interventions in disease processes of seizure progression and as countermeasures to possible exposure to chemical nerve agent induced damage. Hundreds of small molecules are submitted to the Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP) annually with the intent to assess their bioactivity for further translation of compounds possessing sufficient potency, efficacy, and drug-likeness (lead compounds) into late stage preclinical safety (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)) studies prior to investigational new drug (IND) application.<br />BACKGROUND: The ASP was initiated in 1975 in response to a congressional inquiry on therapeutic development strategies for the epilepsies. Since inception over 30T compounds have been evaluated for their potential as therapeutics to treat patients with epilepsy and other related Central Nervous System (CNS)&nbsp;disorders. For over three decades the ASP has contributed to the discovery, optimization and translation of candidate compounds resulting in FDA approvals for ten currently marketed AEDs, eight in various stages of clinical development and 100s of others currently undergoing preclinical testing and development. The ASP coordinates the activities of more than 500 domestic and international public/private research partnerships in areas of chemistry, pharmacology, model development and drug testing directed at epilepsy and related CNS research as well as countermeasures to chemical nerve agents. Summarily, hundreds of small molecules are submitted by ASP participants around the world which are then screened for both efficacy and neurotoxicity. The resulting leads are used to support participating sponsors with critically relevant preclinical evidence used for long-term toxicology studies required for submission of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) to the Food &amp; Drug Agency (FDA). An in-house NINDS stepwise decision making process involving expert pharmacologists, chemists and toxicologist are utilized to make interim selections on the most active compounds. Compounds are advanced through a unique multistage screening and analysis process. When a therapy is finally chosen its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile is compared to that of known drugs as well as those still under development. This intensive process assures that products being proposed for human trials provide a clear treatment advantage over existing therapies. <br />INFORMATION REQUESTED: With consideration to the above, the NINDS is requesting the following specific information as part of our market research in support of this program. It is mandatory that your response demonstrate your technical abilities and related scientific and managerial experience in a requirement-specific Capability Statement to: 1) quantitatively validate complete anticonvulsant pharmacological profiles for the 20 approved antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) prior to screening of novel candidates. The profiles require: ED&amp; TD50s, Std. Error of the mean, 95% confidence intervals, slopes of the regression lines, using both mice and rats by various routes of administration (i.p., p.o., s.c. and some i.c.v.) performed in the models noted below. Quantitative calculations must include at least three different doses using a minimum of eight rats and eight mice per dose per test. Testing must have been done in the range of models currently accepted as standard preclinical assays predictive of human efficacy. This requirement must be fulfilled and satisfactorily demonstrated before screening of novel candidate drugs can take place. 2) Demonstrate capabilities to accept, store, prepare and annually screen 750 to 1000 small molecules in the battery of in vivo and in vitro epilepsy models/assays utilized in the ASP, 3) obtain, adequately house and maintain hundreds of mice and rats for periods of weeks to months between and during test cycles providing evidence of meeting all IACUC and PHS animal certification requirements, 4) provide laboratory space, equipment, to adequately handle the large volume of molecules and simultaneous testing requirements, 5) demonstrate evidence of in-house expertise and competency in handling different rodent species, slice &amp; cell culture preparations, experience using chemical chemo-toxins (i.e. metrazol, bic, pic, NMDA and KA) &amp; proficiency in use of electrical stimulation models (MES, 6 Hz and kindling paradigms-hippocampal &amp; amygdala rat and corneal mouse, (note MES &amp; 6Hz testing is approx 750 annually while kindling is 300 candidates annually, testing requires both qualitative and quantitative assessment), culture preparation and chronic EEG electrographic monitoring for chronic antiepileptogenic and disease modification studies and evaluations (15-20 annually), 6) Provide evidence of possessing resources &amp; competency in using patch clamping techniques, 7) surgical skills using whole animals for kindling, electrographic monitoring &amp; interpretation of recordings necessary to differentiate candidate compounds, 8) report-writing and data collection capabilities 9) Other specific modeling requirements include: a) Morris Water Maze - forced swim with chronic dosing to test for cognitive impairment, depression (20-30 compounds annually), b) neuroprotection screening using organotypic hippocampal brain slices to against various excitotoxins (KA &amp; NMDA - note: must possess medium throughput capabilities for screening 500-600 candidates annually) c) both qualitative &amp; quantitative efficacy and toxicity testing using the pilocarpine resistant status rat models (600 compounds annually) and d) Chung and formalin model of pain e) sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain (200 compounds annually). 10) Provide evidence and examples of design, development and validation of new screening paradigms. 11) in vitro CYP inhibition studies (100 annually), &amp; metabolic gene induction studies using reporter cell lines (100 annually), 12) genetic model of epilepsy (Fring mouse - approx. 60 annually) and finally 13) evidence of capability to perform in vitro mechanism of action studies for both inhibition and excitation studies (GABA, NMDA and channels).<br />Please submit 4 copies of your response to the attention of Helene Braun, Contract Specialist, at the address provided by 4:00 PM Local Time on October 22, 2010.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the  Army Research Institute Environmental Medicne (ARIEM) intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Government Scietific Source, Inc. 12351 Sunrise valley Drive, Reston, VA. 20191-3415<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR>1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 13.106-1(b)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs:  The Military Nutrition Division is conducting research to better understand the complex regulatory mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass during energy restriction. Potential findings would provide support for future research for nutritional interventions, designed to preserve skeletal muscle protein under conditions of intense physiological strain.  The findings from this study will improve our current understanding of dietary conditions to prevent the damaging effects of sustained/repeated combat missions on musculoskeletal health in warfighters. These analyses require the use of a multimode microplate reader, a system currently not possessed by the Military Nutrition Division, to perform a series of experiments in order to characterize the cellular mechanisms associated with muscle loss. The intent is to award a Firm Fixed Price type contract for $35,875.00. <BR><BR>3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): The SpectraMax Multi-mode Microplate reader is a state-of- the-art multimode microplate reader that measures fluorescence and luminance. Other plate readers can measure simple measures of absorbance, but cant measure more advanced absorbance such as the fluorescence and luminance required for assays conducted by the Military Nutrition Division. The SpectraMax Multi-mode Microplate reader manufactured by Molecular Devices and is only distributed through Government Scientific Source, Inc. is the only product which meets the Military Nutrition Divisions requirements.<BR>  <BR>4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Market research was not conducted because this is the only viable product to conduct our research. An assay was developed using the SpectraMax Multi-mode Microplate reader. To achieve consistent results to compare to previous studies, this instrument is required. Otherwise, the prior studies would need to be repeated to proceed forward with this new study, resulting in lost time and additional expenditures.<BR>	 <BR>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: NA<BR>6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  Not feasible at our level.<BR><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: greg.n.wilson@us.army.mil no later than 8:00 a.m. on  October 11, 2010.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Greg Wilson, Contract Specialist<BR>Greg.N.Wilson@us.army.mil<BR>

Conduct analysis to include a prioritized list of dominant causes and proposed changes, and a trade study analysis of the effect each may cause on other vehicle requirements.  Estimated magnitude of the contract value is $200,000 to $400,000.  Requirements analysis is required 10 days after award of contract. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541380, Testing Laboratories.

<p>Nadcap certification in Heat Treating Places stringent requirements on data collection and storage. To become compliant with Air Force regulations addressed by Nadcap, our ability to accurately collect, store and analyze heat-treating data must be upgraded. The software that runs the Honeywell Multitrend SX data recorders is the only system designed specifically for Nadcap compliance and is currently being used to verify temperature uniformity in the heat treating furnaces. It is currently in use on two of the furnaces as a requirement for new furnaces and control system updating. In order to become Nadcap compliant it is necessary to integrate these standalone units into a complete system that collects, archives, and analyses furnace data securely. Since the proprietary data encryption integrated into the Honeywell system requires matching equipment to form a viable data system, it is necessary to purchase matching equipment for the rest of the furnaces. <br />The Honeywell Automation and Controls division has a legal arrangement giving distribution rights to their distributions based on geographic territories. Wilson Mohr has the distribution rights for Utah and is the only vendor through which these instruments can be purchased.<br /><br />Any questions regarding this requirement should be emailed directly to Francene Bielik francene.bielik@hill.af.mil</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT57-11-Q-80004 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5 and FAR Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-45, effective October 1, 2010. The NAICS Code is 541990 and the Small Business size standard is $23.0M. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order on a competitive basis to conduct a Section 106 historical research review of 36 buildings for the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) light rail transit project in Detroit, Michigan, in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) below.
<p>Statement of Work (SOW) - (Begin)</p>
<p>HISTORICAL RESEARCH UNDER SECTION 106 NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT</p>
<p><br />Federal Transit Administration<br />Woodward Avenue Light Rail Transit Project</p>
<p><br />I. 1.0 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Under an Interagency Agreement, the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is providing environmental compliance support to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). As part of this effort, a historical research review under the Section 106 regulations under the National Historic Preservation Act will be performed on approximately thirty six (36) historic structures either already listed on or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The effort will include effects determinations for the 36 structures.</p>
<p>The Woodward Avenue Light Rail Transit (LRT) project would extend approximately 8.5 miles from Downtown Detroit near the Detroit River north to 8 Mile Road along Woodward Avenue; total project length, including circulation in Downtown Detroit, would be 9.3 miles. The majority of the project corridor falls within the City of Detroit, with approximately two miles (from Webb Street to McNichols Street) located within the City of Highland Park. All construction, including tracks, rails, and stations, would take place in existing roadway rights-of-way and within travel lanes and/or median areas/sidewalks. The width and depth of ground disturbance would vary from approximately 28 to 48 feet wide and from 0 to 3 feet deep.</p>
<p>The Woodward Avenue LRT project would consist of a 9.3-mile fixed guideway LRT system along the Woodward Avenue corridor in Detroit and Highland Park, Michigan. The proposed system would use steel-wheel LRT vehicles with a typical train consisting of two cars. The system would be street running. The alignment would typically be located in the center median area of Woodward Avenue between 6 Mile Road to north of State Fair Avenue. South of 6 Mile Road to north of Grand Boulevard, the tracks would be located primarily in the center of the roadway.</p>
<p>II. 2.0 HISTORICAL RESEARCH</p>
<p>2.1 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Originally, a Native American trail, Woodward Avenue became the main thoroughfare for the City of Detroit and eventually stretched twenty-seven miles from the Detroit River in urban Downtown Detroit through rural and later suburban areas northwest of the city to the City of Bloomfield Hills. In 1863, horse-drawn rail car lines were installed along four major Downtown Detroit roads, including Woodward Avenue from Jefferson Avenue to Alexandrine Street. Electric streetcar service replaced horse-drawn rail cars in late 1892. Streetcar operations along Woodward Avenue ended in April 1956. Today, the Detroit People Mover, a 2.9-mile elevated light rail system, provides local service between buildings and neighborhoods in Downtown Detroit.</p>
<p>The Woodward Avenue LRT project traverses a diverse area containing commercial, institutional, civic, recreational, industrial, and residential uses. Woodward Avenue remains a major thoroughfare from the Detroit River and the Central Business District of Downtown Detroit north to 8 Mile Road. Throughout the proposed project corridor along Woodward Avenue, commercial, institutional, and industrial land use is most common, with sprawling residential areas frequently located beyond development immediately fronting Woodward Avenue. Both modern redevelopment and vacant and cleared land is most common between I-75/Fisher Freeway and I-94/Ford Freeway. Despite some modern development, older buildings and neighborhoods are located throughout the corridor. Many historic buildings and neighborhoods along Woodward Avenue have been listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or have been locally designated as historic by the appropriate local municipality or by the State of Michigan.</p>
<p>The portion of the Area of Potential Effect (APE) considered in this application, between Downtown Detroit and I-75/Fisher Freeway, is the southernmost portion of the study area. The APE in this portion encompasses the densely developed Downtown Detroit area and includes many of Detroit's most prominent historic sites, civic buildings, and cultural attractions, including Campus Martius Park, the Fox Theatre, major league sports arenas, and the Cobo Convention and Exhibition Center. Buildings in Downtown Detroit are predominately skyscrapers interspersed with smaller commercial buildings.</p>
<p>A phased historic property identification effort was deemed appropriate for the Woodward Avenue (LRT) project and coordinated with the State Historic Preservation Office. An application for Section 106 Review was prepared for the City of Detroit Department of Transportation in September 2010. As part of this effort, a historical research review under the Section 106 regulations under the National Historic Properties Act is required on approximately thirty six structures.</p>
<p>2.2 TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>The main focus of the historical research is to conduct effects determinations under the Section 106 regulations under the National Historic Properties Act using three (3) architectural historians who meet the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards. The Contractor will need to coordinate their historical research effort with the current contractor, Parsons Brinkerhoff Michigan, Inc., the City of Detroit and the FTA.</p>
<p>The above tasks shall include all travel and related expenses.</p>
<p>3.0 DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>A technical report will be prepared and submitted to the FTA and that documents potential project effects to up to thirty six (36) historic properties located within the APE that are listed in or determined eligible for listing in the NRHP.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall prepare the following required deliverables in the quantities described below:<br />-(One) hard copy of the historical research report<br />-(One) electronic copy of the historical research report</p>
<p>4.0 SCHEDULE</p>
<p>Work must begin immediately after contract award and the final historical research report must be received no later than November 10, 2010.</p>
<p>5.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION</p>
<p>The government will provide maps of the project showing the project and all structures to be evaluated, National Register of Historic Places status for all structures (listed or eligible to be listed), photographs and descriptions of all structures and methodology used to determines potential effects of the project on the structures. Below is a list of the properties to be examined.</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS -</strong> United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Volume I- Technical Quote shall contain (1) copy of the company Quality Control Manual, Past Performance, &amp; Delivery time in days for the repairs for each line item.</p>
<p>Volume II- Price Quote shall include the proposed pricing information IAW the attached Price Quote Spreadsheet.<br />The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) provisions apply:<br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (Apr 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)</p>

This evaluation may be accomplished via document reviews and/or a vendor site visit. Vendors must pass this evaluation in order to be further considered for contract award.<br />This evaluation will only be performed on vendors selected for possible contract award. Evaluation will be conducted and completed prior to contract award.<br />Evaluation Criteria: Only offerors successfully meeting the technical evaluation factors listed above will be considered for possible award and evaluated in the following areas. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following criteria in descending order of importance: delivery, past performance (relevant and recent) and price.<br />Delivery is the most important evaluation factor, with Past Performance being the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important.<br />Delivery: The offer must include delivery information IAW the attached Statement of Work.

The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.<br />Price: The contractor shall provide pricing based on the unit price of sparing, repair prices, test and evaluation prices, and labor rates for unusual damage, technical support, product improvement/engineering change proposal, service bulletins as requested in the attached quote sheet titled "HSCG38-10-Q-200170 Quote Sheet". The total price evaluation will be for the Base and all four Option periods. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (AUG-2009), <br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

Anticipated date of award is 31 October 2010.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>*****************<br /><br />AMENDMENT 9: <br /><br />The purpose of Amendment 9 to HSTS04-09-R-ST2180 is to notify potential Offerors of the Government's intent to execute a data collection effort for the upcoming Checked Baggage Inspection Systems (CBIS) procurement.<br /><br />In order to establish a Qualification Product List (QPL) for the upcoming CBIS procurement, TSA intends to use equipment certification readiness testing (CRT) data to evaluate the qualification data package (QDP). The QDP will be a requirement under the CBIS Request for Proposal and will be used to evaluate Offerors' ability to proceed to certification testing, which will be criteria for CBIS&nbsp;QPL and Indefinite-Deliver-Indefinite-Quantity contract award. TSA intends to use CRT data for equipment under various categories,<br /><br /><br />1) CRT data for TSA certified equipment without any configuration changes. Equipment under this category does not require re-testing for CRT and TSA will use existing CRT data to evaluate QDP for CBIS.
<p><br />2) CRT data for TSA certified equipment with configuration changes. Data previously collected under this equipment category will not be utilized for QDP evaluation due to configuration changes after the initial certification. Equipment under this category is required to undergo the CRT process again in order to collect new CRT data for purposes of evaluating the QDP for CBIS.</p>
<p><br />3) CRT data for new systems never certified by TSA. Equipment under this category is required to undergo the CRT process just like certified equipment with configuration changes.<br /><br />Data collection for equipment that falls under category 2 and 3 above will begin on January 15, 2010. Potential Offerors' that wish to participate in the CRT data collection, for any equipment that falls under categories 2 and 3, will be fully responsible for shipping, installation, and decommissioning of equipment proposed to be included in data collection. These activities must be completed by January 15, 2010. Note that TSA or vendor owned equipment currently located at the TSL is eligible for use for CRT data collection purposes; however, Offerors that wish to use TSA-owned equipment will be solely responsible for configuration changes expenses before and after testing.<br /><br />After data collection for equipment under 2 and 3 above is complete, TSA will share all system specific data simultaneously with the respective original equipment manufacturers. This includes data for equipment that falls under any of the equipment categories listed above. This data will be shared with all participating vendors on or about February 1, 2010.<br /><br />Any vendor interesting in participating in this data collection or to verify that the Government has sufficient data to evaluate the QDP for CBIS procurement, must contact the Office of Acquisition within 7 calendar days of this announcement. Any inquiries must be submitted to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov.</p>
<p>NOTE: Vendors planning to participate in the upcoming CBIS procurement will need this data in order to properly prepare a complete QDP package.</p>

Vendor submission of the Certification Readiness Testing Qualification Data Package (CRT-QDP) in accordance with the Certification Readiness Testing Qualification Management Plan (CRT-QMP ). <br /><br />2. Upon successful completion of the CRT-QDP vendors systems will enter into the Technical Testing which requires vendors to provide three systems for technical testing and submission of a Certification Data Package.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. Upon successful completion of the technical testing (which includes initial operational testing) vendors will be "Qualified" and listed on the QPL.<br /><br />4. Qualified Vendors will receive subsequent Solicitation (s); specifically the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Fiscal Year 2010 Checked Baggage Inspection System (CBIS) . The RFP is currently planned to be released in August 2010. <br /><br />The Qualification program represented by the steps listed above is described in greater detail in the CRT-QMP. Details provided include hardware delivery requirements, due dates, the program schedule and Government Point of Contacts (POCs). It is imperative that interested vendors request the CRT-QMP in a timely fashion as the CRT-QDP is required to be submitted by 1 March 2010. <br /><br />This requirement necessitates that vendors have access to documents Classified as SECERT and Sensitive Security Information (SSI). In order to obtain these documents vendors must have an approved DD 254 on file with TSA. If a vendor has previously registered and has been approved for a DD 254 under the RFI HSTS04-09-R-ST2180, the DD 254 is still in effect for the Qualification process. <br /><br />In addition to needing a DD 254, in order to obtain any documents classified as SSI, vendors are required to be a registered vendor and all personnel who will need access to this data must have a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) on file, and must be pre-approved by TSA to have access to classified information. <br /><br />All interested vendors are required to submit a request for documentation to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov . The request for documentation MUST contain the following information:<br />&bull; Company Name, <br />&bull; Mailing &amp; Street address (NO PO Boxes ) <br />&bull; Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code &amp; Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS number)<br />&bull; POC and contact information for :<br /><strong>Program Manager (main POC)</strong><br /><strong>Facility Security Officer</strong> <br /><strong>Sensitive Security Information POC</strong>: This person is required to be a senior corporate official who will serve as the single POC for SSI. This official must certify that SSI will be protected in accordance with policy and procedures. This official is required to notify the Contracting Officer of staffing changes or circumstances in which individuals no longer need access to the information. <br />&bull; A signed statement from the SSI POC certifying that all appropriate protections have been followed, only authorized individuals have access to the sensitive information, and those individuals with access adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information, and that the Contracting Officer will be notified of any staffing changes or circumstances in which individuals no longer need access to the information.<br />&bull; List of all personnel that will need access to Classified and SSI documents related to this requirement. Please identify to which level of access. (TSA may require the submission of additional personal information, if necessary.)<br />&bull; State whether the vendor is interested entering into a lease with TSA for the required systems. (TSA is currently researching options to help defray the costs which include allowing vendors to use Government-Owned EDS and or entering into a lease with the Government to fulfill testing requirements.)<br /><br />The Government will review the request and if approved provide the necessary documentation, if disapproved the Government will contact the identified POC for final disposition.<br /><br />For vendors not participating in the initial round, there will be additional opportunities to be placed on the QPL. <br /><br />Qualified vendors will compete with other contract holders for delivery orders. Vendors should be aware that TSA intends to award delivery orders based on Best Value, which will take into consideration an offeror's ability to meet non-minimum requirements. TSA reserves the right to require re-certification and/or perform additional testing, if deemed necessary. <br /><br />The procurement will be announced on the FedBizOpps.gov website, but only qualified vendors on the QPL will receive the solicitation.<br />

<DESC>**** Amendment 12*****<br />The purpose of this amendment is to update vendors on the status of the testing program. TSA has revised the CRT-QMP which will include changes to the schedule.
<p>Below is a list of major changes to the program:<br />1) There will be an additional opening for CRT-QDP submittal. Vendors who have already received a favorable assessment of a CRT-QDP package do not need to resubmit a package for the current configuration. <br />2) There will be three testing windows available for vendors to pass certification within this testing cycle.<br />3) Vendors who have received a favorable assessment of the CRT-QDP will be permitted to participate in Full Threat Weight (FTW) data collection. <br />4) TSA has added additional time in the schedule to allow vendors to use the FTW data for further algorithm development.<br />5) The Schedule of the CRT-QMP (located Appendix A) is a dynamic document; this document will be updated as needed. An updated schedule will be provided to registered vendors as needed.<br />a. Below is a summary of Revised major milestones:</p>
<p>Significant Milestones (Tentative; subject to change)<br />Completion of Window 1 Cert Testing December 21, 2010<br />Opening of Second Window Testing November 3, 2011<br />Completion of Window 2 Cert Testing February 3, 2011<br />Estimated Completion of Window 1 QPL April 29, 2011<br />Estimated completion of Window 2 QPL July 8, 2011<br />Submittal of Window 3 QDP October 1, 2010</p>
<p><br />Vendors who have received a favorable CRT-QDP assessment will receive the updated CRT-QMP schedule automatically.</p>
<p>All other interested parties will have to follow the process noted in Amendment 10 in order to receive any documentation related to this announcement. Vendors submitting a CRT-QDP for the second submission opportunity must submit the information requested in Amendment 10. It is estimated that the vetting process will take up to 10 business days. TSA will not grant vendors additional time for CRT-QDP submission to allow for vetting of a vendor.</p>
<p>Once a vendor is vetted, TSA will provide vendors with the opportunity to enter into CRT data collection. Vendors systems must be in place and ready to begin data collection no later than August 30, 2010 to participate. This data will be used by TSA to evaluate the CRT-QDP. TSA intends to use CRT data for equipment under various categories,</p>
<p>1) CRT data for TSA certified equipment without any configuration changes. Equipment under this category does not require re-testing for CRT and TSA will use existing CRT data to evaluate QDP for CBIS.</p>
<p>2) CRT data for TSA certified equipment with configuration changes. Data previously collected under this equipment category will not be utilized for QDP evaluation due to configuration changes after the initial certification. Equipment under this category is required to undergo the CRT process again in order to collect new CRT data for purposes of evaluating the QDP for CBIS.</p>
<p>3) CRT data for new systems never certified by TSA. Equipment under this category is required to undergo the CRT process just like certified equipment with configuration changes.</p>
<p>Vendors in category 2 &amp; 3 will be fully responsible for shipping, installation, and decommissioning of equipment proposed to be included in data collection. Note that TSA or vendor owned equipment currently located at the TSL may be eligible for use for CRT data collection purposes; however, Offerors that wish to use TSA-owned equipment will be solely responsible for configuration changes expenses before and after testing.</p>
<p>After data collection for equipment under 2 and 3 above is complete, TSA will share all system specific data simultaneously with the respective original equipment manufacturers. This includes data for equipment that falls under any of the equipment categories listed above. <br />NOTE: Vendors planning to participate in the upcoming CBIS procurement will need this data in order to properly prepare a complete QDP package.<br />Any questions regarding this announcement should be submitted to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov and provide Amendment 12: Company Name in the Subject Line.</p>
<p>This information is being shared with vendors for planning purposes only. Therefore, TSA is not responsible for any expenses incurred as a result of this RFI. The RFI does not represent an official acquisition plan nor does it commit the Government to any course of action in the future.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 13<br /><br />The purpose of this amendment is to provide vendors with further details on Window 1. As previously stated, the schedule is a dynamic document, and an updated schedule will be provided to registered &amp; approved&nbsp;vendors as needed.
<p>Window 1 of the schedule that was last published with planned contract awards in May 2011 has been modified as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; All equipment that passed the QMP is accepted into Window 1. The configuration that was proposed in the QDP must be in compliance with the Competitive CBIS Procurement EDS Configuration Requirements V0.3. New vendors will be able to enter the procurement process at the next open window point which will be announced at a later time.<br />&bull; Equipment that successfully passes certification testing, TSIF testing and OT&amp;E testing in the defined timelines will be placed on the QPL. Initial contract(s) under the established QPL will be awarded in July 2011.<br />&bull; For the certification portion: Vendors systems that are not currently certified to the Tier 1, 2005 detection requirements, must obtain certification to the 2010 V5.8 detection requirements for all categories except S and Z to qualify to be placed on the QPL. Vendors who have a letter stating they are currently certified to the Tier 1 2005 detection requirements do not need to be recertified to the 2010 detection requirements (minus S and Z categories). Vendors who choose to go back through certification to the 2010 detection requirements (minus S and Z categories) and do not pass certification will not be placed on the QPL and may resubmit their systems in Window 2. For those vendors submitting a system certified against the 2005 detection requirements, a copy of the certification letter must be submitted to the Office of Acquisitions no later than 9/5/10.<br />&bull; Equipment that is not in the Pre-CERT/CERT process or has not achieved certification will begin CRT on 9/8/2010. CRT will run 9/8/2010 through 11/1/2011. Equipment must be installed at the TSL and have the latest software updates installed before 9/8/2010. Certification testing will run 9/9/2010 through 1/10/2011. <br />&bull; An equipment delivery and installation schedule has been developed for delivering equipment to the TSIF. Please contact Manuel Leon or Samantha Gray to obtain the date your equipment is scheduled to arrive at the TSIF.</p>
<p>Data collection for 2010 detection requirements will continue in parallel to the effort identified above. Vendors who do not achieve certification will not proceed to the next level of testing in Window 1. Details for Window 2 will be provided at a later date.</p>

<DESC>Recovery Action: The purpose of this modification is to restate the Schedule of Supplies/Services in its entirety. Rationale: The award was competitively awarded as a Labor Hour Task Order due to the Government's inability to forecast or define the M&amp;O contractor's evolving scope of work. The DOE oversight of the contractor's performance of the ARRA scope of work will be intermittent, unpredictable, and undefined as the scope evolves and the work is executed.

<DESC>This contract is being issued as a response off of Broad Agency Announcement N00421-08-R-0003.<br /><br />The contractor is seeking to develop advancements to sensors (Acoustics, Electro-Optical, Radar, Magnetics, and other special sensors) and systems.&nbsp; The purpose of these sensors and systems is to support a variety of Naval Aviation missions including Air-Under-Sea Warfare (USW), Airborne Strike, Air Warfare, Counter-Air, Close Air Support and Interdiction, Defense Suppression, Electronic Attack, Naval Warfare and Amphibious, Strike, and Anti-Surface Warfare.&nbsp; Most of the sensors will be air deployed (via manned or unmanned aircraft), but ground, surface, and undersea deployable sensors will also be included when mission driven.<br /><br />This acquisition is for a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee contract.&nbsp; A Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Contract is the most appropriate contracting vehicle because this is a type of a cost reimbursement contract that provides for payment to the contractor of a negotiated fee (profit) that is fixed at the inception of the contract, per FAR 16.306(a).&nbsp; Additionally, the fixed fee does not vary with actual cost but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract, in which this flexibility is desirable for this effort.&nbsp; A Cost Plus Fixed-Fee contract is ideal as it allows for efforts that might otherwise present too great a risk to contractors, but gives the contractor less incentive to control costs than a fixed price contract.

	Naval Postgraduate School Monterey, California 93943
4.	Identity of person preparing justification (SUPARS 6.303-2):
5.	A brief description of the intended use or application (FAR 6.303-2):
The APOLLO 10 Detector system for Energy Dispersive x-ray Spectroscopy analysis (EDS) and the Hikari camera system for Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) were procured as attachments on the Zeiss Neon 40 Field emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM)  The EDS is for x-ray chemical analysis and the EBSD is  for crystallography and texture analysis and  are the primary instruments used in MS3202, Failure Analysis, and the systems are demonstrated as well in MS2201, Introduction to Materials.
 They are used extensively in MS4312, Advanced Materials Characterization Methods. The APOLLO 10 Detector system for energy dispersive X-ray analysis and the Hikari camera system for Electron back scattered Diffraction on our Zeiss Neon 40 Microscope are also used in a variety of ME thesis projects and also supports both thesis work and faculty research in three other departments (AA, ECE and PH). In addition many MAE and Physics department students routinely use this equipment in their thesis projects. Microstructural data collected using this equipment will provide the basis for student thesis research in concert with the requirements of the Educational Skill Requirements established by the Navy for the 570 Naval Engineering Curriculum at NPS.

6.	The critical or unique features which are mandatory in its intended use or application that limit their availability to a single source.
 The necessity for these features should be clearly indicated. Minimum essential requirements must be stated (FAR 6.303-2):

The scope of the job request requires the service of the APOLLO 10 Detector system for energy dispersive X-ray analysis and the Hikari camera system for Electron back scattered Diffraction on our Zeiss Neon 40 Microscope system with all components, which include repair mechanical and electrical systems, repair vacuum system such as detector, camera system, valves, gages, connections, etc for energy dispersive X-ray analysis and electron back scattered diffraction on our Zeiss Neon 40 Microscope system for best performance and images, and solve all kinds of problems. These service components must be compatible, both mechanically and electronically, with remaining detector and camera system components and are unique to EDAX Inc.
 This same company both service and does the repair/replacement of this detector and camera system. EDAX Incs experience combined with their superior training, support, equipment, and technology given to their field service engineer makes them the superior service provider to service APOLLO 10 Detector system for energy dispersive X-ray analysis and the Hikari camera system for Electron back scattered Diffraction on our Zeiss Neon 40 Microscope systems.

7.	A statement that no other known product possesses one or a combination of all the required critical features. This statement should elaborate on the steps taken which led to the conclusion that only a particular source or product can meet the requirement (i.e.
 market survey, investigation of sources) (FAR 6.303-2):

This company has installed the APOLLO 10 Detector for energy dispersive X-ray analysis and the Hikari camera system for Electron back scattered Diffraction on our Zeiss Neon 40 Microscope. Both these systems are attached to the Zeiss Microscope but completely operated and computer-controlled through proprietary software by EDAX.  The EDAX Inc. provides in field service to repair, install, and test/certify the APOLLO 10 Detector system for energy dispersive X-ray analysis and the Hikari camera system for Electron back scattered Diffraction on our Zeiss Neon 40 Microscope system. In any case, EDAX Inc. is the sole service/part provider for these systems.

8.	The existence of patent, copyright, or limiting features:

All proprietary hardware and software to operate and carry out data analysis are provided by the manufacturer/supplier of these equipments and only authorized parties who have all the required licenses to these products and their modification and changes can be requested to service these equipments.
 So only parties who are in possession of the all drawings, circuit diagrams and hardware, electronics and their supplies as well as software including updates can be requested to provide service contract for this equipment.

9.	Discuss briefly why the government doesnt have a specification and why it cannot write one for the procurement. Discuss also the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required (FAR 6.303-2):


This is a specialize item of research and educational equipments in a rapidly evolving technology area. It would be infeasible to write a specification that would remain applicable.
 Repairing/replacement service is required for proper operation of the APOLLO 10 Detector system for energy dispersive X-ray analysis and the Hikari camera system for Electron back scattered Diffraction on our Zeiss Neon 40 Microscope system for lecture and research. The service will allow more sensitive and demanding experimental procedures to be executed with higher control and accuracy producing reliable data. The originating manufacturer solely performs repairing/replacement service and parts on only their equipments. Due to the immense amount of training required to learn each companys complex equipment, competing companies do not provide any service to their competitors components.

<DESC>Currently the NPS ERN Network has a 1 Gbps peering connection to the CENIC DC Network. This project is to upgrade the NPS CENIC DC internet connection to a state of the art 10Gbps service.  CENIC and NPS can leverage Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) optics technologies recently installed between NPS and CENIC as a result of the successful NPS/CENIC HPR 10Gbps upgrade.   This project gives NPS significant additional high speed capabilities and path redundancies to the NPS campus.  Associated with this upgrade are additional redundant paths to CENIC Points of Presence (POPs) and border firewall upgrades to support future research and education traffic demand.  This upgrade becomes the foundation for future network service demands including grid storage/computing, virtualization, disaster recovery, distance learning, advanced video telepresence, and other initiatives.
  NPS has worked with CENIC in preparation for this network growth. The DWDM architecture recently implemented has the ability to support multiple 10Gbps circuits  connected to CENIC and other networks with minimal non recurring costs .  Some of these networks include CENIC DC, CENIC HPR, CENIC XD, Internet2, DREN, Monterey Peninsula DODnet, and Teragrid.   Best of all, there are virtually no additional recurring costs to our existing CENIC subscription contract.  With the new NPS 10Gbps architecture the 10Gbps port capacity is simply expanded incrementally, in a modular approach.  This insures NPS network growth with nominal non-recurring costs in the years ahead.

PROJECT # 666-10-811
BOILER PLANT DESIGN PROJECT
FBO PRESOLICITATION DESCRIPTION

The VA Medical Center Sheridan Wyoming, located at 1898 Fort Road, Sheridan, Wyoming is soliciting bids for the Boiler Plant Design Project Project #666-11-101.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Integrated Service Network 19 (VISN 19), is soliciting bids under Solicitation Number VA-259-10-RP-0161 for the following:

Professional Architectural/Engineering Services are required at the VAMC at Sheridan, Wyoming located at 1898 Fort Road, Sheridan, WY 82801 to provide an investigative report, contract documents, and specifications, and construction period services for necessary for the design of the new boiler plant.  The prime consultant may be either and architectural firm or a boiler plant design engineering firm, or an architectural firm with a boiler plant design engineering firm as a sub consultant. The project includes the complete replacement of existing boilers and all support systems within the boiler plant, including steam piping and accessories, feedwater and condensate transfer pumps, deaerator/feedwater, heater, condensate storage tank, condensate receiver, fuel handling systems, stack and emissions control systems, boiler controls, supporting electrical systems, etc.  This project will also separate 13 of the smaller residential quarters, buildings from the main steam distribution system design will include individual heating systems for each. New boilers will be factory-built packaged steel boilers, fire box, fire tube, water tube or hybrid design, high efficiency in order to meet VA energy mandates per EPACT 2005, EISA 2007 and Executive Orders.  Systems will include stack economizers and other energy saving systems that maximize efficiency.  AE shall select major boiler plant equipment and apply energy-saving systems based on fundamental economic analysis of the application of said equipment and systems.  The existing site steam distribution and condensate return systems may require augmentation to increase capacity to meet the steam load of proposed buildings.  A/E shall analyze the distribution system considering planned building projects to determine requirements for augmentations.  If modifications to the existing boiler plant building are needed for new boilers, such modifications shall be designed to meet the historic building requirements of the Veteran Administration.  Additional space and connection points into emission stream for future carbon capture technology shall also be incorporated in the design and indicated on plans.  The overall intent of this project is to have a new plant with a 30 year life that will not require substantial renovation during that 30 year period with overall plant efficiency above 80%, has low emissions and the potential for carbon capture.  The VA will also consider a design that has the flexibility to mix biomass with coal.  The design load must include additional future loads. Products used in this design must meet the Buy American Act. 

Design services must be completed by February 15, 2011. 

Design scope of work will include:
A.	Provide professional services including, but not limited to, conceptual design, construction documents and specifications, verification of as-built drawings, accurate cost estimates and construction period services. The designer will also prepare documents and submit applications for all permits required by EPA regulation 40 CFR Part 52.21 (Prevention of significant deterioration of air quality) on behalf of the VA.  They shall also prepare documents and file for all air pollution control permits required for operation of this Boiler Plant. 

B.	Site investigation of the existing plant must be completed to verify dimensions and current conditions of building and equipment required to support the generation of steam within the plant.  Any existing equipment that is to remain in place and operation must be identified in the report.  Investigation shall also include analysis of the steam distribution system to determine if the pipe sizes must be increased to meet design parameters.

C.	The design must, as a minimum, be in accordance with all applicable codes 

1.	VA "Design and Construction Procedures"
http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/cPro.asp

2.	VA Design Manuals
i.	Steam Generation Systems Design Manual (including energy center) May 2006
ii.	Outside Steam Distribution Systems Design Manual, May 2006

3.	ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code
4.	ASME Code for Pressure Piping
5.	NFPA 54 - Fuel Gas Code
6.	Other NFPA codes i.e. National Electrical Code, Life Safety Code, International Building Codes, and ASHRAE
7.	EPA Environmental Laws including both State of Wyoming and Federal requirements.  The designer will prepare necessary EPA documents for submission by Sheridan VA.

D.	The VA construction budget will be established prior to contract fee negotiation.  

E.	The VA will provide the design firm with the following:

1.	VA Standards and VA Master Specifications in electronic format (MS WORD) are available at the VA website http://www.va.gov/facmgt/standard/  Note the VA does not have specification or design documents on coal fired boiler plants and if this option is chosen then the designer will need to provide these documents. 

2.	The VA will provide the Boiler Plant and Steam Distribution study completed for this project.

3.	Access to any drawings or documents from previous boiler projects.  The designer will need to verify accuracy of any of these documents should they be used.  

F.	The boiler plant will be designed to meet the VA requirements for redundancy in the number of boilers (VA requires a minimum of three boilers with sufficient excess capacity that loss of the largest boiler leaves the plant capable of meeting full load).  The boilers shall be capable of burning coal to meet design capacity with  natural gas back up.  The existing gas delivery system will need to be evaluated to insure that it will meet the capacity to supply fuel to the boiler plant.  If the selected boiler system will not fit into the existing plant, the design of a new building or addition to the building will be required.  The appearance of this building will be required to meet the standards of the VA and in appearance and construction.  The building is in the National Historical register and all changes must be approved by the Station Historical Preservation Office.  The design shall be done in a manner that the plant remains operational at all times.  The current boiler plant has both summer and winter loads and operates 24 hours per day 7 days a week.  The design contract will require a detailed phasing plan to accomplish work and maintain steam throughout the construction period.  

	This project will be reviewed at the local level (Sheridan VAMC), regional level (VISN 19), and the national level (Department of Veterans Affairs Construction Facilities Management Office Support Services).

Other work as per drawings and specifications.

CONTRACT DURATION: Performance period is approximately 180 calendar days from date of receipt of Notice to Proceed.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source as this is a follow-on contract, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE:  This is a R&D type contract in support of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) issued against BAA-06-0002.  Cost contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost arrangement.  In addition, appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.

<DESC>The contractor shall provide shall furnish food, facilities, furniture, equipment, supplies, management, supervision and labor, within 7 miles of the VA-LETC for students attending the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Law Enforcement Training Center (LETC).  The period of performance is from 1 Oct 2010 through 30 Sep 2015.

The solicitation was issued using a cascading procedure as follows:

 In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.14 and PL 109-461, award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis first to an eligible Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business (SDVOSB) concern (see Section K, FAR 52.219-1, "Small Business Program Representations" for small business size definition) who submits a responsive offer, where award can be made at a fair market price. 

If  award cannot be made to a SDVOSB concern, award will be made to an eligible Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) concern.

If award cannot be made to a VOSB concern, award will be made to an 8a or HubZone small business concern.

If award cannot be made to an 8a or HubZone concern, award will be made competitively to a small business concern IAW FAR 19.5.

If there is inadequate competition for award and only one acceptable offer is received from a SDVOSB, VOSB, 8(a), or HUBZone small business, the contracting officer will make an award when it can be made at a fair market price following the cascade approach stated above.

If there is inadequate competition for award and only one acceptable offer is received from a small business, the small business's offer will be included with offers received on an unrestricted basis and the solicitation will be competed unrestricted.	`    

Adequate competition shall be deemed to exist if-
At least two competitive offers are received from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration; and
Award will be made at fair market prices as determined in accordance with FAR 19.202-6.

Using the above procedures, no proposals were received from SDVOSB businesses.  One proposal was received from a VOSB and was found responsive and their offer was at a fair market price and they were registered in the Vet Biz Registry at the time of due date for offers. Therefore an IDIQ type contract was awarded with task orders to be issued for requirements. 

The following award information is provided:

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.
This justification is executed by the Naval Medical Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, MD, on behalf of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD to support its Bone Marrow Research Program.

2.  Nature and/or description of the action.
The government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract by conducting negotiations on an other than full and open competitive basis with Applied Biosystems, North American Sales and Service, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, California 94404, Phone: 800-874-9868.

3.  Description of the supplies/services required.
The NMRC Bone Marrow Research Program has a requirement for the purchase of Big Dye Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit and POP-7 Polymer for 3730x1 DNA, analyzer.  This reagent is optimized for DNA sequencing applications that are performed on the ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer.  ABI is the only company that produces the BDT kits which are fully Quality Controlled (QC) under the ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer.  The kit is used to sequence our highly complicated HLA-DNA templates.  This is the only reagents that generates DNA sequencing data with great uniformity of peak-height. The proposed acquisition is to purchase Big Dye Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit and POP-7 Polymer manufactured by Applied Biosystems, LLC in support of NMRCs Bone Marrow Research Program.  
Applied Biosystems has patented and is the sole supplier and distributer of the BigDye Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kits and POP-7 polymers that are fully QCed under the ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer.
Fiscal year 2010 RDT&E funding in the amount of  $135,054.60 is provided under Document No. N3239810RCEA014.

Item No.	Product Description	Unit	Qty	Unit Price	Total Price
4337452	TF, BDT v1.1 RR-5000 & SEQ Buffer	Ea	4	$31,899.00	$127,596.00
4363935	TF, Box of 10 Bottles POP-7	Bx	2	$3,729.30	$7,458.60
					
	Grand Total:				$135,054.60




4.  Identification of the statutory exceptions permitting other than full and open competition.
The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 USC 2304(c) (1) and FAR 13.501(a)(2) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
These reagents (BDT v1.1 and POP7) have been optimized by this facility for DNA sequencing applications that are performed on the ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer as required for acceptable clinical and research results needed for marrow transplantation. BDT v1.1 and POP7 is the only reagents that provide the required level of high quality data, and permits success with difficult DNA sequences. 
The Bone Marrow Research Program currently utilizes two ABI 3730XL DNA analyzers which require the BDT v1.1 sequencing kits and POP-7 reagents in order to operate the instrument and there are no acceptable alternate reagents. These reagents are used to perform clinical and bone marrow research projects. We have been able to demonstrate on the HLA genes: sequence base typing (SBT), KIR genes SBT, and detection of HLA and KIR novel genes using these reagents. HLA and KIR genes typing are very critical for the treatment of leukemia patients and improving bone marrow transplant outcomes. We are unable to perform any HLA or KIR gene Sequence Based Typing test without the BDT v1.1 sequencing kits and POP-7 reagents. 
Applied Biosystems has patented and is the sole supplier and distributer of the BigDye Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kits and POP-7 polymers that are fully Quality Controlled using our ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer.

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.
ABI is the only source that can provide the BDT Kits and POP-7 Polymers. ABI has also patented this reagent.  

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
It is anticipated that the negotiated contract price will reflect a discount from the Applied Biosystems LLC commercial price list and will be determined fair and reasonable. 


8.  Description of the market survey conducted and the results, or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.
Market research of the peripherals was also conducted within the past 18 months reviewing other contracts awarded for similar or identical requirements.  (i.e., Contract No. N00168-09-P-1552.

9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.
None.

10.  Listing of Sources, if any, which expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
None. 

11.  Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
The actions are taken prior to the standardization to insure compliance.  Actions cannot and should not be taken after standardization to increase competition.  However, there is constant attention to the market to insure that should technology change, the standardization decision is reconsidered.

<ARCHDATE>10212010
<DESC>The requirement is based on the following:<br />The U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management (EM) has committed to making cleaned up EM lands available for use as "Energy Parks" - areas where private ventures aimed at green energy research and production can be located. The Hanford Site in Richland, Washington has roughly 60 square miles designated for future industrial use under its Comprehensive Land Use Plan that can be used for energy production projects consistent with the EM vision.<br />At the Hanford Site, there is no clear consensus view of what the "right" projects are - or even whether the lands should be developed at all. Three separate stakeholder segments have widely disparate values and beliefs on the subject and have thus far refused to work toward compromise. DOE cannot move forward on the Energy Park initiative without some common ground being established among these stakeholders <br />Accordingly, DOE seeks expert process design and facilitation to 1) understand the parties, what drives their viewpoints, and where the ability to compromise and collaborate might exist; 2) develop a facilitation process by which the parties can set aside politics and emotion and work toward common ground; 3) actively talk the parties toward that common understanding and a potential shared vision during an all-day session; and 4) recommend to DOE next steps and a path forward toward success on this important initiative.&nbsp;<br /> This notice is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. As a result of this notice, the Government may award a sole source contract for a period of up to two months.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR<br />OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />UNDER 41 U.S.C. 253 (C) (1)<br /><br />Elevator Maintenance Service<br />Robert C. Byrd Federal Courthouse<br />300 Virginia Street, East<br />Charleston, West Virginia<br /><br />1. Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity:<br /><br />This document is hereby identified as a 'Justification for Other than Full and<br />Open Competition' prepared by the General Services Administration - Region 3.<br /><br />2. Nature and/or description of Action Being Approved:<br /><br />This office proposes to procure, utilizing a sole source award, a contract for <br />Elevator maintenance services at the Robert C. Byrd United States Courthouse<br />located at 300 Virginia Street, East, Charleston, West Virginia 25301.<br />The resultant contract number will be GS-03P-10-CD-C-0xxx.<br /><br />3. Description of the Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:<br /><br />This procurement is for elevator maintenance for nine (9) elevators at the Robert C. Byrd United States Courthouse, Charleston, West Virginia. The nine (9) elevators include: Four (4) Passenger elevators, one (1) parking garage elevator, one (1) judge's elevator, one (1) freight elevator, and two (2) prisoner elevators. Maintenance services shall consist of all labor, parts and materials for repairs, services, and testing necessary to maintain all elevators, appurtenances and accessories in a fully operational mode at all times. The estimated dollar value of the procurement is $51,301.20.<br /><br />4. Statutory Authority:
<p>This justification for other than full and open competition is based upon the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by paragraph 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br /><br />The statutory authority, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) authorizes under certain conditions, contracting without providing for full and open competition. The Federal<br />Acquisition Regulation permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement shall be FAR 6.302-1, 'Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br /><br />5. Demonstration of the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications:<br /><br /><br />The rationales for use of the cited authority is that there were are no other firms under contract in Region 3 that are considered qualified to handle these particular requirements. It is determined that it would not be in the best interest if the government were to use another firm, as Kone, Inc. has provided invaluable services in the building to date. The services required are an extension of the elevator maintenances services Kone is currently performing under the original terms of their contract which expires on September 20, 2010. It is the intent of GSA to combine all elevator maintenance contracts into the new operations and maintenance contract which is scheduled to be awarded in August 2011. This award will bridge current service with the new procurement by ensuring dependable, reliable service from a proven source until such time as the procurement is awarded. <br /><br />Also, in support of continuing our current relationship with Kone, GSA and KONE, Inc., are currently engaged in a related project to install a new elevator monitoring system. The project entails upgrades to the controller software, wiring configuration changes, removal/ replacement of obsolete IT equipment, employee training, and warranty coverage on labor and materials. KONE, Inc. is still performing work on various elevators and control systems. The work that has yet to be preformed is critical and necessary for the successful installation and operation of the Lift-Net Elevator Monitoring System. The elevator monitoring system is covered under a ninety (90) day warranty on all labor and materials. The Lift Net Monitoring offers enhanced safety and security features. GSA, the U.S. Marshal Service and Court Security require extensive training in the operation of these features. <br /><br />6. Effort To Solicit Additional Sources:<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(2), this requirement will not be synopsized in the Commerce Business Daily. Delay in the award of the contract would result in serious injury to the Government. The elevator maintenance services must be maintained for the continuity of services and related projects.<br /><br />7. Demonstration that the Anticipated Cost will be Fair and Reasonable:<br /><br />It is determined by the Contracting Officer and based on the Independent Government Estimate (IGE), prepared by the Charleston Field Office that the anticipated cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable based upon the previous contracts negotiated with Kone, Inc.<br /><br />8. Description of the Market Research Conducted:<br /><br />A market survey was not conducted as it is proposed that the contractor being solicited is capable of completing the required services in accordance with the work requirements. <br /><br />9. Other facts supporting the Use of Other than Full &amp; Open Competition:<br /><br />Per FAR 6.302-1 a)(2)(ii)(B)(iii)(A)(B), agencies are permitted to utilize this authority contingent upon a reasonable basis existing that the services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in- (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Based on the above discussion, duplication of costs, learning curves of a new contractor, time constraints, approval of security clearances, and the lack of dependable elevator maintenance service would cause a severe hardship on the building tenants along with stagnating other related projects. Kone, Inc. has several on-going related projects in the building and has provided quality work to date.<br /><br />10. Listing of Sources Interested in the Acquisition:<br /><br />No other sources have expressed interest to the Contracting Officer in writing for this acquisition to date.<br /><br />11. Actions to remove barriers to competition:<br /><br />In order to ensure competition on subsequent acquisitions, the aforementioned procurement for the combined operations and maintenance contract will be procured using full and open competition.<br /><br />10. Certifications:<br /><br />A - Technical and Requirement certification as Required by FAR 6.303-1(b)<br />I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification, and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.<br /><br />signed by David France 10/6/2010<br />David France Date<br /><br />B - Contracting Officer's Certification as required by FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)<br />I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification, and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.<br /><br /><br />signed by Celeste W. Dow 10/6/2010<br />Celeste W. Dow Date<br />Supervisory Contracting Officer</p>

<DESC>The objectives of this strategy are to incorporate rapid, inexpensive assessment tools to measure contaminant concentrations in the sediment pore water, to use a biodynamic modeling approach to predict contaminant burden at the base of the food web, and to develop a general model to predict the ecological characteristics of recovery. The three objectives were tied together in that biodynamic modeling predictions of contaminant uptake, which depend on contaminant pore water concentrations measured with the rapid assessment tools, were employed in the general ecosystem recovery model. Using this comprehensive strategy, researchers assessed the ecological recovery at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Parcel F (San Francisco Bay, California) after in situ remediation by activated carbon (AC) amendment.  The field work demonstrated that sediments in contaminated tidal mudflats can be amended with AC using commercial equipment, sequester contaminants, and reduce exposures to pore water and benthic organisms.  It was shown that AC in the field retained its capacity to continually sorb PCBs months after deployment.  However, given that there are less overall reductions in the field versus the laboratory studies, it was determined that a follow up effort is needed to develop predictive models that assess long-term trends in PCB-pore water concentrations and availability under field conditions with slow mass transfer and heterogeneous AC distribution from brief mixing events in the field.

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1. Contracting Organization: 
Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 01, 940 Belmont Street (90C), Brockton, MA 02301-5596.
2. Description of Action: This request is for other than full and open competition for the Mammography Reporting System from MRS.

3. Description of Supplies or Services: VA Medical Center in Boston, MA has the need to purchase the Mammography Reporting Software System from MRS. This MRS software system automatically tracks patient cases, generating patient result and recall letters for VA staff to quickly and easily print. MRS provides flexibility for our Radiologists by allowing Radiologists to use voice recognition systems to enter results limiting potential transcription errors. It will also reduce the amount of time spent entering patient history, physical findings and film views. MRS generates medical audits and statistical reports and exports data to the ACR's National Mammography Database and the NCI's Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. This system will save the WPB Medical Center time, costs and will lower the potential for errors and it is fully HIPAA compliant.

4. Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.

(x ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy

Agency Requirements;

( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;

( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;

( ) (4) International Agreement

( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;

( ) (6) National Security; or

( ) (7) Public Interest

5. Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: This vendor is the developer and sole distributor of this software package. It is in the best interest of the Government to purchase this Mammography Reporting System, as it has already been successfully proven to be integrated within VISTA - allows the VA to track the patient's chart and the system automatically generates follow up information to ensure patient care is effective year after year.    

(FAR 16.505(b) (2) Exceptions to the fair opportunity process) that the government use this vendor to purchase this MRS system. Mammography Reporting System is the proprietary owner of the MRS software and is the only vendor who can supply software updates. This MRS system is the only system that can interface with HL7. Without the HL7 link it is unable to talk to our Vista and PAC's system.

7. Actions to Promote Competition: 

Research was performed to find out if other Vendors were available.

8. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price: The anticipated price to the Government is $ 60,900.00 to include the following items:
a. MRS V6.X SQL edition includes Single user, Single site, reporting system
b. Three additional MRS SQL concurrent user licenses
c. 2-way HL7 interface using MRS AutoInterface (with VISTA cooperation)*
d. Digital Softcopy Workstation Interface with GE CCOW
e. Worksheet printing option (prints MRS worksheets w/patient demographics and history)*
f. On-site Applications Training for five days
g. Two days of follow-up applications training, 1 location, 1 trip, up to 7 people
h. Data Import must meet MRS' Specifications (basic demographics, imaging assessment and recommendation,  
pathology outcome and recommendation, and recall dates only).

9. Market Survey (FAR 10): In accordance with FAR 10.001 market research was conducted to find out if other contractors offer the same type of service/system. The research yielded only Mammography Reporting System as the only possible source.

11. Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: 
Only Mammography reporting Testing has this product available.
Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition:

"	Identify skilled health professionals to provide training
"	Develop training curriculum for mini-residency
"	Identify training equipment and resources required for each training topic
"	Develop and execute a marketing campaign to advertise the mobile mini-residency training program
"	Provide the mini-residency training program on at least three occasions to each CBOC
"	Track participation and evaluation of the mini-residency training program

Estimated dollar value:  $200,000

4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY:

The requirement was procured under Public Law 109-461, as codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128 and in accordance with FAR 6.302-5 (Authorized or Required by Statute). Furthermore, the requirement was procured in accordance with Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulations (VAAR) 819.7007 (Sole Source Awards to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns).

5.  RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE:  

Pursuant to Public Law 109-461, and as codified in 38 U.S.C. 8127(b), contracting officers may use noncompetitive procedures (including sole source awards) in acquisitions for an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold to make awards to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB).
Pursuant to VAAR 819.7007, a contracting officer may award contracts to SDVOSB concerns on a sole source basis provided: (1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5 million; (2) The requirement is synopsized in accordance with FAR part 5; (3) The SDVOSB concern has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance; and (4) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price. As stated in VAAR 819.7007(b), the contracting officer's determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer and a determination that only one SDVOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required.
The contractor, Atlas Research, LLC is a registered SDVOSB, as verified at http://www.vetbiz.gov.

6.  EFFORT TO SOLICIT POTENTIAL SOURCES:  

No effort to solicit potential sources was done, since this acquisition was done as a sole-source contract award to an SDVOSB under  Public Law 109-461, as codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128, in accordance with FAR 6.302-5 (Authorized or Required by Statute), and in accordance with VAAR 819.7007.

7.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: 

The Contracting Officer will review existing VA contracts with Atlas, as well as GSA fully loaded labor rates from comparable GSA schedules to determine the proposed price is fair and reasonable.

8.  MARKET RESEARCH: 

None conducted.

9.  ADDITIONAL SUPPORT:  N/A

10.  OTHER INTERESTED SOURCES:  N/A

11.  FUTURE COMPETITIVE PLAN: 

This will be a one-time training funded by VISN 5. No future competitions for this type of training are contemplated at this time.

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: 

I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
