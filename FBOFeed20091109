<DESC>The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron, Eglin AFB, FL anticipates awarding a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions Schweiz (RWMS) AG Birch Strasse 155; Zurich, Switzerland 79395. It is anticipated that the total contract period of performance will not exceed two (2) years from time of award and will have an estimated value of $1,300,000.00. <br /><br />The USAF will procure up to 5,000 rounds of Rheinmetall 25mm x 137mm FAP ammunition to evaluate firing performance with respect to the GAU-22/A gun/ammunition/aircraft interface requirements. On the basic contract the government will be buying 2,500 rounds of 25mm x 137mm FAP ammunition and another 2,500 rounds of 25mm x 137mm as part of an Option. <br /><br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The authority for this action is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1: Agency requirements can only be met by one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. In accordance with DFARS 206.302-1, this authority is applicable as it may be used for "acquisitions of test articles and associated support services from a designated foreign source under the DoD Foreign Comparative Testing Program."The USAF has been authorized to conduct a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program by OSD to evaluate and qualify a 25mm x 137 Frangible Armor Piercing (FAP) round for the USAF Joint Strike Fighter's GAU-22/A gun system. <br /><br />The candidate FAP round chosen for this FCT is developed and manufactured by (RWMS), formerly Oerlikon Contraves Pyrotec AG. An ammunition study was conducted in 2005. The result of this exhaustive study was that only ammunition proposed by Rheinmetall satisfied both effectiveness and safety requirements. Market Research completed in 2008 as part of the FCT confirmed Rheinmetall ammunition to be the only suitable choice available. RWMS possesses the only non-developmental round that meets the 9,000-foot operational requirement, and is a dual-purpose operational and training round. RWMS also possesses the required TRL level, does not require developmental funds and meets the 1.4 Hazard Classification design objective.<br /><br />The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.

<p>1. Action Code: P<br />2. Classification Code: A<br />3. NAICS: 611710<br />4. Title: U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Educational Statistics, HSLS:09 First Follow-up of the High School Longitudinal Study - 2009 <br />5. Response Date: December 24, 2009, 2:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time<br />6. POC: Lenox Coles and John Machen<br />7. Solicitation Number: ED-IES-10-R-0006<br />Description: The Department of Education is seeking qualified firms to plan/conduct the first follow-up of the Department of Education's High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS:2009). The first follow-up to the High School Longitudinal Study: 2009 is the second round of a large, complex data collection designed to continue the series of longitudinal data collection efforts that began with the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS-72), and was followed by High School and Beyond (HS&amp;B), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002). HSLS:09 began with a ninth grade cohort in the fall of 2009. The cohort will be re-contacted in spring 2012 when most of the sample are 11th graders. The first follow-up of HSLS:09 will survey students and their parents, administrators, and school counselors. Eleventh grade students will be asked to complete a mathematics assessment that focuses on algebraic skills and reasoning. The method of data collection will include computer adaptive technology and telephone interviews. The first follow-up of this study will culminate with data files, a First Look report, and data file documentation. The work will be monitored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Highlights for this study include: The new additional College Update data collection in the spring of 2013; the survey's emphasis on course-taking, college preparation, college financing, and plans for the 2013-2014 year; no teacher data collection in spring 2012, but student, parent, administrator, and counselor data. The proposal should concentrate on demonstrating expertise in sample design, computer administered assessments, computer assisted interviewing, large scale data collections, working with school districts and schools, writing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance packages, methodological reports; and proven, successful experience in providing a large pool of field interviewers on short notice with differing time durations. The anticipated response date is 11/24/2009. Additional information on how to submit a proposal for this requirement is located at: Solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov., Solicitation Number: ED-IES-10-R-0006. All responsible sources who qualify may submit a proposal that, if received timely, shall be considered by the agency.<br />8.

Currently, the Cytyc Corporations testing systems reside at many of the Medical Treatment Facilities on a Cost-Per-Test and Non-Cost-Per-Test basis. The ThinPrep Pap Test provides the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved option for the MTFs to perform Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing after an ASCUS (positive) result is received out of the ThinPrep vial.  

Through Market Research, it has been determined that Cytyc Corporation is the only FDA approved manufacturer for this bi-modal testing (FDA approval for both their ThinPrep Liquid Based Cytology and reflex HPV testing).  Also, Cytycs test kits are specifically configured to support Cytycs testing systems employed at many of the MTFs.  No other manufacturer or distributor sells or has access to these products manufactured by Cytyc.  Only Cytyc has the capability of providing the required items. 
 
This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  Cytyc will be asked to provide a Continental United States (CONUS) catalogs for Cost-Per-Test and Non-Cost-Per-Test customers and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalogs for Cost-Per-Test and Non-Cost-Per-Test.  Cytyc will also be required to develop a CONUS and OCONUS catalog for their ThinPrep Imager on a Cost-Per-Test basis.  These catalogs will be loaded in the DSCP ECAT system.  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of all items inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.  

All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Acknowledgment and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgments, send 855-Order Acknowledgments and transmit 810-Invoices for payment.  There are two communication strategies available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface and the American Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI standard for direct EDI.  Cytyc Corporation must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options.  They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.  

The contract resultant from this solicitation will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated value of $39.35 million.  Solicitation SPM2DE09R002 is expected to become available around January 20th, 2008 and can be found on the DLA Internet Bid Board website at www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil .

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this requirement is to purchase the design and fabrication of a second generation optical dosimetry system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The contractor shall design and construct a second generation design of the NCI, Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Fiberoptic Dosimeter System with four measurement channels and real-time measurement capability using a self-gated circuit design. The NCI along with NRL developed a clinically viable radiation dosimetry system based on copper doped radiation detectors which NRL patented.<span>&nbsp; </span>NCI and NRL jointly developed a first generation multiple fiber measurement system and holds the patent on that system.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Radiation Oncology Branch of the CCR treats cancer patients with radiation according to approved clinical protocols.<span>&nbsp; </span>One set of these protocols involves the use of stereotactic radiosurgery to treat small intracranial lesions.<span>&nbsp; </span>The size of these lesions makes accurate dose measurements difficult because the field sizes are comparable to the dimensions of the measurement system detectors, leading to inaccuracies.<span>&nbsp; </span>Additionally, ROB conducts research on small animals and has purchased a small animal irradiation system which also utilizes very small radiation fields.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again, small field dose measurements are not possible with systems currently utilized by ROB for such purposes. Recently, specialized PROMs have become available which make it possible to replace the software programming with a second generation system that will be useful for small fields radiation measurements with high energy, pulsed radiation beams as well as with low energy x-ray fields. Coleman Technologies&rsquo; senior developer developed the software and interfaces for the first generation of the NCI-NRL Fiberoptic Dosimetry System. They are uniquely qualified to undertake the development of a second generation hardware-based system and are intimately familiar with the problems existing in the first prototypes and how to overcome them. Because of the needs for measuring radiation dose in extremely small volumes for both clinical and research applications, Coleman Technologies is the sole source for delivering a complex, working system in a timely manner.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERYArchitect-Engineering Design Services.  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO ANDREWS AND ANDERSON ARCHITECTS, CONTRACT NUMBER 1443C2000800300, as a logical follow-on task order
Andrews & Anderson Architects and the subcontractors on their IDIQ Team have been involved in the project from the initial scoping through mock construction evaluations.  To actively seek and procure the services of any other A&E firm to participate in the completion of the schematic design phase would be a detriment to Carlsbad Caverns National Park, to the National Park Service, and to the U.S. Department of Interior.  A firm other than Andrews & Anderson would have a difficult time getting up to speed on the investigations, analyses, and conclusions made to date on this unusual and highly technical project.  Bringing in another firm would surely cost the Federal Government more money and more time and would jeopardize awarding this ARRA project by the send of fiscal year 2010.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>Air Force Subscale Aerial Targets (AFSAT) - Launch Rail System - The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 691st Armament Systems Squadron, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL. The Air Force is pursuing a launch rail system for use with the BQM-167 aerial target. The launch rail system is defined as the launch rail, control box, the launch consoles, software, technical data, spares and associated tools, support equipment and test equipment. Goals for the launch rail system are to be less manpower intensive and ease of operations for end user in comparison to the currently used modified BQM 34 rail system. Transportability to support remote operations and infrastructure at other test ranges, the ability to fly missions with under-wing payloads and removable maintenance stands are objectives for this effort. The launch rail system must have a minimum 20 year life cycle without requiring major overhaul and demonstrate survival of a highly corrosive saltwater environment. The system must be capable of launching all BQM-167 target configurations (clean, infrared, and electronic attack) at target weights of 1,400 to 2,050 pounds. It must allow use of the rocket assisted takeoff and be ready 24 hours prior to launch and operate in day, night, and inclement weather conditions. The system must be capable of supporting two mission periods per 24 hour period with no more than four hours between missions. The Air Force is projecting to purchase 9 launch rail systems and desire all systems be operational within 12 months after contract award. The Air Force requires Operational &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) training and published technical manuals prior to the start of operations. Respondent must perform maintenance task analysis and develop maintenance technical orders IAW MIL-DTL-87929 and MIL-PRF-83495. Respondent must provide sufficient data for Government to perform Type I cataloging IAW Air Logistics Center requirements. Respondent must provision common hardware and components needed for organizational-level repair on the launch rail and associated support equipment. Respondent must perform Type II cataloging for peculiar components and SE. Respondent must be capable of performing contractor depot-level maintenance on the launch system over its 20-year life-cycle, to include providing spare/repair parts. O&amp;M of the launch system must be accommodated within the current Air Force manpower resources. The launch rail system shall minimize impact to existing range subscale launch infrastructure. The Air Force has limited development funding for this acquisition. The Government does not own a technical data package and/or software data rights for the BQM-167A target system and its peculiar support equipment and therefore cannot provide this data to interested parties.</p>
<p>The Air Force will be using production funds (3010) only for this effort. RDT&amp;E funds (3600) are not available. The interested parties must be able to deliver the installed system no later than five months after contract award for the initial rail and delivery of the remaining rails at the rate of one rail every two months.</p>
<p>The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the government to any specific acquisition approach. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment to contract by the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Armament Research and Development Command (ARDEC), located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, is seeking capabilities statements from firms that can provide technical advancement in developing NightMarker nighttime covert marking materials to increase operational life beyond two (2) months (to an objective 6 months life) and to provide water resistance such that the solution will not wash away or degrade in terms of fluorescence intensity/range of detection (50m minimum) after heavy rain.  It is desired to achieve this goal without compromising the spectral integrity of the materials to ensure optimal opeartional effectiveness.  Additionally, it is preferred that the solution be comprised of both day and nighttime detection capabilities and be applied in a simple effective manner.  To achieve this, NightMarker will work to combine both day and night solutions developed, again without jeopardizing the operational effectiveness of the solutions as they are individually.
The product and process of deployment shall be examined to improve the efficiency of deploying large quantities of the solution over large battlefield areas (square kilometers).  One gallon of the improved solution shall be delivered at completion of the effort for Government evaluation.  The contractor shall also provide a milestone delivery schedule to meet potential Army needs of a total of 1,000 gallons of the solution delivered within a maximum of 3 months after order placement.
This effort is essential to provide the warfighter with convenience of both day and night solutions for visual detection.  The required research will help identify a technology solution that can be easy to apply, long lasting, environmentally stable, and provide detection from a safe stand off distance of 50+ meters.
This Market Survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This Market Survey is not to be construed as a commitment by the U. S. Government.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  No award will be made as a result of this Market Survey.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this Market Survey.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey or results of information submitted.  Please submit your responses NLT 1500hrs (3:00 PM) EST, 23 November 2009.  
Interested parties are requested to submit a detailed description of their services along with other available information (i.e. brochures) that describe current capability to:  Miss Kristen M. Ryback via email only to kristen.ryback@us.army.mil.

The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>1. SCOPE.<BR>Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term items that can be researched, and acquired quickly. The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed.  The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain potential solutions that provide the detection and real-time reporting via local and long-haul communications of tampering and intrusion to protected enclosures   Alternative solutions submitted by companies responding to this RFI will also be considered.  <BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to the Army Product Manager REF who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>2. REQUIREMENTS. <BR>The REF has a need for a technology or system at a minimum of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Seven (7) that will provide the capabilities of detecting the cutting, welding, tampering, and intrusion through a grated rebar protected enclosure.   Once triggered, the device will provide a local alert (to vehicular or handheld device) and a long-distance alert (to a central monitoring station).   The devices will operate day and night, 24/7, in all weather conditions.<BR><BR>2.1.	The system must detect disruption of fenced or rebar-protected area.<BR>2.2.	The system must provide real-time notification.<BR>2.3.	The system shall be covertly emplaced on or around the enclosure and not easily detectable, removable, or defeatable.<BR>2.4.	The system will include an anti-tampering system <BR>2.5.	The system will provide notification of intrusion and tampering and good health to approaching US forces at ranges of greater than 200 m.  Radio and/or satellite notification should be compatible with existing military radio/monitoring systems.    <BR>2.6.	Battery life will be 12 months or greater (18 to 24 months preferred).<BR>2.7.

I.  General Statement of the Purpose of this Contract and Responsibilities of the Contractor

The Office of Civilian Police and Rule of Law within the Bureau for International Law Enforcement and Narcotics assists host foreign countries to reform or establish more effective criminal justice systems, including the individual agencies that comprise such systems such as civilian law enforcement, public prosecutors, courts and corrections.

The Senior Advisor for Criminal Justice Assistance (CJA) reports to the Director of the Office of Civilian Police and Rule of Law (INL/CIV), serving as part of a team of senior experts which includes a Senior Police Advisor (SPA) and a Senior Corrections Advisor (SCA) that assist the bureau on the full range of criminal justice issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in failed or failing states, peacekeeping missions and complex security environments.  The CJA will coordinate closely with the SPA and SCA to ensure his/her efforts are closely coordinated without overlapping into their areas of responsibility.  The CJA will also coordinate closely with other criminal justice and rule of law advisors in the bureau, including those in the civilian response corps, to help ensure a common approach and a prioritization of efforts.

The CJA would provide the technical criminal justice expertise within INL/CIV, and on behalf of INL/CIV in interagency settings, for activities aimed at improving INL and broader USG and international capacities to provide criminal justice sector assistance in stability and reconstruction missions.  S/he would play a key role in contingency planning and development of future missions.  S/he would also serve as a resource for the managers of INL/CIV programs already underway, providing expert guidance to assist in implementing, monitoring and evaluating U.S. foreign policy directives regarding the development of criminal justice sector reform programs managed by INL.

The CJA will help INL design criminal justice capacity building programs (for the administration of justice, prosecution, judiciary, and defense services), that are consistent with the goals of the mission.  S/he will serve as liaison with other INL programs and relevant/appropriate host government officials and assist INL program officers/managers in preparing budgets, program evaluations, and relevant contracting documents.  S/he will assist program officers on an as needed basis in exercising quality control through field assessments of INL programs.  

The CJA will frequently meet with members of other U.S. Government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and at times, international community during periodic travel for the purpose of gathering and disseminating information pertinent to justice sector development.

II. Background

INL/CIV is part of the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in the Department of State.  The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought

A.	General Information.  

The Northeast Region (TRBO Reg. 1), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia including institutional and operational healthcare settings announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of ORAL CARE KITS.   
This product line includes but is not limited to the Oral Care Kits which help clinicians decrease the frequency of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) by reducing bacterial colonization in the mouth and on the teeth of critically ill and ventilator patients.  The components of these items are to be based on cleansing, debriding, removing and preventing plaque, suctioning, refreshing and moisturizing activities.  Vendors are required to supply items listed in all sizes, concentrations, cleansing, and antiseptic, antiplaque, and antimicrobial properties.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA), Keller Army Community Hospital (West Point, NY), and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (FT Meade, MD). 

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one year (12 months) option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is January 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.    However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  
Point of Contact: Toni Massenburg, (202) 782-3666, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil.  

B.	Products & Performance Required.  

The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of ORAL CARE KITS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $32,054.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.

At the request of the Northeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors.  

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Toni Massenburg, (202) 782-3666, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil or  Tracy Martin-Tilghman, (202) 782-3663, tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil as a back-up.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Northeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  

The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.  The TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s).  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  

Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process:  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to toni.massenburg@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price proposed package discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:
1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Oral Care Kit products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  
a.	At a minimum, this product line consists of a complete line of sterile, properly-sized toothbrushes with toothettes, suction catheters, covered yankauers and swabs of appropriate sizes and configurations along with cleaning solutions containing antiseptic and antimicrobial properties.  Vendors are required to supply items listed below.

b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via catalog, and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply items listed in all sizes, configurations, and concentrations containing antiseptic and antimicrobial properties.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).
2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Oral Care Kit product line.  Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  
3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for Oral Care Kits in the Northeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. 
4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.
5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Oral Care Kit products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.    
6.	Vendor MUST provide Oral Care Kit products that have infection control features such as those items containing antiseptic and antimicrobial properties and FDA approved that are an integral part of the purpose for the Oral Care Kits.  Vendors MUST identify their infection control features of their products and provide literature to support this in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.    
7.   Vendor MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendor MUST provide list of all latex  
      safe/free items supplied such as catalogs, etc. in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.


Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:
Clinical/Performance Evaluations
1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the to the CPT members at participating Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs), and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the participating MTF address by COB, 5:00PM EST, (14) calendar days after the notice to ship.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the product samples by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  
2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.
3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.50 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).
4.	To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Northeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a clinical/patient care setting. 
5.	Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations.  Vendors WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.  
6.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process.

Clinical/Performance Criteria:  
1.	The CPT identified that the standards of care that the Northeast Region medical communities adhere to, specifically related to Oral Care Kits, are those that will be the basis for specific technical/company and clinical/performance criteria.  The standards are set forth by the following: 
a.	The CDC's and Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committees  (HICPAC) 2003 "Guidelines for Preventing Health-Care-Associated Pneumonia" the prevention or modulation of oropharyngeal colonization by:
 i. Conclusion: Oropharyngeal cleaning and decontamination with an antiseptic agent: develop and implement a comprehensive oral-hygiene program (that might include the use of an antiseptic agent) for patients in acute-care settings or residents in long-term-care facilities who are at high risk for health-care-associated pneumonia (category II recommendation - suggest implementation and supported by clinical or epidemiological studies or by strong theoretical rationale).
b.	Survey of Oral Care Practices in US Intensive Care Units, Catherine Binkley DDS, MSPH , L. Allen Furr PhD, Ruth Carrico PhD, RN and Cynthia McCurren PhD, RN, American Journal of Infection Control, Volume 32, Issue 3, May 2004, Pages 161-169:
i.  Conclusion: Effective oral care that includes toothbrushing and antimicrobial solutions has been shown to improve patient oral health and may significantly reduce respiratory infections in mechanically ventilated patients.
c.	Duration of Action of a Single, Early Oral Application of Chlorhexidine on Oral Microbial Flora in  Mechanically Ventilated Patients: a Pilot Study,  Mary Jo Grap PhD, RN, ACNP, Cindy L. Munro PhD, RN, ANP, R. K. Elswick, Jr PhD, Curtis N. Sessler MD, FCCM and Kevin R. Ward MD, Heart & Lung: The Journal of Acute and Critical Care, Volume 33, Issue 2, March-April 2004, Pages 83-91: 
i.  Conclusion: Trends in the data suggest that use of chlorhexidine gluconate in the early post-intubation period may mitigate or delay the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
d.    Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia and Pressure Ulcer Prevention as Targets for Quality Improvement in the ICU,  Critical Care Nursing Clinics of North America, Volume 18  Number 4  December 2006: 			
i.	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in their recent guidelines on the prevention of health careassociated pneumonia recommended the implementation of a comprehensive oral care program as a care practice to reduce VAP rates. 
ii.	Chlorhexidine oral rinse has been shown significantly to reduce gram-negative, gram-positive, and virus colonization of the oral cavity for a sustained period of time up to 6 hours. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below:   

1.	(Staff Efficiency of Care/ Patient Safety) The closed tracheal system maintains compliance for ventilator patients so there is no need to break the system to provide oral care.
a. Clinicians require product to remain a closed system that provides a dedicated line for oral  
    care. 
b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (5)  
    patients.
      c. Evaluator will use the Y-connector to provide oral care while maintaining a closed tracheal 
          system.

2.	(Patient Safety) The thumb port tool provides good suction control and allows for quick
tool changes. The port connects to standard suction lines. 
a.	Clinicians require that the product provide good suction control and ease of tool changes.  The port connects to standard suction lines.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (5) patients.
c.	Evaluator will determine if the suction control is easy to use with single-handed operation and tool changes. 

3.	 (Patient Safety) The suction toothbrush removes dental plaque, debris and oral secretions and the suction swab removes debris and secretions between brushings. 
a.	Clinicians require that the product effectively removes dental plaque, debris and oral secretions.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (5) patients.
c.	The evaluator will examine the patients mouth with the naked eye and determine if there is any visible plaque and/or debris on the tongue and teeth.  

4.	 (Patient Safety) The covered yankauer removes debris and secretions and when the system
is closed, the protective sleeve contains oral secretions and protects the yankauer from 
environmental debris.
a.	Clinicians require that the product remove debris and secretions to prevent or reduce bacterial colonization in the mouth and on the surface of the teeth.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (5) patients.
c.	The evaluator will observe the condition of the patients oral cavity before cleansing with the product and after the product has been used to gage cleanliness and absence of secretions. 
d.	The evaluator will retract the protective sleeve to help contain secretions and protect the yankauer from environmental debris.

Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified/invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Northeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). 

The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three one year (12 months) option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.   Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Northeast Region are considered more important than other pricing elements.

<p>Synopsis: <br />The business opportunities described in this notice are joint ventures, require investments by prospective organizations and provide a revenue sharing opportunity. The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) enters into joint ventures in accordance with the authority granted to NTIS in the National Technical Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 3704b) and in accordance with the guidelines published in the June 13, 1989 Federal Register.</p>
<p>The NTIS, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is seeking information for potential joint venture relationships that can complement existing NTIS information acquisition, dissemination, and archival capabilities. The potential joint venture candidate(s) would work with NTIS to deliver innovative solutions that increase the performance and effectiveness of NTIS and its content providers in the dissemination of government-sponsored scientific, technical, engineering and related business content. The joint venture(s) could also assist NTIS in supporting other federal agencies with their information preservation and dissemination missions and information challenges brought on by new digital and network-related technologies (e.g. web, archiving, preservation, metrics, social networking and collaborative technologies). Prospective participant(s) could provide one or more new media-related solutions that support digital, computerized, or networked information and communication technologies.</p>
<p>NTIS has extensive expertise in the dissemination of government-sponsored information to the public, as well as providing secure, large-scale, high-volume, web-based, and innovative technology solutions to government clients. The proposed joint venture(s) would serve the public, and may offer new technologies to the federal agencies that NTIS supports. As NTIS operates on a cost-recovery basis, responses should address proposed business terms for revenue sharing between NTIS and the joint venture candidate. A successful arrangement will demonstrate the benefits of collaboration between the private sector and NTIS.</p>
<p>NTIS expects to provide personnel, hardware, IT services, hosting facilities, security, program management, and product development support functions to each joint venture. The solutions provided by the candidate(s) will enable each joint venture to provide customized, large-scale, high-volume, integrated; secure new media solutions for use by NTIS and other federal agencies that NTIS supports.</p>
<p>Responses should address innovative new media solutions and knowledge management technologies and address one or more of the following categories:</p>
<p>&bull; Content Development (e.g.: data harvesting, scanning, and digitization)<br />&bull; Information Dissemination (e.g., metadata and full-text content (text, images, and data))<br />&bull; Data Permanence and Archival Issues <br />&bull; Performance Requirements and Metrics<br />&bull; Delivery Platforms<br />&bull; Security (including content authentication)<br />&bull; Technological Innovation (including information and communication technologies)<br />&bull; Accessibility - Section 508 Compliance</p>
<p>Joint ventures are not procurements. A participant is expected to develop fully compliant and integrated new media solutions in a premier environment that supports development of the federal workforce, advances the accomplishment of agency missions, and meets all government technical requirements. NTIS envisions the participation of one or more companies. The end result of these joint ventures may be products or services.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI must describe and reference the technical capabilities of the products proposed for use, describe the candidate's technical expertise and provide a concise description of the candidate's existing experience and ability to provide NTIS with any necessary technical training in the use of the products.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI may include proposed teams of more than one firm. Any proposed arrangements should describe how they would function. Respondents to the RFI may be invited to make oral presentations.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that each future joint venture will be a revenue sharing agreement which will provide returns to the successful party or parties. Anticipated revenue streams may be addressed in the response.</p>
<p>Prospective candidates should limit their submissions to ten (10) pages, excluding graphic appendices. Responses must be in writing. Candidates must provide an electronic or hard-copy response to Donald H. Hagen, Associate Director, Office of Product Management and Acquisitions at the "Place of Performance" address below by the response date specified in this announcement. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to choose which firms to contact based on the quality of the submissions and the current fit with NTIS organizational and customer needs.</p>
<p>Interested parties may contact: Donald H. Hagen, Associate Director, Office of Product Management and Acquisitions, Fax (703) 605-6387, Email: dhagen@ntis.gov.<br />Place of Performance: <br />Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service<br />5301 Shawnee Road<br />Alexandria, VA<br />22312</p>

<CONTACT>Mike Kilbane
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey for the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) X-Band Radar.
AMDR is envisioned as a radar suite designed to be scalable to accommodate current and future mission requirements for multiple platforms. AMDR will consist of an S-band radar (AMDR-S), an X-band radar (AMDR-X) and a Radar Suite Controller (RSC). The AMDR-S will provide volume search, tracking, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) discrimination, and missile communications. The AMDR-X will provide horizon search, periscope detection and discrimination, surface search, precision tracking, missile communication and terminal illumination. Both radars will be integrated into a suite by the RSC. The RSC will provide the appropriate interfaces between the AMDR-S, AMDR-X, and combat system. The RSC will perform all coordinating actions to ensure that both radars operate in concert with high effectiveness in a wide diversity of environments and conditions. 
This market survey is seeking interested parties that may have developed or are currently producing solid state X-band radars that have the potential to meet the requirements set forth in the Air & Missile Defense Radar Top Level Radar Performance (TLRP) document for AMDR-X. 
The Government is interested in procuring an X-band radar that has the following attributes:
a.	The AMDR-X performance requirements of the TLRP can be met with little or moderate adaptation, upgrade, modification, or development from an existing demonstrated and tested system.b.	Technology Risks associated with the AMDR-X have been sufficiently reduced such that the radar system or components have achieved a minimum of a Technology Readiness Level of 6.  Technology Readiness Level 6 is achieved when System/subsystem model(s) or prototype(s) have been demonstrated in a relevant environment (Source:  Defense Acquisition Guidebook).  c.	The Radar system and components are designed to meet open standards. All software and firmware is designed as open components and the Government will receive unrestricted or Government Purpose Rights for all software and firmware components.  d.	All hardware modules are designed as open modules at the Lowest Replaceable Unit (LRU) and the Government will receive unrestricted or Government Purpose Rights relating to form, fit, and function for each LRU.e.	All interfaces, both internal and external, are designed to an open standard and the Government will receive unrestricted or Government Purpose Rights for each interface.
The AMDR-X TLRP document is classified at the SECRET/US Only level. This classified document will be supplied on a CD-ROM which will be mailed separately. Only one copy of the classified CD-ROM will be distributed per cleared respondent. To obtain this classified document, interested offerors must completely fill out the "Classified Material Request Form for AMDR-X RFI" which is attached to this sources sought notice. This information should be submitted to Brian Wessmiller via e-mail at brian.wessmiller@navy.mil with a copy to mike.kilbane@navy.mil and richelle.wright@navy.mil. Once approved, the Government will be able to mail a classified CD to the respondent.
White paper responses to this RFI may be up to the GENSER SECRET level and not exceed 50 pages. The overall page count limitation applies to all subparagraphs below except where noted in subparagraph (e).  Interested sources possessing the capacity to deliver an AMDR-X meeting the conditions outlined above and in the associated performance requirements document are requested to provide White Papers.  White paper responses should describe the approach to meet the aforementioned requirements and attributes as well as the following items:
a.	Provide a performance requirements compliance matrix documenting the proposed system's ability to meet the individual AMDR-X TLRP requirements.   Identify which capabilities have been demonstrated.  While part of the white paper response, the matrix will not be included in the white paper page count.b.	Provide an assessment of the associated risks for the program and respective risk mitigation approaches.c.	For any AMDR-X TLRP performance requirement or functionality that would require adaptation, upgrade, modification or development beyond what exists in the base system provide associated estimated cost and schedule for this effort.d.	Provide complete descriptions of the proposed system. This description must include sufficient documentation to support any claims that the system performance will meet the capabilities contained in the specification.  e.	Identify current system developmental status and location where the Government can witness a demonstration or display of your proposed system or system components. The current status may be documented by providing technical specifications, product literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or any other data to support the state of system development.  These artifacts are in addition to the white paper and will not be included in its page count.f.	Corporate capabilities (i.e., available facilities and assets to include existing production facilities, total available square footage to include additional floor space available for expansion; quality management programs, manufacturing process controls and configuration management control systems) and company profile (i.e., company type, US or non-US ownership, Cage code, DUNs number, size and status as listed in the Central Contractor Registration) should be provided.
White paper responses are due by 09 January 2010 to Mike Kilbane at the address listed below.  If the response is unclassified, it may be submitted via email at mike.kilbane@navy.mil.  The Government may elect to conduct one-on-one discussions with industry based on its analysis of the RFI responses, the quality of the submission, and the level and specification of the information provided.  Please note that the Government is under no obligation to conduct these sessions.  RFI responses may ultimately result in the Government developing and issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to respondents.  However, the Government is under no obligation to issue an RFP.

<SUBJECT>Testing of Collector Systems
<SOLNBR>RFI-AH1
<RESPDATE>113009
<ARCHDATE>12302009
<CONTACT>Janet Herman, Phone 202-254-6918, Email janet.herman@dhs.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br />Testing of Collector Systems to maintain Biological Agent Viability<br /><br />1. Reference Number: DHSSTCHEMBIO2009RFIAH1<br /><br />2. Response Due Date: 30 November 2009, 1700 E.S.T. to rfi-ah1@hq.dhs.gov <br /><br />3. Synopsis:<br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate is seeking mature aerosol collection systems to participate in a laboratory test to: (1) determine collection system efficiency over a range of particle sizes, and (2) quantify the ability of the system to maintain the viability of collected biological materials.
<p>This is NOT a Request for Quotation. Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. Selection of respondents for participation in the laboratory test will be based on review and assessment of the response submission and how well the material meets the specified requirements, as well as on aerosol chamber capacity and testing team resources. The review and assessment will be performed by DHS federal and contractor support personnel. All contractor support personnel shall be bound by non-disclosure agreements. <br /><br />4. Background:<br />The Chemical and Biological Research &amp; Development Branch within DHS S&amp;T Directorate needs to continuously collect viable aerosol samples from the environment to support the mission of comprehensive analysis of bio-terrorism attacks. These viable aerosol samples will be analyzed in the laboratory for antibiotic resistance and susceptibility determinations, along with other functional tests, to augment the existing DHS Office of Health Affairs (OHA) BioWatch program detection capabilities.</p>
<p>To support the collector system development effort initiated under Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 09-08 (see https://baa.st.dhs.gov for reference), DHS S&amp;T is developing a test bed and series of protocols to measure aerosol collector system efficiency and viability metrics for collected biological materials. As part of this effort, DHS S&amp;T will host a test opportunity for mature aerosol collection technologies using this new test plan and set of protocols. This test will provide DHS S&amp;T with an assessment of the capabilities of mature aerosol collection systems, as well as an assessment of the test procedures. To participate in this aerosol collector system test opportunity, DHS S&amp;T is requesting responses to this RFI for systems which meet the requirements listed in Section 6 below. <br /><br />5. Testing Opportunity:<br />The test will be held at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory campus in Laurel, Maryland, and is anticipated to occur in February 2010 over two weeks (8 working days). The systems will be tested using the Dynamic Continuous Aerosol Generator (DyCAG) in a BSL-2 aerosol chamber environment.</p>
<p>Collector systems will be exposed to:<br />1. Fluorescent polystyrene spheres ranging in size from 0.5 - 8 &micro;m diameter.<br />2. Biological materials representing spore, vegetative cell, and viral threats. These materials will be presented as aerosol particles with a number mean diameter of between 2 and 8 microns, and the initial viable fraction of the disseminated material will be determined.</p>
<p>Data will be analyzed to determine:<br />1. Collector efficiency as a function of particle size. <br />2. Viability of biological material eluted from the collector system. Collected samples will be stored and maintained on-board the collector system until eluted. Analysis of viability will be performed immediately after collection, as well as 2 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after collection.</p>
<p>Participants in the test will be responsible for:<br />1. All equipment, personnel, transportation and consumable costs for the operation of their system throughout the test.<br />2. Protocols for extracting viable samples off the collection system must be delivered to the testing team at least 30 days prior to the start of the testing period. Any proprietary procedures or materials necessary for the sample extraction must be supplied to the testing team.</p>
<p>NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE PROVIDED TO TEST PARTICIPANTS.</p>
<p>DHS S&amp;T will ONLY provide: <br />1. Access to the testing facility during the specified test period.<br />2. Challenge materials used during the test.</p>
<p>Additional details of the tests will be provided to selected systems developers prior to entry into the test chamber. Due to security restrictions, foreign nationals are not permitted in the JHU/APL Biological and Aerosol labs. All contractor personnel to support the test on-site at JHU/APL should be U.S. citizens with appropriate identification. In addition, before participating in the test, system developers shall be required to sign a vendor agreement (see attached). <br /><br />Following the test, DHS S&amp;T will provide the independent laboratory data to collector system developers on the performance of their system. Participation in this test does not guarantee further participation by the system developer in the development of a technology solution for DHS S&amp;T for viable bioaerosol collection systems, nor does non-participation in the test preclude further participation in the development of a technology solution.</p>
<p>6. Collector System Requirements/Technical Specifications: <br />In order to be considered for participation in this test, the aerosol collector system must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Maximum system footprint: 36"x48"<br />2. Available Power: 110 or 220, 30A, multiple circuits<br />3. Maximum system flow rate: 1000 lpm<br />4. TRL: 7 or greater<br />5. Autonomous collection and storage of samples for at least 2 days on the collection system.<br />6. Elution of collected samples into a storage container which has demonstrated a reasonable expectation of maintaining the viability of spore, vegetative cells and viruses for several days. <br /><br />7. Response Submission Guidelines:<br />Responses shall be no more than 10 single-sided pages on 8.5x11" paper. Responses should be sent as .doc or .pdf files, with a maximum size of 10 MB, to RFI-AH1@hq.dhs.gov by the due date listed in Section 2 above.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to SureWorks, LLc, 1607 Ervine Avenue, Longmont, CO 80501. This requirement is for software/electrical engineering support to develop software and computer programming related to the development of enhancements to a boat-towed video imaging system to enumerate and identify small fishes in highly turbid and high velocity water conditions.  The imaging system development includes fabricating second-generation waterproof camera housing, computer-camera interface communication, and a LabVIEW-based computer vision system and associated add-on Vision Development Module from information learned during laboratory and field testing during the previous year.  The software engineer must be familiar with LabView software, computer-controlled lighting, overall electronic configurations, turbidity reduction, and fish recognition.  The ship-borne computer/data acquisition system will need to display real-time images, computational object recognition results, counts, and graphs, and record only instances with detected visual events.  The software must be able to perform filtering, object detection, event detection, recording events (volatile memory to storage transfer), measuring and converting image-centric measurements to real-world units.  Ultimately, this system and software components must be user-friendly to enable non-programmers to make complex software changes without the need for a dedicated software engineer. The developed video imaging system will need to be tested under simulated trawl conditions in the hydraulic flumes at Reclamation's Denver Hydraulics Laboratory and in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. An understanding of water conditions, targeted fishes, and local natural resource agencies of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is required.
The proposed contractor, SureWorks, LLc., has been working over the past year developing and testing a submersible device that uses a video imaging system to identify and count objects (fish) in turbid water.  They have investigated video imaging limitations under simulated mid-water trawl conditions in a recirculating enclosed system, flumes at Reclamation's Denver Hydraulics Laboratory, and in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.  They have performed analyses under a range of turbidities found in the Delta (0-60 NTU, nephelometric turbidity units), which is the primary limiting factor for performing video recognition in these waters.  SureWorks has designed, fabricated, and tested an underwater housing to attach to the cod-end of a towed-net and perform under strict buoyancy, pitch, yaw, and roll specifications.  The device has been tested in flows up to 0.9 m/sec.  They have also configured two high-speed cameras mounted along with electrical components between the inner acrylic hull and the aluminum outer hull that provide simultaneous horizontal and vertical video streams along with a complex lighting system.  The electrical system (lighting, light driving, sensor sampling, cameras, camera power, lightning protection, and smaller subsystems, GPS location, pressure for depth (inner and outer), humidity, temperature (air inside hull), water flow rate (from pressure differential), and tilt angle (and rate) from accelerometers) has been constructed and tested and is working according to specification.	The software system that SureWorks has designed and assembled is nearly complete and requires additional work on the vision algorithm and some flume testing for usability and data flow.  SureWorks has designed a software system comprising of a user interface that includes data visualization, sensor acquisition, alarming conditions, camera inputs, and data recording, along with a vision algorithm that is actively detecting fish-sized objects using CUDA algorithms for parallel computational elements to accelerate applications, in our case, a background subtraction algorithm.
Competition is restricted to only one source under the authority of the commercial item test program found at FAR 13.501(a). This procurement will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures at FAR Part 13 with an intended performance period of November 30, 2009 - September 30, 2010. Anticipated award date is November 30, 2009. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal by 2:00 pm MST, November 13, 2009, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to this notice shall be submitted to Rob Brackett, Contract Specialist via email to rbrackett@usbr.gov

<DESC>RE:  DOI AQD Solicitation No. N10PX18120 - ASACS
This notice is being posted under the Franchise Authority of the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate for the four component military services of the Department of Defense (US Air Force, US Army, US Navy and the US Marine Corps). This requirement is for medical and psychological counseling services to be provided to adolescents residing on U. S. military bases overseas.  Adolescents under counseling frequently have committed offenses that can result their own and their family's removal from overseas bases, the ruining of careers, prosecutions, and other legal ramifications. The counselors are hired to be experts and neutral participants in government programs to reduce drug abuse and related socially undesirable behavior. The host governments of the countries where the counselors work, have currently approved the counselors being "stationed" under the auspices of the Forces in their countries. Under the terms of the Status of Force Agreements, the host countries have the right to approve and disapprove who can practice medicine on their territories and what U. S. companies may operate under the  umbrella of the U.S. forces and be exempt from host nation licensing, taxation, residency requirements, etc.  The terms of the Status of Forces Agreements limit potential sources by the very existence of the requirement for the host country's approval of the contractor as a provider of technical experts and for its approval of particular individual employees to be considered as assimilated "members of the civilian component of the sending state's forces". It is a costly and time consuming enterprise to secure host country approvals for technical experts to be permitted to be in host countries as assimilated members of the U. S. Forces overseas. In cases where difficulties arise and the host country takes objection to a firm or an objection to one or more of its proposed employees, the process can take an enormous amount of time to acquire these approvals or supply acceptable replacement personnel. Therefore, the counselors must currently be acceptable to host governments as members of the civilian component of the U. S. Force to practice without local licenses under provisions of their treaties. Additionally, the counselors must be US-licensed medical practitioners who are trained to deal with adolescents and who are experienced in military environments outside of the United States.The current order for the provision of these services will lapse on December 31, 2009.  The government wishes to recompete the long term requirement and award an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity service contract in the open market in calendar year 2010.  A separate announcement will be posted in the near future pertaining to the recomplete.  In order to have time to complete the competition for the longer-term acquisition, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate an interim, short term order for a six month period with SAIC as a logical follow-on to the previously competed effort, in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.  SAIC currently has these capabilities and the required approvals under the treaties. No other company providing similar services is known to currently have these required approvals and/or capabilities. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities regarding this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement to the contracting officer by the date specified below. The issuer of the capabilities statement must certify qualification under the NAICS code appropriate for this work. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 621420 - Outpatient Mental Health and Substance Abuse Centers. The deadline for submission of questions regarding this notice is Thursday, November 12, 2009. Questions will be answered by Friday, November 13, 2009. The Government reserves the right to transmit all questions and answers to all other interested parties. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE ANSWERED OR ADDRESSED. Submit inquiries and final capabilities statements by email to Leonard.Nadybal@aqd.nbc.gov.  Any award made pursuant to this notice is subject to receipt of the required agency administrative approvals and availability of funds. The Government will consider all capabilities statements received by Monday, November 16, 2009. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<SOLNBR>N0016410SNB04
<ARCHDATE>11252009
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:julie.wittmer@navy.mi">POINT OF CONTACT</a>
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit interests and information from sources in regards to Production and Sustainment of the Ground Based Operational Surveillance System (G-BOSS).  The producer will manufacture finished G-BOSS systems that include Government Furnished Materiel (GFM) and materiel procured or fabricated by the producer.  The GFM will include optical sensors, ground based radar, generators, and radios.  The producer will be responsible for providing functional performing systems, sub-assembly, the fabrication of cabling, mechanical and electrical interface components; and will be responsible for the procurement and supply chain management of commercial materiel final system assembly of all components, final system test, and packaging, handling, and transport of the final system to designated facilities.  A comprehensive Government owned Technical Data Package (TDP) will be provided to industry upon issuance of an official solicitation for production and sustainment services.   System software will be Government Furnished Software (GFS) installed by the producer.  G-BOSS system sustainment will include program management of logistics program, Field Service Representative (FSR) support for Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) operations including current Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) operation, depot support services for the operational system including system installation, repair/replace/refurbish of the full system and/or sub-systems, and supply chain management for non-GFM components,  operator and maintenance training, data collection, reporting, and distribution, monitoring, and process improvements to maintain and improve operational availability and reliability.  It is anticipated that the production and sustainment activities will be provided with performance incentives.
The G-BOSS is an expeditionary, ground-based, self-contained, multi-spectral sensor-oriented, persistent surveillance system. An expeditionary nature is a critical aspect of the G-BOSS. Its expeditionary nature allows it to deploy via various modes of transportation (air, land, sea) ensuring world-wide deployability.  Major strategic sensors and integration technical data package will be supplied to the producer and sustainment provider as GFM/GFI.The G-BOSS will be employed in three configurations supporting the Department of Defense: Light (man-transportable), Medium (light trailer/vehicle), and Heavy (large tower trailer) variants. The Light variant provides short-range, close in surveillance support and will be transported in multiple transit cases. The Medium variant provides longer range surveillance support and will be transported, as its description indicates, using a light trailer (such as the M923) or tactical vehicle (such as the HMMWV). The Heavy variant provides surveillance support of a more permanent nature.  There will be a fourth variant for non-DoD use that will be similar in configuration to the Medium variant.It is anticipated that future evolutionary versions may be required.The aggregate number of all G-BOSS variants produced will be up to 600 systems over 5 years with sustainment activities supporting up to 750 units by year 5.
Intent:  Length/Type of Contract(s): Production and Sustainment Contract(s) are expected to be Firm Fixed Price with performance incentives up to five (5) years in duration.Goals: Production goals are expected to meet staged delivery schedules over 5 years beginning with system deliveries in FY2011 with expected continual improvements in efficiency and quality of manufacturing and testing.  Expected performance results from the sustainment effort include continual improvements in processes and efficiencies in sustainment that reduce overall cost to the Government, minimizes logistics footprint and response time, and maximizes operational availability and operational reliability.  
Measurements: Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number AG6538S10AA07 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2005-32. The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 541690 and 541711.<br />CLIN 1 - QTY 1 - Illumina Ovine SNP50 Bead array genotyping on 138 sheep DNA samples
<p>The goal of this project is identify regions of the sheep genome associated with ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP), a disease caused by ovine lentiviral infection.  DNA from 69 pairs of contemporary sheep (infect/uninfected) will be genotyped with a set of 50,000 DNA markers that are evenly distributed across the genome (Illumina OvineSNP50 Genotyping Beadchip).  Because the pairs are matched for breed, gender, age, year of birth, line, flock history, and etc., those sheep resistant to infection may have an abundance of certain alleles not commonly found in their diseased flock mates.  These alleles may have predictive value for US sheep producers.</p>
<p>Identifying DNA markers associated with OPP resistance supports the USDA, ARS Animal Health National Program mission to deliver effective solutions to prevent and control animal diseases that impact agriculture. This also supports USMARC mission to develop scientific information and new technology to solve high priority problems for the U.S. sheep industry, and Animal Health Research Unit mission to understand the interactions between infectious agents and domestic livestock. These interactions are important because they may result in disease and loss of production.  Reducing the impact of infectious diseases improves animal and public health.</p>
<p>Technical requirements</p>
<p>The provider must provide genotypes for 138 USMARC sheep for same single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that are currently on the Illumina OvineSNP50 Genotyping Beadchip. These SNP markers are currently the global industry standard for ovine DNA genotyping and have been previously used on a reference set of USMARC sheep.  All resulting genotypes must be returned to USMARC.</p>
<p>CCR and ORCA: Vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) and Online Representation and Certifications (ORCA) prior to the award of the contract. You may register by going to www.ccr.gov. You will need to your Tax ID, Duns Number, Bradstreet number and banking information.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br /></strong>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates four DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It has been determined that one of these DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft will be based out of the Hyannis, MA area to be operated in support of critical marine mammal surveys, law enforcement and marine sanctuary related research. Due to winter weather conditions in the Hyannis area, it is necessary that the Twin Otter aircraft be kept in a hangar during the period December 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010. The hangar will protect the aircraft from the environment as well as protect the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post-flight activities through the winter months.</p>
<p>SCOPE: <br />NOAA Twin Otter aircraft will be operating out of Hyannis, MA in support of marine mammal surveys in the Atlantic Ocean. There will be a NOAA Twin Otter mechanic in Hyannis supporting the aircraft at all times except for short periods when the mechanic's services are requested to support aircraft in other locations. Only one Twin Otter is required in the hangar at one time. However, if maintenance or equipment installation is required, there may be a request to shift one aircraft out on the ramp to allow another one access.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide heated hangar space for one (1) DHC-6 Twin Otter having a wing span of 65 feet and 19 feet high at the tail. Heated hangar means that the hangar is maintained at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the aircraft is stored.</p>
<p>Security clause 1352.239-73 does not apply to the SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The following services are requested as part of the hangar rental price. If there are extra charges or fees for any of these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental price, provide separate pricing information for each item:</p>
<p>1) Ground support equipment use including:<br />a) DC external power unit,<br />b) Ground service equipment on an as needed basis,<br />c) Tow vehicle for aircraft movement in and out of hangar. <br />2) Hangar amenities including: tools, equipment, consumables, phones, heat and DC power,<br />3) 24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew,<br />4) Storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment 5 ft x 5 ft,<br />5) Acceptance of Multiservice Air Card for payment of incidentals.</p>
<p>b) PERFORMANCE PERIOD. The hangar lease is required from December 1, 2009 thru March 31, 2010. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site and from use of the hangar without incurring any additional fees or penalties associated with departing earlier than March 31, 2010. At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>c) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

*****PLEASE NOTE******
THIS CONTRACT REQUIRES (2) 1463 cube Truck. One Truck has to have a 4000 pound Lift gate at the tail end of the truck.



Enclosed please find the formal solicitation package you requested. The Postal Service has determined that Highway Contract Route (HCR) transportation services will no longer be advertised to the public as an Invitation to Bid. Accordingly, this solicitation is being offered to the public as a Request for Proposal. There are significant changes in this process. Some of these changes are as follows:

1. As stated under Clause 2.2.8 in the Terms and Conditions, the Postal Service has implemented a program under which postal highway contract route (HCR) suppliers will obtain fuel at certain designated wholesale fuel servicing facilities and retail fuel servicing facilities; all suppliers are required to participate in the Fuel Management Program (see the Fuel Management Program document enclosed dated February 11, 2009). For evaluation purposes, the contract baseline fuel price per gallon will be determined by the Contracting Officer based on the fueling locations provided by the HCR supplier on the enclosed Fuel Purchase Form (HC 131). The contracting officer will use the average quarterly Department of Energy Regional Fuel Index cost per gallon on the solicitation closing date to evaluate proposals (based on the Fuel Purchase Form submitted). For bulk fuel purchases, the quarterly average USPS Bulk Fuel Program Price Per Gallon will be used for proposal evaluation. Therefore, for line 6 (fuel) on Form 7468A, Highway Transportation Contract  Bid or Renewal Worksheet, the supplier should include the number of gallons only; the cost per gallon and total cost should be set to zero ($0.00).

2. All parties submitting a proposal will continue to receive a formal notification of contract award. The notification will identify the successful vendor and price.

<p>a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.<br />b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.<br />c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br />8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI.

To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.<br />9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.<br />10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005) <br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-</p>
<p>(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or <br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).<br />(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.</p>
<p>b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any</p>
<p>(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.</p>
<p>f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.</p>
<p>g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (JAN 2005) Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Not withstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein.

HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees.<br />16. MODIFICATIONS (JAN 2005) No agreement or understanding to modify this contract will be binding upon the NAFI unless made in writing and signed by a Contracting Officer from the office that issued the contract or its successor.<br />17. TAXES (JAN 2005) <br />a. Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.</p>
<p>b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.</p>
<p>18. PROOF OF SHIPMENT (JAN 2005) (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.)<br />a. Notwithstanding any clause of this contract to the contrary, payment will be made for items not yet received, upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by an appropriate proof of shipment. If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.</p>
<p>b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.</p>
<p>c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.</p>
<p>19.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

As used in this clause:<br />Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.<br />Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.<br />Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-<br />(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;<br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-<br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or<br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and<br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.<br />Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:<br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).<br />(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.<br />(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] <br />[ ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. <br />[ ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />o TIN: ________________________________. <br />o TIN has been applied for. <br />o TIN is not required because: <br />o Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />o Sole proprietorship; <br />o Partnership; <br />o Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />o Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />o Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />o Foreign government; <br />o International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />o Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />o Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />o Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p><br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 19 November, 2009 at 4:30 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 20 November, 2009. Contact Debora Plymel at 252-334-5372 or debora.j.plymel@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation.

Basis for Award <BR>The Government intends to award one, or up to four contracts to the Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value to the Government.  Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Governments estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.<BR><BR>In determining best value, the Government will consider the following three evaluation factors: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Price. The relative order of importance of the evaluation factors is as follows: Technical Approach is more important than Past Performance. The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR>2. Factors and Subfactors to be Evaluated <BR><BR>Factor 1  Technical Approach<BR>	Subfactor 1.1  Design<BR>	Subfactor 1.2  Schedule<BR><BR>Factor 2  Past Performance<BR><BR>Factor 3  Price <BR><BR>NOTE: Technical Subfactors are listed in order of relative importance; Design is more important than Schedule.<BR><BR>3. Evaluation Approach <BR>All proposals will be evaluated by a team of Government employees using a two-phase down-select process, conducted as follows: <BR><BR>In Phase I, proposals will be evaluated and down-selected with a best-value trade-off process on the two non-price factors: Technical Approach and Past Performance. Offerors whose proposals are down-selected in Phase I will be invited to conduct a site visit of the office space in Milford, MA and will be permitted to take measurements of the site and to revise their proposal pricing on the basis of those measurements. Offerors are responsible for verifying all dimensions of the site. <BR><BR>In Phase II, the Government will evaluate the Price factor of the down-selected proposals. Any revised pricing will be taken into consideration in Phase II. Each down-selected proposals price factor will be considered in relation to its non-price factors. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR><BR>(V) ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES.<BR><BR>52.252-1     SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)<BR>This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

Please clarify what is meant by A-grade and B-grade. <BR>ANSWER: A-Grade refers to the best possible product line available, given the Rough Order of Magnitude of this project. B-Grade refers to an alternative product line which, while not necessarily equal to the A-grade product line, still achieves the design objectives desired by the Government.<BR><BR>2. What is the floor-to-ceiling height of the space? <BR>ANSWER: The floor-to-ceiling height of the space is approximately 96 inches. Please see the revised Exhibit A, available at https://www3.natick.army.mil/current.cfm or by email from john.conlin3@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>3. In Room 5 (and in all rooms), Will the data outlet be relocated or is this to be wireless?<BR>ANSWER: Existing data and phone outlets in all rooms will be relocated by the Government to accommodate the successful Offerors (or Offerors) design.<BR><BR>4.

What is the hierarchical relationship of the personnel who will work in these offices?<BR>ANSWER: Personnel who will occupy the Executive Suite (Rooms 1-7) will be senior management.

Power to be at desk height or at base level?<BR>ANSWER: Either, or both, configurations would be acceptable.<BR><BR>10. Does your group work with oversize documents?<BR>ANSWER: No. The personnel occupying these offices will be working with standard sized documents.<BR><BR>11. Please confirm typical equipment requirements for each station: Monitor (flat panel?) CPU and keyboard tray?  Do some users have multiple monitors?  Perhaps a monitor arm in each station?  <BR>ANSWER: All personnel who will work in these offices will use dual flat-panel monitors.

If true floor-to-ceiling panels are proposed, will the Offeror be able to coordinate with the property manager to properly arrange HVAC? <BR>ANSWER: No. Offerors whose proposals are downselected for Phase 2 evaluation will have an opportunity to visit the installation site and adjust their proposed layouts to accommodate the existing HVAC. Offerors will then be able to revise their pricing accordingly, before submitting a revised final proposal for Phase 2 evaluation.<BR><BR>2. Are all four of the higher walled stations together, or two for Room 8 and two for Room 10? <BR>ANSWER: There should be at least one high walled work station in Room 8 and one in Room 10.

The Government will be responsible for configuring electrical hook-ups to accommodate the successful Offeror(s).<BR><BR>8. CLIN 0002 requests that no stations be laid out in front of the floor to ceiling windows in Room 10, but is this flexible in any way?  <BR>ANSWER: The Government prefers that these windows not be blocked.

For the modular systems furniture, does the Government prefer monolithic or segmented Panels?<BR>ANSWER: Offerors may propose either kind, according to what they determine is the best overall design solution for the Government.

Do you mean you want glass on top of the wood or laminate as a protection or do you mean you want a desk composed of glass tops that you actually see through?  <BR>ANSWER: The Governments preference for glass tops on work surfaces should be interpreted as a piece of glass laid on top of a work surface for protection. <BR><BR><BR>Questions Concerning CLIN 0002<BR><BR>1. Is it desirable to have the floor-to-ceiling workstations next to the exterior walls, or is that not desirable?  <BR>ANSWER: The Government does not have a general preference for one layout over another.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NOTICE: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is SAQMMA10M0030 and is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-36. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334510 with a small business size standard of 500.00 employees. This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids. The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2009-11-12 11:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com. FOB Destination shall be Arlington , VA 22209<BR><BR>The Department of State requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, M295 decontamination kits: The M-295 Decontamination Kit allows personnel to decontaminate individual equipment through physical removal and absorption of chemical agents. The kit consists of a pouch containing four individual wipe-down mitts enclosed in a soft protective packet. The packet is designed to fit comfortably within a pocket of the battle dress over-garment. Each mitt is comprised of a decontaminating powder contained within a nonwoven polyester material and a polyethylene film backing, which allows the powder to flow freely when in use. Decontamination is accomplished through using both the nonwoven polyester pad and the decontaminating powder., 40, EA;<BR>LI 002, M256A1 detector kits: Used to detect and identify blood, blister and nerve agents present either as liquid or as vapor. May be used to determine when it is safe to unmask, to locate and identify chemical hazards (reconnaissance), and to monitor decontamination effectiveness. The M256 is not an alarm; it is a tool used after an individual has received other warnings about the possible presence of chemical warfare agents, and have responded by putting on their chemical protective clothing., 50, EA;<BR>LI 003, M256A1 training kit:  A M256A1 trainer simulator was developed to provide realistic training while avoiding unnecessary exposure to potentially carcinogenic reagents in the M256A1 detector kit. The M256A1 trainer contains 36 pre-engineered detector tickets and an instruction booklet. The pre-engineered detector tickets show color changes comparable to those seen when the M256A1 detector kit is used in clean or contaminated environments.Agents Detected:	Hydrogen Cyanide / AC / Blood (cyanide) 	Cyanogen Chloride / CK / Blood (cyanide) 	Mustard / H / Blister 	Nitrogen Mustard / HN / Blister 	Distilled Mustard / HD / Blister 	Phosgene Oxime / CX / Blister 	Lewsite / L / Blister 	Nerve Agents / V and G / Nerve, 75, EA;<BR>LI 004, M8 paper:  The M8 paper is used to test liquid substances for the presence of nerve agents and blister agents. It is similar to the litmus (pH) paper that is found in almost any laboratory in that a test result is indicated in both types of paper by a change in color. The difference is that M8 paper is specifically designed (dye-impregnated) to react to nerve agents and blister agents in liquid form (M8 Paper is also issued to soldiers as a separate piece of chemical detection equipment). The soldier blots the M8 paper on a suspected liquid agent and observes for color change. There is a color chart inside the front cover of the booklet for comparison. The M8 paper comes in 4 x 2.5 booklets, each containing 25 sheets of detector paper., 50, EA;<BR>LI 005, Nerve Agent Vapor Detector (NAVD):  Detector is a simple, inexpensive, expendable device designed for the individual soldier to detect nerve gas vapors. The detectors can be used to quickly determine if a chemical attack detected by a gas alarm system is dangerous in the immediate vicinity of the individual or when it is safe to unmask. NAVD Nerve Agent Vapor Detector consists of: A plastic detector body containing an enzyme impregnated test paper & instruction sheet; a plastic holder containing a chemically impregnated test paper. Testing Procedure: 1. moisten the test paper in the detector body and expose it to the atmosphere. 2. Press the detector body into the holder so that the papers contact. The test paper will change color to blue or green in absence of nerve agent vapor. If nerve agent vapor is present or the test has been incorrectly performed, the color of the test paper will remain unchanged., 50, EA;<BR>LI 006, First Responder Safety Scissors:  Precision cut paramedic shears made of hardened stainless steel give unsurpassed performance under the most demanding conditions. The serrated edges of these medical scissors assist in the cutting of the toughest materials. Blunt tip protects against skin abrasions., 50, EA; <BR><BR>For this solicitation, Department of State intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<DESC>A001: Questions and Response

A001:

Question:

1. Section 1 - SOW indicates "In addition, the selected contractor will investigate additional opportunities for US TDA funding in Turkey's geothermal sector.  In addition to the Turkey proposal, USTDA expects to receive additional information regarding potential geothermal projects with Kayi Energy, BM Holding, Enda Energy and possibly others".

Reviewing projects for each of the above Turkish companies will significantly raise the level of effort required to carry out the DM and preparation of a final report.  Can you specify exactly how many companies and projects (and which projects) the Turkey DM assignment will include?

Response:

1) There are many private sector Turkish companies with interest in developing geothermal projects.  The selected DM contractor will have to evaluate several potential projects in order to determine which, if any, meet USTDA's funding criteria.  Only those projects that meet our funding criteria will require further investigation, including the development of TORs and full write-ups in the final report.  

Question:

2. The FedBizOpps website indicates the "The Governments estimate for this procurement is $40,000".  However, this figure is not repeated in the DM Solicitation.  Is the $40,000 amount an upper limit on what US TDA will consider for this DM?  Is it meant to cover an analysis and report on the Manisa project only?  Or projects also proposed by the other Turkish companies mentioned above?

Response:
2) The government estimate is an estimate.  It is meant to cover all work that will be completed as part of the DM.

The acquisition of this specific product from this vendor will substantially reduce the risk of substandard patient care and limit the Government's potential liability in instances of substandard care. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c) (1): FAR 6.302-Only one responsible source at this time will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>United States Air Force Academy Soaring ProgramIndustry Day Announcement
The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), United States Air Force Materiel Command, is conducting analyses in support of the non-powered flight capability at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).  As part of these analyses, ASC will be offering an Industry Day on 3 Nov 2009 near Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Fairborn, Ohio at the Tec Edge, Wright Brothers Institute Innovation and Collaboration Center (ICC)(reference map attached in FedBizOps).  The purpose of this event is to communicate with industry the intentions of the potential USAFA glider acquisition, discuss minimum system requirements and receive contractor feedback on these topics.  This Industry Day shall be considered a portion of the market analysis being conducted by ASC.
This effort is for the purchase of a government owned fleet of 19 aircraft suitable for cadet soaring training; 14 dual seat basic gliders and 5 dual seat aerobatic/advanced gliders.  To be considered eligible, all aircraft proposed must be commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) FAA certified aircraft.  Due to the urgency of the timeline, it is preferred that the aircraft supplied be currently in production or in-stock, however, ASC remains open to other suitable acquisition options that are able to meet timeline requirements.  Also, while it is preferred that a single manufacturer provide both the basic and aerobatic aircraft for standardization of training and maintenance purposes, the Air Force is fully dedicated to fair and open competition, and as such there is no requirement that a single manufacturer be able to produce both aircraft.  Support of these aircraft will be handled under a separate contract and is not part of this effort.
Please view the PDF Industry Day Announcement on PIXS for additional information.
Please view the Government Presentation and Q&A documents on PIXS for further information.

<DESC>The Army has developed a reference model for The Army Enterprise Network Operations - NetOps known as The Army LandWarNet NetOps Architecture - LNA providing an objective target for how NetOps will be managed across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>The Army LNA is the baseline enterprise NetOps reference architecture for the Armys LandWarNet.  As an integrated architecture, the LNA provides an enterprise level Army statement of NetOps requirements through the Operational, Systems, and Technical views. These views together depict a holistic approach to NetOps with functional capabilities designed to support NetOps products, software, tools or systems, evaluation/selection.<BR><BR>Achieving NetOps systems interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise Infostructure is challenging due to the extraordinarily large and diverse organizations and existing stove-pipe tools and systems. Standardizing a scalable NetOps toolset is an Army priority.<BR><BR>An optimal way to achieve standardization and increase NetOps systems interoperability and integration is to address the acquisition process.  As a result, it is the intent of the Army to enforce Compliance of the Armys LNA Capabilities into the NetOps systems selection and acquisition process to enhance and ensure interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>Army Regulation (AR) 25-1 mandates the assessment of NetOps products against the architecture to ensure they meet functional and interoperability requirements within the Army Enterprise.  As a part of the Certificate of Networthiness - CoN approval process, all NetOps products - software, tools or systems must be compliant to the LNA.<BR><BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has responsibility to ensure all NetOps products are compliant to the LNA, prior to issuing a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN to acquire, field or connect to the Armys Enterprise.  NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS  utilized on or for the LandWarNet, which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure.  These NetOps products securely manage, operate and maintain the network; they are not the network devices or elements themselves.  NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure.  These NetOps products securely manage, operate and maintain the network; they are not the network devices or elements themselves.<BR><BR>LNA Compliance generally refers to the measurement of a NetOps product in meeting the Army LNA Key Performance Parameters - KPPs and interoperability requirements and standards.  The heart of the LNA Compliance process is the initial product assessment mapping to the LNA Capabilities, validation of the products functional capabilities and data flow interaction with other LNA Capabilities within the LNA.<BR><BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has developed LNA Compliance Checklists for each of the Armys current LNA Capabilities.  Posting of these documents on the FedBizOpps is to provide the criteria required for NetOps products to be compliant to the LNA.  These Checklists are available to Industry, providing vendors the ability to review and perform assessments of their NetOps products against the LNA requirements.  Vendors desiring to access these LNA documents should MAP their NetOps product to the appropriate LNA Capability identified in the LNA Bin Chart <BR><BR>webpage http://www.netcom.army.mil/LNA_Webpage/LNABIN.htm. <BR><BR>For Additional information with LNA document/checklist - See link below<BR><BR>Compliance Checklists exist for each of the current LNA Capabilities and are linked via their respective capability block on the LNA Bin Chart identified above.  To view LNA material related to any particular LNA Capability, click the text in the respective capability block of the LNA Bin Chart.  This links to a Word Document which provides an overview or description of the specific LNA Capability, a graphical representation of the capabilities interface requirements with other LNA capabilities to include data exchanges, and further provides a link to the detailed LNA Compliance Checklists/documents outlining functional and Interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>In order for NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet - LWN, to be considered for selection, Army requiring activities must obtain a Certificate of Networthiness from NETCOM/9th Signal Command, as stated in AR 25-1. See chapters 2-2, 2-15 thru 2-27, and 6-3.  As a part of the CoN approval process, all NetOps products software, tools, or systems must be Compliant to the LNA. <BR><BR>Industry is encouraged to utilize these LNA Checklists to perform a self-assessment of their NetOps products to ensure their products compliance with the Armys LNA Compliance requirements.  <BR><BR>It is recommended Army requiring activities utilize these checklists, as part of their market research, evaluation and acquisition process, for new or enhanced NetOps products, to ensure the products compliance to the LNA prior to seeking a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN from NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>When reviewing or preparing to acquire COTS NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet, Army Requiring Activities should obtain a completed LNA Compliance Checklist, from the vendor, for the LNA capability to which the NetOps product maps.  The completed checklist is the vendors assessment of their products compliance to the LNA and will be viewed as the vendors certification of their NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA functional and interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>Army requiring activities should e-mail completed LNA Compliance Checklist and supporting documentation to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team at compliance.team@conus.army.mil.  Vendors should not directly submit their completed checklists to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team.<BR><BR>These LNA Checklists and supporting documentation will be utilized by the LNA Compliance Team in their assessment of the NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA, prior to a CoN being granted by NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>Prospective procurement of such products will be advertised and procured by Army Agencies requiring products. <BR><BR><BR>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME.<BR>

The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of all items inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN POSTPONED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS SOLICITATION IS BROUGHT FORWARD FROM PREVIOUS SOLICITATION NUMBER DTFH68-09-B-00036.

THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN REOPENED AND WILL BE ADVERTISED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.

PROJECT DETAILS: The project is located within the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge, which is adjacent to the City of Lawton, Oklahoma and the Fort Sill Army Base. 

This project consists of the placement of fills on both sides of an existing 2-mile asphalt paved road (Six Mile Scenic Road) to provide additional width, and the construction of paved shoulders along both sides of the road. A double 10-foot by 5-foot concrete box culvert will be extended in place to match the new widths, along with the construction of new headwalls and wingwalls. Other circular metal culverts along the route will need to be extended. In order to perform the widening, both edges of the existing pavment must be saw cut along most of the length. Also included in the project are the replacement of guardrails and guardrail end terminals, grouted riprap at the culvert extensions, and the replacement of permanent signs. After the widening and paved shoulders are completed, the entire roadway surface will be treated with a 3/8-inch modified slurry seal.

In addition to the road work described above, a prefabricated single span steel pedestrian bridge, 140-feet in length, will be constructed at the Elk Mountain Campground area of the Refuge. Other work associated with the bridge construction includes the removal of an existing small pedestrian bridge in the same area, the placement of loose Class 5 riprap at the new bridge abutments, and the use of concrete formliner, which will be painted, on the bridge abutments. The deck of the new bridge will be poured and finished concrete.

Construction can be performed year-round. The project is anticipated to begin in late summer 2009, and should take six months to complete. The estimated price is between $1 and $2 million.

Tentative advertisement date is November 10, 2009.

<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC).

<DESC>Contract modification was awarded on November 9, 2009 

RECOVERYTHIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ09UA00026.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to ResCare, Inc. under contract number DOLJ09UA00026.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $24,227 to the Homestead Job Corps Centers, operated by ResCare, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceilings for this contract.

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost-Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

The funding is intended to address the following program areas:  1) Career Technical Training Educational Services curriculum and 2) CTST Green Initiative Projects as detailed in Job Corps Curriculum Change Notice 09-01 and Curriculum Change Notice 09-02.  The operator of the Homestead center will utilize these funds to make available additional Career Technical Skills Training opportunities to the students of the Homestead Job Corps Center.  The operator of the Homestead Job Corps Center will not procure the services through subcontracting opportunities.

<DESC>Recovery Action - DUNS 078576738. This modification is issued to obligate American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) of 2009 funds to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for the purpose of providing $120,944.00 in operations funding to Agreement # 20382 CHO ARRA 48C Tax Credit Application to conduct both independent reviews and merit reviews for evaluating and selecting applications in response to IRS Notice 2009-72 titled "Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit." Funding provided under this work authorization is not approved for obligation of any type of support service contract either as a prime or subcontract award.<br /><br />This contract was awarded competitively and this award comprises incremental funding.&nbsp; This is a cost reimbursement contract because the uncertainties of performance of the research and development mission of the laboratory make reasonable estimates of costs necessary for firm, fixed-price contracts impractical.

Currently, there are no other known companies technicallycapable of performing this work or possessing the technology required by the Statement ofWork for this instrument.  Teledyne has demonstrated its technical and on-timecapabilities by satisfactory performance on a previous NASAs GSFC contract similar innature to this procurement.  Any delays in enacting this procurement will have a criticalimpact to the TIRS mission schedule.Due to the required work within the statement of work, the Government found it best toaward a Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract type.	Since the requirement features a lot ofspecifications and development, a FFP contract type was not appropriate.

The contractor also shall implement and execute an industry standard audit program to conduct random reviews of the transactions processed for quality assurance.

The contractor will act independently and not as an agent of the Government, and shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform the Statement of Work.
 
B.	BACKGROUND

On June 24, 2009, the President signed legislation to provide consumers with a financial incentive to trade in older model vehicles for newer, more fuel efficient models.  Under the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act (CARS), consumers would receive a credit of up to $4,500 for trading in older cars and purchasing new vehicles that meet specific qualifying criteria.  The Act established NHTSA as the government agency responsible for administering this program.

Under the statute, NHTSA was required to develop program requirements for reimbursements within 30 days, including defining a system to register dealers and to start accepting "vouchers" for reimbursement.  On July 24, 2009, the agency issued the rule implementing the CARS program and began allowing vehicle dealers to register for the program.  On July 27, 2009, NHTSA began accepting vouchers for reimbursement from dealers.  Within a few days, it became apparent that the program was more popular then anyone had anticipated and that the number of voucher requests would exceed all expectations for the program.  In response to the programs popularity, Congress, with the approval of the President, added $2 billion additional dollars to the program.  Given this additional sum, which allowed more consumers to participate, and the pace with which vehicle dealers submitted vouchers and expected reimbursement as a result, the agency needs additional processing resources to meet all statutory reimbursement requirements.  Specifically, the agency requires contractor support capable of committing a substantial, skilled workforce to process potentially hundreds of thousands of CARS transactions.

After approximately a month, NHTSA received more than 690,000 voucher requests, accounting for almost $2.9 billion.  The agency closed the CARS program to further transactions on August 25, 2009, more than 2 months earlier than initially planned.

C.	ADVANCED PLANNING

Advance planning is not available due to the overwhelming number of voucher requests submitted by dealers.  With the infusion of additional funds, these requests are expected to grow significantly.  In addition, the pace with which the vouchers are being submitted far exceeds program estimates.  The agency will not be able to manage the CARS transaction workload and meet statutory requirements without additional resources.  These resources need to be committed to the program in a very short timeframe so that requests for reimbursement continue to be processed on a timely basis.     

D.	CONSIDERATION OF OTHER SOURCES

When the legislation was enacted, the agency conducted market research with industry leaders having expertise in the area of transaction processing.  The agency selected the firm that best represented itself as able to provide all necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities to perform the level of work necessary to meet the CARS program requirements at that time.  However, this approach was based on processing $1 billion worth of transactions within four months.  Based on the volume of submissions received within the first few days of the program, the agency's needs for the CARS program changed.  

Instead of a firm that could provide a broader range of services, the agency required a firm that could ramp up a large workforce capable of processing CARS transactions within days of award.  Most of these industry leaders considered during the earlier market research did not have the infrastructure in place to assign more than a few hundred employees immediately to the CARS program.  

The agency sought expertise in voucher transaction processing with ability to add a significant amount of people in a short period of time.  After reaching out to other Federal agencies for information and assistance on contractors able to provide this type of service, the agency identified two firms with significant experience in processing government transactions with sizable workforces able to begin work immediately.      




E.	COST INFORMATION

The estimated cost for this effort is not to exceed $10,648,493.  This cost is based on the resources required to conduct this effort.  

F.	UNIQUE CAPABILITIES/CIRCUMSTANCES 

The agency determined that ACS could assist the agency in meeting the statutory requirements of the CARS program, and provide the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities to perform the level of work required by the agency.  Specifically, ACS was able to commit 1500-2000 employees to process CARS transactions within days of award.  In addition, ACS has extensive experience with similar processing services for other Federal agencies.

Due to the urgency created by the statutory requirements, the volume of vouchers for reimbursement, and the immediate need for a firm that has significant experience and expertise in the areas mentioned above, a contract to perform this effort should be awarded to ACS. 

G.	SCHEDULE REQUIREMENT

The contract shall have an estimated period of performance of one (1) month from award with, if exercised, an additional one (1) week option period for a total performance period of five (5) weeks. 

H.	OTHER FACTORS

Because the agency received an unprecedented number of voucher requests, the agency's needs for the services and supplies represented an unusual and compelling urgency.  Specifically, the receipt of hundreds of thousands of voucher requests in conjunction with the statutory deadline for processing voucher requests precludes full and open competition.  Failure to make an immediate award would delay significantly the processing of vouchers already received and those that the agency will continue to receive as a result of the additional funding.  As this Government program was designed to stimulate the economy and, in particular, the automotive industry, and to provide a benefit environmentally by reducing gas guzzling vehicles from the nations roads, any delay in providing required reimbursements will harm the purposes of the program.  

I.	SUBSEQUENT REQUIREMENTS

Not applicable. 

J.	STATUTORY AUTHORITY

The sole source acquisition is justified under the authority contained the following citations:

(a) Authority.
(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2).
(2) When the agencys need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.
(b) Application. This authority applies in those situations where
(1) An unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition, and
(2) Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.
(c) Limitations.
(1) Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justifications and approvals described in 6.303 and 6.304. These justifications may be made and approved after contract award when preparation and approval prior to award would unreasonably delay the acquisition.
(2) This statutory authority requires that agencies shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances
