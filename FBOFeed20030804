Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  All responses received within 5 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with IBM Corporation, 6710 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20817 to extend the period of performance of its Class VIII Supercomputer system located at the Bowie Computer Center under Contract No. 50-SANW-9-00001.  The Government intends to extend a portion of the existing lease and related support services an additional twelve (12) months from October 1, 2003, through September 30, 2004.  This system is utilized by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction of the National Weather Service to assimilate the environmental data and to execute the numerical models which form the basis for all routine weather and climate forecasts, public and private, produced in the United States.  The Class VIII Supercomputer system consists of an IBM Power3 cluster comprised of 20 compute frames (64 Power3 processors per frame), each processor having 512 MB memory, redundant 18 GB disk drives for each node, two IBM SP switch frames, 32 TB of hard disk storage, support for the General Parallel File System, Load Leveler and other necessary IBM UNIX software. The system is connected to a StorageTek tape silo via Gigabit ethernet and employs Tivoli Storage Manager software. The Government maintains communication channels up to a Cisco router provided by IBM. The system is operated 7X24X365, support is provided continuously and system hardware maintenance is provided during normal working hours. Support staff are available to assist NCEP scientists with their applications, in particular MPI applications and structuring their jobs to make best use of Load Leveler attributes. The support staff also performs system administrations functions including upgrades, periodic maintenance and problem resolution. The system is used to run weather and climate forecasting models in support of research and development activities and is available for work (no more than a few nodes unavailable) at least 99% of the time. Data are re-packaged and transmitted to the new IBM Supercomputer storage system located in Gaithersburg, MD.  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and  documentation which demonstrates the ability to furnish, maintain, and provide the support services on a system comparable to what was previously described.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  In its determination, the Government will also consider the economic benefits and possible conversion costs associated with selecting a vendor other than the incumbent.  A determination not to open requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Affirmative responses must be received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis.  See Note 22.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for solicitation number NOI3086.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334516, which has a size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure on a sole source basis from Applied Biosystems a Synthesizer, DNA 3400 (qty-1); Kit, extended capacity upgrade 3400 (qty-1).  This system is intended to be procured from Applied Biosystems, the only known instrument  with compatibility with our current oligosynthesis platform consisting of four Applied Biosystems 394 DNA Synthesizers.  The Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology currently uses other DNA synthesizers that are networked, therefore, this is the only compatible instrument that can be added to our present system so that the entire operation will function correctly in union with one another and not simultaneously require the replacement of the entire contingent of four instruments at the same time.  The purchase of a different model of DNA synthesizer would also require the purchase of entirely different stocks of oligosynthesis chemicals, therefore, introducing a different set of unknown variables into oligonucleotide production.  The lab does not have to purchase separate stocks of DNA synthesis chemicals because the new instrument will allow the present stocks of phosphoramidites also to fit the new model.  This instrument is the only model that allows for the production of specialty oligonucleotides with five various modifications (fluorescent labeling with 6-FAM, HEX, and TET dyes, biotinylation, Phosphorylation with Phosphalink, and amine addition with TFA Amino link) as designated by several investigators within the Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology.  The mission of the Institute, Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology is to understand the production of oligonucleotides highest purity by this instrument is critical to several of LMMs ongoing projects.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Cui Jian, Director of Foreign Affairs Office, Southwest Regional Administration of Civil Aviation in China, Shuangliu International Airport, Chendgu, P. R. CHINA, Tel: (+86-28) 570-2302, Fax: (+86-28) 570-4085  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for evaluating and developing security, emergency and contingency plans at a sampling of airports in Southwest China.

Following the events of September 11th, security has become a priority issue for civil aviation administrations worldwide. In China, the national-level General Administration of Civil Aviation (CAAC) is looking to give greater emphasis to the integration of effective security planning as part of the nations aviation sector development. The development of airports in China is growing at a rapid rate. During the 10th Five Year Plan, over 100 airports are slated for construction or expansion. A number of these new airports are expected to be in Chinas southwest region. Civil airports within this region are under the administration of the Southwest Regional CAAC. 

The Southwest Region CAAC has oversight over 23 civil airports. By the year 2005, an additional 15 airports are expected to become operational in the region. By the year 2015, this should increase by another 8 bringing the total civil airports in the region to 46. The southwest region of China encompasses a population of nearly 200 million and includes significant industrial and tourism centers. Significant air traffic is generated in the region and is expected to grow as the area further develops economically. At present, no ICAO security audits have been conducted at any of the regions airports. In line with national directives, regional CAACs are charged with conducting re-assessment of security systems and practices within the airports of their jurisdiction, in order to help plan for the integration of improved systems to achieve higher levels of security and safety throughout the nations airports. In general regarding safety and security-related matters, the regional CAACs are involved in inspections, announcing security-related notices and orders, leading investigations of civil aviation-related safety and security problems, and the review and approval of civil air security management activities concerning airports in their region.

With its growing number of airports and levels of air traffic, Southwest CAAC considers security to be a high priority for the region. In order to assist it in the process of developing the most effective strategy for addressing the security needs of its airports, Southwest CAAC is utilizing USTDA grant assistance. The assistance will provide funding for the development of a strategy and action plan for future security infrastructure construction that will best address the security objectives of CAAC and meet international standards. The plan will be based on the assessment of existing systems and practices, identifying recommended technical, equipment, and management policy solutions, as well as financing options, implementation timelines, and procurement requirements.

The Consultant shall perform a detailed evaluation of Airport Security Program, Airport Emergency Plan and Airport Contingency Plan documents at a sampling of airports, to be identified by Southwest Regional officials in consultation with the contractor at the outset of project activities. The Consultant shall conduct on-site reviews of land-side and air-side security operations of the selected airports, providing detailed reports of their findings and recommendations for each. The reports shall address the status of present aviation security systems and provide detailed plans for rectifying deficiencies. These plans shall include specifications for new or upgraded Aviation Security equipment systems and/or components, cost estimates, financing alternatives and training needs. The Consultant shall identify relevant U.S. technologies for the recommended systems. 

It is expected that in the implementation of project tasks that the Consultant shall provide on the job training to two CAAC Aviation Security Specialists in the performance of all aspects of the aviation security evaluation process. This is to assist in developing the capacity of CAAC personnel to conduct similar assessments in other airports within the region and apply the lessons learned from this project. In this way, the Strategy developed by this study can be further verified and updated by CAAC to adapt to changing circumstances.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $272,660 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., September 15, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-15, items effective May 22, 2003. *** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 424690 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ******The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) job to manufacture 1 kg lots of Ceria and Zinc Oxide Powders. ***Nano-sized cerium (IV) oxide and zinc oxide powders shall be prepared in 1 kg quantities for use as the feedstock for NIST Standard Reference Material, SRM, 1979, the x-ray powder diffraction crystallite size standard.   The materials must be substantially free of the microstructural defects that result in strain broadened X-ray diffraction profiles to the point that such broadening is undetectable with conventional equipment. 
***The first SRM feedstock material, cerium (IV) oxide, shall to be produced on a 1 kg scale with a particle size in the 20 nm ranges, and with a very narrow distribution over the 5 nm to 35 nm ranges.  The second SRM feedstock material, zinc oxide, shall also be produced on a 1 kg scale.  However, zinc oxide crystallizes in a columnar habit; thus considering the larger dimension, the particle size for zinc oxide shall be in the 80 nm range with a very narrow distribution over the 60 nm to 100 nm particle size range.  Starting materials shall be at least 99.99% purity.  The method for the ceria shall be a precipitation reaction between cerium (IV) sulfate solution and an ammonium hydroxide solution conducted in a fixed-element flow reactor.  The method for the zinc oxide shall be a precipitation reaction between zinc acetate and an ammonium hydroxide solution also to be conducted in a fixed-element flow reactor.  Separation and washing of the product, to be done by centrifugation, shall be conducted using centrifuge equipment sized to process 130 L of slurry in no more than 36 hours to minimize the effects of precipitate aging.  A final wash using anhydrous ethanol shall be done to displace water and assure a friable product.  The wet powder (10 L to 15 L) will be apportioned into shallow, flat pans and heated in an oven that will accommodate the entire batch and maintain a very uniform temperature profile throughout, to insure that all portions of the product will experience a similar thermal history.  For safety reasons, the oven shall be purgable with nitrogen particularly during the volatilization of residual ethanol at temperatures between 80 C and 110 C.  Subsequently, the material shall be subjected to a heating rate of 100 C/h, up to a maximum temperature of 400 C for the ceria, and 375 C for the zinc oxide, at which point it will be maintained for 2 days.  The products shall be fine cerium (IV) oxide and zinc oxide powders that are substantially free of microstructural defects that result in strain broadened x-ray diffraction profiles. ***
***Work is to be performed in two stages. In the first stage, the vendor shall produce a minimum of 4 test powders in 5 -10 g quantities using the flow reactor technique.  Parameters concerning the chemistry and operation of the flow reactor shall be systematically varied for the production of these test powders in order to allow the determination of the optimal parameters for the 1 kg batch.  While it is expected that the vendor will interact with NIST in order determine experimental and production parameters of this procurement, NIST will determine how the material is to be produced and will accept responsibility for the results.  Operational parameters for each specimen will be determined by NIST after interactions with the Contractor.  Specimens will then be supplied sequentially to NIST for evaluation; such evaluation will take no longer than 2 weeks.  Following evaluation, changes in parameters for the following specimen shall be determined by NIST.  This process shall be followed for the total number of specimens as required.  The second stage shall produce the 1 kg quantity required for each SRM feedstock.  Operational parameters for the production of this large quantity shall be determined by NIST after evaluation of the data from the test specimens and discussions between the vendor and NIST. ***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and the total job shall be completed no later than one (1) year after receipt of order. ******The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ******The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quotation, conforming to this synopsis/solicitation, will offer the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>CONSULTATION WITH TRIBAL LEADERS.
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) through its Office of Native American Affairs is implementing a new Native American Initiative that will provide small business opportunities and economic development services to this country's most disadvantaged tribal areas.  Accordingly, the SBA intends to negotiate and award a contract for consultation services on a sole source basis with the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), 1301 Connecticut Ave. NW, Washington, DC.  The contractor shall perform all support and associated logistics to hold a one-day meeting/consultation with a minimum of 30 national Native American tribal leaders for the purpose of soliciting recommendations from them on how to improve economic development and increase the number of jobs in the most disadvantaged tribal areas.  The contractor will also compile the tribal leaders' recommendations into a report which will serve as a resource for implementation of the next phase of the Initiative, and will also be used during the development of the Native American Affairs strategic 5 and 10-year plans.  NCAI is the only national organization (non-profit) representing the target audience, and the only entity with the necessary combination of expertise in (a) organizing national meetings, (b) specific expertise and knowledge of tribal economic issues, and (c) the ability to contribute to and compile a final report detailing recommendations to improve economic development and increase jobs in the most disadvantaged tribal areas.  In addition, SBA believes that tribal leaders will be more likely to participate in this consultation with NCAI involvement.  Any expressions of interest in this requirement must be received no later than 8/14/03.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The presolicitation announcement to Construct Phase I of the Combined Arms Collective Training Facility (CACTF) at Fort Riley, Kansas is hereby modified to include Phase II as a NOT TO EXCEED (NTE) option. The second phase will include construction within the same site as Phase I work, and construction at two other range training areas. Construction includes additional training buildings at the Phase I site, and additional construction of an Urban Assault Course, Live Fire Shoot House, Breach Facility, and Zero Fire Pistol Range at the other training areas.  The NTE amount will be pre-priced in the bid schedule. Bidders shall submit a firm-fixed amount for the profit to be included in the NTE amount, which will be used in evaluating the total price for award purposes.  The Base schedule will also include a line item for Phase II Preconstruction Services by the Contractor. These will be services to assist in the final design of the Phase II work to insure that the established NTE ceiling is not exceeded. At the conclusion  of the Phase II final design, the incumbant Contractor shall submit a proposal to complete the Phase II work that does not exceed the established NTE amount. The profit for this option will be the firm-fixed profit amount submitted with the bid schedule. The Government will then negotiate a final price for the Phase II work with the incumbant Contractor, and upon achieving a bilateral agreement conforming to these conditions, the incumbant Contractor will be awarded a contract modification exercising the P hase II option.  The estimated magnitude of the Phase II work procurement is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000 (FAR 36.204 and DFARS 236.204). The total estimated magintude of the total procurement, if all options are exercised, is over $25,000,000 and less than $100,000 .

These services have been provided under a Government-Owned Contractor-Operated (GOCO) contract for over ten years.

<DESC>The purpose of this Synopsis Modification is to clarify the number of modifications that were issued under the Pre-solicitation Notice for proposed acquisition DE-RP01-03SO40005. The Pre-solicitation Notice for above referenced acquisition was posted on 04/09/03.  In addition, a Supplement (posted 04/11/03) and three (3) modifications (not 7) were also issued. On June 20, 2003, an error occurred while attempting to post the a modification, which resulted in the same modification appearing five (5) times rather than once at the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) and the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web locations.  Although the DOE IIPS data base has been revised to correct this error, the multiple references for the modification issued in June 2003 may still appear at the FedBizOpps web address. Based on the above, the number of modifications under the June 20, 2003 posting date is revised to reflect the issuance of only one (1) modification rather than five (5), resulting in an overall total posting of three (3) modifications between May 8, 2003 and July 30, 2003. The correct number of modifications cited above excludes the Supplement (posted 04/11/03) and this clarification modification.

<DESC>This notice is modified to read as follows:This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number RFQ-035-4384-03 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that is in effect through FAC 01-13.  This procurement is set aside for small business.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334119.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business size standard is 1000 employees. USDA ARS has a requirement for a high speed camera to aid in the study of dispersal and infection processes of the citrus canker pathogen in south Florida.  The equipment will be used in conjunction with the wind tunnel facility to compliment ongoing research projects on citrus canker. A high speed camera is required to freeze in motion airborne water droplets (ca. 1 mm - >5 mm diameter) in wind speeds up to 70-100 mph. It must be a system that is straightforward to operate, dismantle, reassemble and transport between sites.
The high speed camera will be used to study the infection and dispersal processes of the citrus canker pathogen. Citrus canker is a notifiable disease under strict eradication policy in south east (Dade and Broward counties) and southwest (Hendry and Collier counties) and west central Florida (Manatee and Hillsborough counties). Our understanding of the epidemiology of the disease is limited. A thorough knowledge of the factors that allow infection and dispersal of the pathogen will contribute to developing a fundamental understanding of the disease epidemiology and will pave the way to a better, more informed and rational approach to its management and eventual eradication. To ascertain effects of wind driven and rainsplash and spray on dispersal of and infection by the citrus canker pathogen visualisation of droplet size and speed is required. No other system apart from a high-speed camera can record the size and speed of droplets of water in strong wind. The range of windspeeds from still to those experienced in tropical storm conditions (40-70 mph) need to be tested. Thus the camera must be capable of freezing in motion a droplet traveling at at least 70 mph in a wind tunnel facility. Wind speeds in the presence of different types of rain will be applied to plants and tested for their effect on both infection and dispersal of the pathogen. Visualizing the droplets will allow us to relate droplet characteristics (speed and size) in different wind types to subsequent infection. The combinations of rain and wind that causes maximum infection and dispersal will be ascertained, as will those conditions that cause negligible infection or dispersal. The role of water soaking of leaves and the wind speeds associated with this phenomenon will be investigated as a factor facilitating infection.
The digital camera must be sold as a complete working system with peripherals and must have the following specifications/capabilities: It must have a camera lens suitable of recording images through the side of (or port in) a plexiglass wind tunnel at distances of ca. 20-80 cm. The wind tunnel is 100 cm x 100 cm cross section. The camera must come inclusive of a light source kit that can be used as back or front-source lighting (including a stand, suitable bulbs, a reflector etc). It must come equipped with tripods, friction arm and super clamp to allow positioning of the camera head to a hight of ca. 1.5 m. It will come equipped with a suitable trigger kit. It must have a hard case for transport/storage. The camera head should be a compact digital camera head (not more than 25x10x10 cm, LxWxH ). The shutter must be able to freeze splash and spray drops in windspeeds of up to 70-100 mph and have an ability to take sufficient frames per second to allow tracking of individual splash droplets (as small as 1->5 mm diameter) down wind (so appropriate frames per second, shutter speed and resolution must provide this capability). The resolution of the image must be sufficient to allow estimation of droplet speed and size (pixcels numbers at higher shutter speeds must be consistent with image resolution). The camera must be capable of recording and storing sufficient numbers of frames (recording time) to allow for estimation of droplet size at 70-100 mph. It must be possible to control the camera from a PC and have an independent control pad for remote use. The images should be downloadable to a PC or notebook in regular JPEG formats. The camera will come with software that will be capable of both camera control and image replay and downloading. Full playback control is required, image sequence loop, zoom, contrast and brightness adjustment, and image pan. The software should have the capability for estimating individual droplet size and speed. It must also be possible to use the software to save a selected section of a recorded image sequence. The images should be able to be saved as JPEG (additional optional formats are OK). The camera should have a playback mode in both forward and reverse and be able to do this at speeds up to ca. 30 fps. Descriptive literature showing that the offered equipment meets all specifications must accompany the quotation.  Delivery time is 60 days ARO.  Equipment price should be FOB Ft. Pierce, FL. Quoted price must include delivery costs.  The government anticipates award of a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the specifications will be most advantageous to the Government.  PAYMENT: Any award made under this solicitation is subject to 31 CFR Part 208 which requires all payments made by the government to be made by electronic funds transfer.

Classification Code:	A -- Research & Development
Contracting Office Address
Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Directed Energy (DE) Directorate, 2251 Maxwell Ave, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117 
A ? REQUIREMENT
THIS IS A RE-SOLICITATION OF A PREVIOUS HBCU/MI SET-ASIDE ANNOUNCEMENT.  In an effort to obtain more depth and breadth within the topic areas white papers are now being solicited from non-HBCU/MI universities and from industry on a non-fee-bearing basis as well as any HBCU/MI who may have missed the first announcement.  All white papers will be evaluated according to the evaluation criteria of this announcement and all other terms remain unchanged.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) requests proposals for University-based Laser Technologies for Information and Materials Advancement (ULTIMA). The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Phillips Research Site (PRS), Directed Energy Directorate (DEBS), Kirtland AFB, NM solicits proposals to develop research in advanced laser, electro-optical technologies, observatory instrumentation and applications, and potential dual-use scientific research that enhances AFRL, Air Force, DoD or National Scientific programs and requirements. The ULTIMA program is especially interested in pushing the state of the art in the following technical areas:

1.  Laser Research.  Research, analysis, development, and demonstration of technologies associated with laser sensing for applications such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), imaging, remote sensing, detection, and laser communications.  Development of hardware and software such as eye-safe lasers for commercial and military applications, high-speed or high?resolution/fidelity sensors, wavefront control, pointing and tracking, ultra-lightweight mirrors or collectors, imaging algorithms, and discrimination algorithms.  Concept and system operation developments for activities such as UAV or satellite-based laser sensing, active and passive satellite sensing and imaging (including geo-synchronous satellite imaging), and space-based relay mirror concepts, applications and technologies.

2.  Observatory Potential Dual-Use Exploitation.  Development of new areas of research, experimentation and instrumentation to augment national caliber observatories and facilities such as Magdelena Ridge Observatory, White Sands Missile Range, Apache Point/Sunspot, and Geo Light Imaging National Testbed (GLINT). Besides these particular facilities, this area includes proposals of field measurements at these or other proposed facilities as appropriate. This technology area also includes any ideas in instrumentation for general telescope facilities, whether it be for technology demonstration, observatory control, science measurements, or data analysis. 

3.  New Materials, Mining, and Manufacturing Technologies.  The introduction and investigation of new uses or alternate technologies for 1) laser materials and devices, especially eye-safe lasers with potential dual military and commercial applications; 2) materials science, mining metrology and exploration techniques; 3) MEMS, liquid crystal, electronic or solid state materials; and, 4) flexible, membranous, or otherwise new optical materials.


AFRL will not issue a separate solicitation. AFRL is distributing this BAA electronically through FedBizOps at http://www.eps.gov. Once there, offerors should enter "BAA 02-DE-01" into the search option to reach the posting. White papers are due 22 Mar 02. All white papers should be received by 1:30 p.m. Mountain Time on the due date. Late white paper submissions will be evaluated based upon the availability of funds. This is a restricted solicitation under NAICS code 54171. This BAA has been set-aside for historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCU/MI). Foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer or Project Manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.  AFRL may make more than one award against this announcement.  Further, AFRL reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed, either a contract subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), an assistance instrument (grant, cooperative agreement or other transaction for research) or an other transaction for prototype.  If a non-FAR instrument is proposed, the offeror shall complete and submit the certifications available with this announcement with its proposal.  


B-ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS: 1. Some testing may be performed at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, New Mexico and offerors should contact the technical POC to discuss assets and their availability. 2. AFRL intends to award incrementally funded instruments. AFRL reserves the right to make no award, a single award, or the possibility of making more than one award within a given topic area. 3. The total duration of the awards(s) is expected to be 36 months beginning in the second (2nd) quarter calendar year (CY) of 2002. 4. The budget for this BAA is $4.85 million.  PLEASE REALIZE THIS FUNDING PROFILE IS AN ESTIMATE ONLY, IS NOT A PROMISE FOR FUNDING, AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO GOVERNMENT DISCRETION AND AVAILABILITY.  5. Offerors may obtain a copy of the AFRL Guide entitled "BAA/PRDA GUIDE", dated 29 Jun 98, from the Internet. This guide will help offerors understand the BAA process. To see the guide, go to http://extra.afrl.af.mil/policy-guides.htm. From there, click on "BAA Guide".

C-WHITE PAPER PROCESS: 1. An offeror may propose on any or all objective areas or any portion of any objective area.  However, offerors are limited to two-page white papers per topic area describing the work to be undertaken with a rough order or magnitude of cost. Attach the resume of the Principal Investigator or of key personnel to the white paper.  Resumes or University prospectuses or other generic publications will not count against the two-page limit.  White papers will be evaluated according to the criterion in section F below, during peer review. All offerors will be notified in writing of the results. AFRL will attempt to make notification within 30 days from receipt of white papers.  2.  Only those offerors whose white papers meet the criterion will be requested to submit full proposals, however, any offeror who submitted a white paper may elect to submit a full proposal. Proposals will then be evaluated according to the criteria in section G below. After AFRL evaluates the proposals and performs an affordability review of the cost/budget proposal(s), it will decide which proposals will be given an award and which will not. 3. Any unsuccessful offeror may request a debriefing. 4. A copy of an awardee's final report under any resultant instrument(s) will be available, subject to national disclosure policy and regulations.  5. Offerors shall submit their white paper and/or proposal to Marialyn Achille-Argaez at the following address (if mailed): Det 8 AFRL/PKDB (Directorate of Contracting), 2251 Maxwell Ave SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5773; or (if hand-carried) Building 499, Room 127, Kirtland AFB NM.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division plans to negotiate with Lockheed Martin Naval Electronics & Surveillance Systems (LMNE&SS) on a sole source basis under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".   The contractor will be responsible services and hardware necessary for the production of MH-60S Tactical Operational Flight Trainer (TOFT) #3, to be located at Naval Station (NS) Norfolk Chambers Field, Norfolk, VA in January 2006.  Key issues associated with this need are: The TOFT #1 LMNE&SS aerodynamic model is being extensively redesigned, for TOFT #2, to match the MH-60S flight dynamics.  This redesign is an imperative requirement for TOFT #3.  The TOFT #2 will be designed with a PC-based commercial visual system instead of the existing TOFT #1 Common Visual System (CVS).  The new PC-based visual system is necessary to resolve CVS end-of-life supportability issues, which will make logistical support extremely difficult in the near future.  Extensive design changes to the existing visual image generator and host computer will result from the PC-based visual system upgrade.  These design changes must be incorporated into TOFT #3.  LMNE&SS will develop TOFT #2 with a PC-based host computer system as opposed to the obsolescent computer version used in TOFT #1.   The PC-based host computer technology insertion is also due to end-of-life supportability issues, which render continued logistical support of this system extremely difficult.  Extensive host computer architecture design changes will be necessary due to the new design PC-based host computer system.  These design changes will also have to be incorporated into TOFT #3.  The TOFT #2 final design software, documents, and associated Level II drawings for the aerodynamic model, PC-based visual and host systems, required for TOFT #3, will not be available to the Government for use or distribution until June 2005.   The total period of performance for this upgrade is 21 months with an estimated delivery date of January 2006.  The estimated cost for this effort is $11.0M.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, pricing, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address (Attn: Michael White) by August 22, 2003.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than FIVE pages.  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice. ****

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase 10 each Excess Noise Ratio (ENR) Measurement Instrument, (WSR-88D), Micronetics P/N NT-187-1, NSN: 6625-01-465-6031, ASN: R400-SE44. The only source of supply known for this item is Micronetics Wireless, Hudson, NH 03051. These items are being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS) to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. This item is used to maintain the WSR-88D weather surveillance radars commonly known as NEXRAD.  Micronetics Wireless has developed a calibrated noise generator, the NT-187-1, for use in calibrating their proprietary Noise Source, RFN-363, which is used in the WSR-88D.  This specific model of the ENR Measurement Instrument, NT-187-1 was developed in conjunction with the National Weather Service Operational Support Facility Engineering Branch for specific use with the WSR-88D radar system.  It is required for in the WSR-88D radar to determine if Noise Sources (RFN-363) are acceptable for stock, and are in calibration at the 166 operational WSR-88D radar sites. The WSR-88D radar system uses the RFN-363 within tighter tolerances than the specification for the device itself.  In other words, the RFN-363 can meet technical specifications for procurement, but not meet operational requirements in the WSR-88D. The NT-187-1 will allow for a procedure to periodically check and calibrate the RFN-363 for use within NEXRAD operational specifications at operational WSR-88D field sites. As these parts are in support of current NWS NEXRAD program, alternative or like items could not be acceptable without extensive testing. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions. Any business able to provide the exact make and model of the equipment reference herein is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 10 calendar days after its publication. Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified equipment. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other government agencies to which it has previously provided these items. The information should be submitted to the address stated herein or email a request to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or may be faxed to telephone number 816-426-7530 ATTN: Karen Christian. Failure to provide the required information will deem your request non-responsive. This is NOT a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The government reserves the right to solicit bids based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue a purchase order to Micronetics Wireless, whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the government. The anticipated award date shall be on or about 15 calendar days after date of this announcement. The NAICS code for this action is 334515.  All responsible sources may submit a bid which will be considered by the Agency.

<CONTACT>Charles Nash, Dr., Phone *803) 725-2615, Fax (803) 725-8829, Email charles.nash@srs.gov
<DESC>Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site for the Department of Energy (DOE) near Aiken, South Carolina, is seeking potential vendors to pelletize an inorganic material (monosodium titanate [MST]) for adsorption applications.  This specialized task requires vendor knowledge of methods of pelletizing and of handling inorganic solids.  R&D for this work is to be minimal as WSRC is seeking application of existing technology to produce pelletized samples for testing and evaluation.  Monosodium titanate is a relatively nontoxic inorganic powder available through government owned and publicly available technology.  In pellet form its adsorptive capabilities could be exploited in sorption columns for the treatment of millions of gallons of nuclear byproduct supernate at DOE complex sites.
MST is produced by the sol-gel hydrolysis of organic titanium chemicals to produce an inorganic sorbent.  The powder is inert to highly caustic aqueous feeds.  Sorptive properties of the powder are valuable for nuclear waste treatment because of its selectivity for strontium and actinides in neutral to caustic aqueous solutions.  There is some evidence that MST might be sensitive to extreme heat and to complete drying; we are thus interested in low-temperature processes that do not attempt to sinter the material.  Very importantly, we are interested in processes that do not leave any significant organic materials in the final pellet product.  Binding agents shall be highly resistant to dissolution or degradation in caustic solutions.  To summarize, the desired pellet product (1) shall contain only trace organic compounds that pose no downstream processing concerns; (2) shall contain MST still retaining good adsorption characteristics; (3) the preferred particle size distribution for the engineered particles is between 250 and 600 micron (30 x 60 mesh) with a mean size near 380 microns; (4) shall be sufficiently porous so that adsorption is still practical; (5) shall tolerate up to 7 molar sodium salts with up to 3 molar free hydroxide; and (6) shall generate few fines, allowing practical sorption column operation.  MST is a single-use material, thus elution and strong acid stability is not an issue.

Interested companies are expected to provide at least 100g samples of pelletized MST for testing at WSRC.  WSRC will provide the MST.  Testing will provide comparisons of various materials and results will be available to participants.  Favorable results may lead to procurement of pelletized MST for plant use; however, this call is not a procurement and implies no commitment on the part of WSRC or DOE.  

Any company interested in pursuing this need must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than August 26, 2003, summarizing the companys business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on existing MST technology.  Company qualifications should include, but not be limited to, compatible product lines, sufficient manufacturing capacity, reasonable schedule for sample provision.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice:  Dr. Charles A. Nash, telephone (803) 725-2615; fax (803) 725-8829; email charles.nash@srs.gov; or address Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-42A, Room #182, Aiken, SC 29808. This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in future opportunities only.

Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, (Water Conservation Area 1), Boynton, FL.  Other category 1- listed invasive exotic trees should be treated if they are found in co-habitation with melaleuca or Old World climbing fern unless it is stipulated by the specific work order for a treatment area that these plants shall not be treated.  The majority of the work shall be in Water Conservation Area 1.  The REFUGE shall provide any local knowledge or other restrictions that may be applicable to the specific project location prior to the commencement of work.  Applications must be performed in such a manner as to protect non-target organisms, the environment, and the public.

The ground supervisor must be a licensed herbicide applicator and shall be responsible for data collection, herbicide application and inventory, herbicide safety procedures, and crew supervision.  The ground crew supervisor must also have navigation equipment such as a hand-held Global Positioning System (G.P.S.) unit, to mark areas of treatment for future references.  Ideally, all trees must be treated and treatment sites recorded at each designated location before proceeding further. The Refuge COR and Project Biologist, Bill Thomas, Jr. (561)732-3684, shall provide technical support concerning species treatments for each delineated work area.  Under no circumstances shall a non-approved herbicide, or combination there of, be used without knowledge, or permission of Refuge manager, or project biologist.  A site visit is not planned for this year's treatment location due to the vastness of the area.  In past years, Contractors have had great success renting a helicopter to recon delineated treatment areas to assist with the bidding process; however, this remains optional at the discretion of the CONTRACTOR.  Technical questions can be directed to Refuge Wildlife Biologist Bill Thomas, Jr. at (561) 732-3684 X108.
