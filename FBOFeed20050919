<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  Information Exploitation Technology, SOL BAA 05-45, Abstracts and Proposals Due: Anytime between 19 September 2005 and 19 September 2006; Technical POC: Dr. Robert Tenney, Deputy Director, DARPA/IXO; Phone (703) 696-2298.  BACKGROUND:  DARPA's Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of enabling technology, critical subsystems, and full system concepts that will provide revolutionary improvement to the efficiency and effectiveness of military Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, strike and stability operations in complex battlespaces.  The goal of this procurement is to identify and develop novel ideas for sensing, signal processing, target characterization, data fusion, target tracking, predictive awareness, battle management, collaborative planning, and visualization that can contribute to future conflict mitigation, warfighting and peacekeeping effectiveness.  Ideas can address 1) ways to employ new scientific/technical developments to achieve significant increases in component performance; 2) novel combinations of existing technologies into systems that create new warfighting capabilities; or 3) combinations of both.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION:  As a DARPA systems-oriented office, IXO is interested in both system applications and enabling technologies.  IXO’s application areas span the full range of anticipated DoD missions, from 1) influencing of potential adversary actions to avoid conflict to 2) shaping the battlespace before conflict to 3) improving the effectiveness of major combat operations to 4) providing force multipliers for post-conflict reconstruction and stability operations.  In each of these mission areas, IXO focuses on automating and accelerating the processes necessary to lift the fog of war, understand the adversary, and increase the pace of battle.  Meeting these objectives requires a diverse set of technologies, that when placed in a system context, can provide significant advances in DoD capability.  IXO is interested in proposals that combine emerging technologies with high-payoff system applications.  Proposals that address any combination of technology and application that fall within IXO’s broad mission objectives may be submitted under this BAA.  TECHNOLOGIES OF INTEREST:  Technologies that interest IXO include but are not limited to: 1) Sensors, 2) Sensor Processing, 3) Environmental Discovery, 4) Target Discrimination, 5) Tracking, 6) Information Fusion, 7) Signature Discovery, 8) Context Analysis, 9) Network Analysis, 10) Game Theory, 11) Modeling, 12) Computational Social Science, 13) Emergent Behavior Exploitation, 14) Ad Hoc Networking, 15) Control Methods, (16) Planning, 17) Autonomy, 18) Platforms, 19) Robotics, 20) Observables Management, 21) Very Large Databases, 22) Processors, 23) Displays, 24) Mission-specific Communication Links, and 25) Human-computer Interaction.
SYSTEM APPLICATIONS OF INTEREST:  High payoff system applications that interest IXO include but are not limited to: 1) Rapidly Defeating Elusive Surface Targets, 2) Understanding of the Urban Battlespace, 3) Understanding the 21st Century Battlespace, 4) Managing the Scale and Complexity of the Network-centric Battlespace, 5) Combat ID of Individuals, 6) Getting Situation Data Into the Head of the Busy Warfighter, 7) Obtaining Reliable Forensics in Cluttered Environments, and 8) Knowing What is Over the Hill / Around the Corner / Behind the Wall.  Further details on specific technology and application interest, program phases, selection criteria, and submission instructions may be found in the Proposer’s Information Package (PIP) which can be accessed at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/IXT/index.htm.  TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES:  DARPA intends to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding BAA 05-45.  Technical, contractual, or administrative questions must be sent to BAA05-45 @darpa.mil. Answers to all questions generally relevant to the technical, contractual, and administrative aspects of the solicitation will be posted at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/IXT/index.htm under Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for public access.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit abstracts in advance of full proposals.  DARPA will employ an electronic upload process for abstract/proposal submissions for BAA 05-45.  Performers may find guidance for abstract/proposal submission at: http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/IXT/index.htm.  This BAA will remain open from 19 September 2005 through 19 September 2006.  Throughout this period, DARPA will receive and review abstracts and/or proposals on a continuous basis and proposers are encouraged to submit innovative abstracts and/or proposals at any time during this period.  Please reference http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/IXT/index.htm for complete submission instructions.  OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement and to award without discussions.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and team with others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCUs and MIs participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of technology for exclusive competition among these entities.  Government contractors are required to register at the Government’s Central Contractor Registration site in order to negotiate contracts with most government agencies.  This URL is provided as a reference: http://www.ccr.gov.  Since this FedBizOpps Announcement, along with the PIP, constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement as contemplated in the FAR 6.102 (d)(2)(i), all prospective Proposers MUST also refer to the PIP before submitting a proposal.  Proposals MUST NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  Original Point of Contact: Michael Blackstone, Contracting Officer, Email BAA05-45@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Innovative Consulting, Inc., 1717 Beck Avenue, Panama City, FL 32405 on a sole-source basis for services to support the Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Systems (LFEMS) programs. Specialized knowledge in the areas of electromagnetic field theory, signal analysis, and stochastic processes is required for completion of this task. Innovative Consulting is uniquely qualified to provide the services required in this order as they provided primary support for the initial development of the Near-Field Electromagnetic Propagation In Conductive Media –EXCEL Workbook Users Guide and other magneto-inductive communications program areas.  Any other contractor would be required to duplicate a significant amount of this previous work in order to establish the knowledge base that Innovative Consulting has, which it is estimated would increase the cost by 100%.  Deliverables include technical, analytical, design a!  nd test reports.  Supplier must have local presence for on-site support as needed.  The period of performance will be for six (6) months from award.  Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated.  NAICS Code 541330 applies.  Size standard is $23M.  FSC is AD94.

Additionally, BAE will be integrating 3rd party toxic industrial sensors (TICs) in to the baseline UGS.  Integration of the JCAD and TIC sensors require previous experience with the BAE proprietary Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA) sensor.  Specifically, the development and implementation of MNUGS with TICS capability requires the integration of TICS sensors with the BAE proprietary CWA sensor.  The integration of MNUGS with TICS capability into the Critical Area Protection System requires modifications to BAE Proprietary message c!  ode previously developed.  Accordingly, only BAE can perform the integration.  Shipping will be to: Naval Support Activity, Panama City, Florida. Note 22 applies.

<CONTACT>Elaine Flick Contracting Officer 3032363528     Elaine_Flick@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Business Center (NBC) has a requirement for a follow-on contract with Mr. Roy A. Morris, Expert Financial Consultant, to provide expert review and advice regarding the financial management program for the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act (SNPLMA), Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (BACA), Lincoln County Lands Act (LCLA), Clark County Conservation of Public Land and Natural Resources Act of 2002, and other legislative acts relative to land sales and acquisitions.  The estimated value of this requirement is $125,000.  The original contract, FAP050301, was awarded to Roy Morris in October 2004.  Specific areas for consultation and advice were and will continue to be concentrated in, but not be limited to: (1) Coordination with the following critical stakeholders in the above programs:  SNPLMA Business Manager; Field Manager and Associate Field Manager of the BLM Las Vegas Field Office; Assistant Field Manager of the Land Sales and Acquisitions Division, Las Vegas Field Office; State Director and Associate Director of the Nevada State Office; Director and Financial Staff of the National Business Center; Federal, state, and local governments on financial partnerships; legal counsel; (2) Interface with the Inspector General's Office (IG), General Account Office (GAO), privately contracted auditors, Department of Interior (DOI), other related entities as requested; (3) Review and Accountability for:  Interpretation of DOI, Treasury, and OMB regulations; review and make recommendations regarding regulations and management of the special accounts for the Acts; the SNPLMA Inter-/Intra-Agency agreements and Assistance Agreements; (4) Review financial reports, SNPLMA Grand Matrix, SNPLMA Implementation Agreement, SNPLMA business rules and practices, other SNPLMA agreements; and (5) Budgetary Consultation including: review and reconcile cash management fund, advise the National Business Center on timing of investments, funds control and accountability; quarterly internal financial reviews.  This acquisition presents a unique situation regarding the extensive knowledge, skills, and experience required to provide expert financial consultation in all the necessary areas.  Mr. Morris has extensive financial education and training, and has directly related experience and knowledge derived from Federal service in Washington, D.C. headquarters offices and as a former Director of the BLM National Business Center.  In addition he was a critical member of the team that set up the financial system for managing the SNPLMA Special Account and developed the business and accountability rules contained in the SNPLMA Implementation Agreement.  He has a unique understanding not only of the federal finance and budget rules, regulations, policies and procedures, but a thorough understanding of the requirements of the programs established by the Acts listed above, which is instrumental to the successful implementation of those programs.  Mr. Morris has personal and business contacts within Federal government agencies as well as local and state governments which will enable him to quickly and efficiently obtain needed information and resolve issues relative to the required consultation tasks he'll perform under this contract.  Mr. Morris has an excellent working relationship and knowledge of the auditing requirements and procedures of the IG, GAO, etc.  The nature of the programs requires the consistency of a single point of contact for the required consulting services.  There is no single private source for such financial consultation which could provide the breadth and depth of knowledge and experience that Mr. Morris can bring to bear in accomplishing the required tasks and assuring the financial integrity and accountability for the programs and special accounts established by these Acts.   For the above-stated reasons, the circumstances permitting other than full and open competition as cited in 41 U.S.C.253(c)(2), and FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" are germane to this procurement.  This statutory authority applies as a follow-on contract awarded to anyone other than Mr. Morris would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  As such, the BLM intends to award a firm-fixed price, labor hour contract, sole source, to Mr. Roy A. Morris for the follow-on effort described above.  Questions regarding this procurement may be directed to Elaine E. Flick, the Contracting Officer, at 303-236-3528.  See Note 22!

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for historical paper data capture and conversion services under the Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) initiative.  We will solicit the proposed acquisition under Full and Open Competition procedures.  We will consider all responsible sources that submit a proposal and price quotation.

The resulting performance-based contract will enable us to accurately capture (image) and convert the paper records of more than one million active or former (not retired) Federal employees.  By procuring capture and conversion services from an existing, proven capture and conversion provider, we will be able to convert, with minimal implementation time and risk, a large volume of historical data that can be used by new systems to deliver relevant, accurate, and prompt services to retirement program participants.

We encourage interested parties to submit offers either as a single entity or as a teaming effort.  The chosen offeror will provide services to capture and convert historical paper records into an electronic format to support our administration of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement Systems (FERS).  We will determine the total set of capabilities to be provided based upon your submissions and we will weigh the costs, benefits, and risks of your submissions.

Your submissions must include the following services, which we may purchase at our discretion:  (1) Document retrieval and tracking, (2) Document transport and preparation, (3) Document imaging and indexing, (4) Document reassembly, (5) Document disposal, (6) Data conversion, (7) Image and data storage, (8) Image and data retrieval, and (9) Image and data transfer.

We wish to purchase the services described in this solicitation under terms and conditions similar to those that typically apply to similar purchases in the private sector.  However, we have unique Federal Government constraints and we must ensure that the services we purchase meet the Federal retirement systems’ unique characteristics as we will describe in the RFP.

Place of Contract Performance:  The paper records are located at our secure storage facility in Boyers, Pennsylvania.  You will be responsible for retrieving records to be captured and converted from this facility.  We will determine the place of performance, for capture and conversion services, based on your submission.  However, the place of performance must not exceed the boundaries of the continental United States. Offshore personnel and facilities are prohibited for this procurement.

Duration of the Contract Period:  The period of performance includes a base period plus two (2) or three (3) one-year option years.  The base period will equal implementation, must not exceed 6 months, and we would prefer that implementation is completed in less than six months.  We prefer to complete the entire capture and conversion effort within the shortest period possible and that it take no more than two years.  If you believe it is advisable and have compelling reasons for using a third option year, you must describe your rationale within your RFP response.  The fourth option year is available as a contingency only, which will be negotiated by us and you, if needed.  You should not assume that a fourth year will be necessary. 

Preproposal Conference and Site Visit:  On October 20, 2005 you will have an opportunity to tour the storage facility at our Boyers, Pennsylvania location during the preproposal conference and site visit.  You are strongly encouraged to attend this preproposal conference and site visit.  This is the only opportunity available for you to tour our unique facilities.  Attending the preproposal conference and site visit will help you learn more about our storage facility and will help you prepare a stronger response to this procurement.  If you plan to attend the preproposal conference and site visit, you must email David Shively, by October 14, 2005, and include the following registration information:  (1) Your Company Name, (2) Single Company Point of Contact (first name, last name, title, telephone, fax, email, and mailing address), (3) Your Company Website, (4) List of Attendees (total number of your staff expected to attend the conference, first and last names, titles, social security numbers, U.S. citizenship status (yes or no), telephone, fax, email, and mailing addresses), (5) Your Business Classification Code, and (6) One-page executive summary of your Company (including a general overview of the services and products you offer) in MS Word format.  You will be limited to two participants at the preproposal conference and site visit.

After we receive your registration information, we will email your Company Point of Contact a preproposal conference and site visit Information/Registration Packet.  The packet will include information related to directions to our facility, hotel/lodging, transportation, special accommodations, and an example agenda for the site visit.  Note:  We will be reserving a block of hotel rooms for all site visit attendees.  The packet will provide you with instructions for notifying us of the hotel at which you are staying.

We anticipate issuing the solicitation on or about October 3, 2005.  Proposals will be due on or about November 16, 2005.  We will award to the responsible offeror whose proposal we determine provides the best value to the Government.  Our anticipated contract award date is April 1, 2006.

<DESC>The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), an independent Federal agency, is seeking sources to provide currently available Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) integrated loan origination and processing solutions that have the technical and functional capabilities, described below, and that have the flexibility to expand as the agency’s information needs and product lines grow.

OPIC tracks loans and investment funds in several systems, including a legacy system (converted from the WANG into APPX), and several MS Access databases and MS Excel spreadsheets.  The existing finance information architecture supporting our financials is not integrated, making it difficult to extract decision support and portfolio tracking information.  A fully integrated loan origination, loan processing, and general subledger COTS product will replace the existing finance information architecture and will allow the agency to view and track its financial portfolio without manual intervention.  OPIC also desires to make use of today's technology and business workflow capabilities for both its internal and external systems users.
	
The preferred COTS solution will capture and track information from the following phases of the loan lifecycle:

§	Origination (starting with receipt of a loan application, through the approval process to loan commitment/agreement phase) 
§	Processing (amortization schedules, invoicing, portfolio management) 
§	Accounting (disbursements, payables, cash receipts, journal vouchers) 
§	Monitoring (covenants, tracking loan performance)

<DESC>Description
CMS intends to award a 23-month fixed cost contract, with no options, to a small business to assist CMS in performing data processing and medical reviews for the Medicaid Error Rate (MER) project.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Potential offerors are hereby advised that their accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and that FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations of Subcontracting will be incorporated into the solicitation and resultant contract.  
BACKGROUND: CMS must estimate improper payments in the Medicaid program as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).  The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress.  
The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.
To implement error rate measurement in Medicaid, CMS will use a national contracting strategy.  Under this strategy, CMS will engage three contractors: (1) a statistical contractor (posted to Fedbizopps.gov August 4, 2005); (2) a documentation/database contractor (posted to Fedbizopps.gov August 10, 2005); and (3) a review contractor.  The statistical contractor will perform all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions.  The documentation/database contractor will gather medical policies and other necessary information from states; will maintain a database of the medical policies (along with quarterly updates to these policies) and will gather medical records from providers.  All information collected by the documentation/database contractor will be maintained in electronic format.  The review contractor will use the policies and medical records obtained by the documentation/database contractor to perform the medical reviews, provide findings to the statistical contractor, jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor and submit the report to CMS.
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS: The successful offeror, as the review contractor, shall make a payment determination for each sampling unit by performing data processing reviews and medical reviews.  The review contractor shall review each sampling unit to determine if was processed through the claims payment system correctly, medically necessary, coded correctly and properly paid or denied.  The review contractor shall validate whether each sampling unit was paid correctly based on: information found on the sampling unit, the information in the medical record, the information in the claims processing system, and state policies.  The review contractor shall conduct the data processing reviews on-site for each state selected, visiting each state between two and five times.  The medical reviews may be performed at a central location.
The sampling unit is defined as an individually priced service (e.g., a physician office visit, a hospital stay, a month of enrollment in Medicare).  The sampling unit may be a claim or line item. It is estimated that between 800 – 1200 sampling units or an average of 1000, per state, will need to be reviewed to achieve 3% precision at the 95% confidence level. The contractor shall perform this work for one complete production, December 31, 2005, through November 30, 2007.  This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal late August 2005 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a U. S. Department of Energy Laboratory, anticipates issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) to accredited colleges, universities, and other post-secondary educational institutions in early October, 2005. The RFP is for participation in the 2007 Solar Decathlon and for related development of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). The Solar Decathlon is an international collegiate competition. Student teams compete to design, build, and operate highly energy-efficient, completely solar-powered houses that incorporate BIPV. The next Solar Decathlon is anticipated to take place in Washington, D.C., in 2007. (Previous events were held in fall 2002 and 2005).

A critical outcome of the Solar Decathlon project is the development and demonstration of solar-powered homes in which, by the year 2015, the whole-house, levelized energy cost has been reduced to $.10/kWh, while complying with the criteria associated with the 10 contests that comprise the competition. NREL plans to solicit proposals from post-secondary educational institutions for entries that not only consider participation in the competition but also include a research and development (R&D) component that meets this critical outcome.

The 2005 Solar Decathlon Rules and Regulations document is available at http://www.solardecathlon.org. The 2005 document is the basis for the 2007 competition, though it will be revised prior to the 2007 event. The anticipated RFP will be available at the same Web site in early October.

Current plans are to award up to twenty (20) firm fixed price awards of $50,000 per year for two years under this solicitation. Organizations desiring a copy of the solicitation setting forth the RFP requirements should make a written request to jeffrey_soltesz@nrel.gov

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions that have been raised in response to the solicitation.  A full copy of this amendment, including the SF30 cover sheet can be found at the IRS Procurment website: http://www.irs.gov/opportunities/procurement.  A signed copy of the SF30 acknowledging the amendment is required to be submitted along with proposals.  The proposal due date is NOT extended as a result of this amendment.  All terms and conditions remain unchanged.  (Note: Numbering is continued from Amendment 0002).

Question # 27: How are the changes to the tax laws summarized each year?  Are they explicitly stated against the old tax laws (e.g., old tax law and new tax law side-by-side so as to easily identify where changes were made)?
   
Answer # 27: The Service does not maintain an all-inclusive list of changes in the tax law and the nature of those changes.  However, major/significant tax law changes are generally highlighted in applicable publications/instructions with an explanation of the nature of changes.  More centralized and complete information may be available through private vendors such as CCH. 

Question # 28: What materials (e.g., books, notes, calculators) are applicants allowed to bring into the testing sites?  

Answer # 28: Unless related to a reasonable accommodation request, no books, notes, or calculators are permitted. 
 
Question # 29: What percentage of items (on average) each year do you believe were outdated the following year due to changes in tax laws?  Are the majority of the items typically based upon tax laws that are revised the following year, or do the changes in the tax laws not really impact the items that have been included in previous administrations of the test?  

Answer # 29:  Typically, a very small percentage of items have been outdated from one year to the next.  However, this is completely dependent upon the extent of rewrite of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and could vary at any time.  
 
Question # 30: One requirement is to develop test preparation materials and make them available to applicants. Please be kind enough to specify the type and nature of test preparation materials that are envisioned.  

Answer # 30: This evaluation factor relates to the Statement Of Objectives paragraph 6.0.e "Public notice and other outreach in order to sufficiently inform the public regarding the exam and its requirements, including how to take the exam, as well as the contents and format of the exam".    The offeror's solution to this should be part of their proposals.

Question # 31: Inquiry regarding Question 20 (a) in Amendment 1 of TIRNO-05-R-00011  It is not possible for our organization to provide a comparable examination from any of our clients.  The examinations that we produce are high stakes, secure examinations.  It would be improper to disclose the examinations under any conditions, regardless of the security offered, to any entity.  We will protect the SEE with same diligence and never make it available to other entities.  We will provide references that can speak to the complexity and quality of the examinations that we develop.  Additionally, it will be possible to judge based on the professions for which we develop examinations the high standards required for our examination programs. We should not be disadvantaged because our examination programs are secure.

Answer # 31:  
Please revise the answer to Question # 20(a), given in Amendment 0001, to read: "If a vendor is unable to provide a sample of a previously prepared exam or a prototype example of the proposed examination, please provide a brief narrative describing the proposed type and format of the examination.

Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Also, please provide a brief description of the organization's vision for moving forward and interests related to technology.

Response: The Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J) Force Readiness is the official Department of Defense registry for all military units worldwide. It is the Department of Defense's "system of record" for providing the mandatory readiness status of all military units worldwide with respect to the quality and quantity of personnel and equipment. Unit status is continually updated, but by law must be updated at least once every 30 days. The Force Readiness system consists of the following three applications: Readiness Assessment System Input Tool, Status of Resources and Training System Database, and Readiness System Output Tool. The system must meet all J6 security requirements. J6 is the accreditation authority. Currently, GCCS-J Force Readiness is moving to a new block upgrade. This block upgrade, call Block V, focuses on establishing web-based functionality housed on an Oracle 10g/Solaris 10 architecture.

Respondents are reminded that the date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the Request for Information for Force Readiness Support Services is to respond to a question that has been raised. The date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

Question 1: Can we obtain more information on the block upgrade to Oracle 10g and Solaris 10?

Response: The Force Readiness mission application is a "system within a system" (or is a member of a "family of systems") that provide the Department of Defense (DoD) with its command and control capability. This overarching command and control capability is call Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J). Force Readiness is but one of many mission applications that reside under the GCCS-J "umbrella." The GCCS-J establishes the common operating environment upon which all mission applications must reside. As stated previously, Force Readiness is the authoritative system-of-record database for tracking the status (quality and quantity) of all equipment and personnel assigned to a formal UIC. In Block V, the GCCS-J Common Operating Environment will include Solaris 10 and Oracle 10g. The Force Readiness mission application (consisting of the input tool, output tool, and database) must be able to reside upon this foundational common operating environment. Block V this will be Oracle 10g and Solaris 10. At this time, Force Readiness will not be allowed to move off of this baseline.

Respondents are reminded the date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to a previous notice is to address additional questions that have been submitted. The date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this information. Information regarding the network architecture topology is available as two Power Point documents separately uploaded to FedBizOpps.

Question: In order to better understand and respond, could you please provide further detail into the following: network architecture topology; elaboration on the development environment (number of users, platforms, software and versions, etc.); and existing databases within the architecture to include: quantity within the network, vendor and database version for each location, primary application/functionality (financial, logistics, etc.), current and anticipated growth in size database size for each location, and current anticipated growth in users/queries for each location number of users for each location. Would the Government consider products other than Oracle 10g and Solaris that met and/or exceeded these requirements?

Response:

1) Additional Overview comments: The Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) is the central registry for all Operational Units in the Department of Defense. It is the single automated reporting system within DoD that provides the senior leadership with authoritative identification, location, assignment, personnel, and equipment data. It contains the condition and level of resources and training and the Commander's assessment of how the status of his/her resources and training levels affect the Unit's readiness status. Units report by exception with 24 hours of a change and submit validation reports if no changes occur within 30 days.

2) Network architecture topology: See two Power Point documents separately uploaded to FedBizOpps.

3) Elaboration on development environment: Force Readiness is split into three categories, as follows: the Readiness Assessment System Input Tool, the SORTS database, and the Readiness Assessment System Output Tool. Development activities are conducted at the current vendor's facility and the DISA Skyline laboratory, with testing occurring at the DISA Skyline laboratory and the Engineering/Integration suite at Northrop-Grumman. Currently, the Force Readiness architecture resides on Sun Fire V440 servers, hoping to move to Sun Fire V890 Servers. In February, SORTS released Version 4.0.2 and will be releasing Version 4.0.3 in October.

4) Quantity of databases within the network: The architecture contains two primary databases, the SORTS master database (containing current readiness data) and the Historical database (containing historical readiness data). The subcomponents of these databases are shown in the two Power Point documents separately uploaded to FedBizOpps.

5) Vendor and database version: The incumbent contractor has been previously identified in Modification 01. The Readiness Assessment System Input Tool and the SORTS database are on Version 4.0.3 and the Readiness Assessment Output Tool is on Version Global 4.0.1.

6) Primary application/functionality: described in overview statement above (statement 1).

7) Database location: The database serves the readiness reporting needs of Joint Staff, all Military Services (including Coast Guard), and all Combatant Commands. In performing this support, the SORTS master database is distributed by means of local GORAs (Global SORTS Oracle Client Database) to 39 locations worldwide. The User pool should remain relatively constant as we move into Block V.

8) Architecture Issues: Force Readiness is a "system within a system." It belongs to a family of command and control mission applications (to include COP, I3, SORTS, JOPES, etc.) based upon a Common Operational Environment established by the GCCS-J Systems Engineer. In order to stay consistent throughout the architecture, it is necessary for all mission applications to remain on the same architectural base - for

<DESC>There are two amendments to this synopsis. One, the solicitation for this requirement will be a cost type contract not fixed-priced. Second, the solicitation will be under the NAICS code of 518210 Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services and not 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. ----------------------Description:
CMS intends to award a 23-month cost-type contract, with no options, to a small business to assist CMS in performing data processing and medical reviews for the Medicaid Error Rate (MER) project.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Potential offerors are hereby advised that their accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and that FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations of Subcontracting will be incorporated into the solicitation and resultant contract.  
BACKGROUND: CMS must estimate improper payments in the Medicaid program as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).  The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress.  
The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.
To implement error rate measurement in Medicaid, CMS will use a national contracting strategy.  Under this strategy, CMS will engage three contractors: (1) a statistical contractor (posted to Fedbizopps.gov August 4, 2005); (2) a documentation/database contractor (posted to Fedbizopps.gov August 10, 2005); and (3) a review contractor.  The statistical contractor will perform all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions.  The documentation/database contractor will gather medical policies and other necessary information from states; will maintain a database of the medical policies (along with quarterly updates to these policies) and will gather medical records from providers.  All information collected by the documentation/database contractor will be maintained in electronic format.  The review contractor will use the policies and medical records obtained by the documentation/database contractor to perform the medical reviews, provide findings to the statistical contractor, jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor and submit the report to CMS.
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS: The successful offeror, as the review contractor, shall make a payment determination for each sampling unit by performing data processing reviews and medical reviews.  The review contractor shall review each sampling unit to determine if was processed through the claims payment system correctly, medically necessary, coded correctly and properly paid or denied.  The review contractor shall validate whether each sampling unit was paid correctly based on: information found on the sampling unit, the information in the medical record, the information in the claims processing system, and state policies.  The review contractor shall conduct the data processing reviews on-site for each state selected, visiting each state between two and five times.  The medical reviews may be performed at a central location.
The sampling unit is defined as an individually priced service (e.g., a physician office visit, a hospital stay, a month of enrollment in Medicare).  The sampling unit may be a claim or line item. It is estimated that between 800 – 1200 sampling units or an average of 1000, per state, will need to be reviewed to achieve 3% precision at the 95% confidence level. The contractor shall perform this work for one complete production, December 31, 2005, through November 30, 2007.  This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal late August 2005 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION ADDS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND CHANGES SEVERAL ITEMS IN THE ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IS PRINTED BELOW. FIRST THE ANNOUNCEMENT DATE IS EXTENDED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 23, 2005 FOR AWARD AND FOR RECEIPT OF CAPABILITY STATEMENTS. Secondly, this sole source procurement will not be awarded as a commercial item in accordance with FAR subpart 13.5. Next, the work statement is presented in more detail as follows: 
The contractor will provide technical assistance in extracting information about FDA’s field inspection and feed sampling activities and summarizing data on the occurrence of microbial, mycotoxin and pesticide contaminants in animal feeds.  These data are obtained from FACTS (Field Accomplishment and Compliance Tracking System) database as part of the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program.  Specifically, the contractor will extract the results of microbiological analyses of animal feed samples for FYs 2004 and 2005 from FACTS and summarize the information on excel spreadsheets.  The contractor will also extract results of mycotoxin analyses of feed samples for the second half of FY 2005, and will prepare a mid-year and annual report for FY2005.   The contractor will also prepare additional analyses of feed samples collected under the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program, as directed by the Project Manager; such analyses may include mycotoxin results for the first half of FY 2006, microbiological results for the first half of FY 2006, and pesticide results for FY 2005 and the first half of FY 2006. 

Additional information is provided as to why this will be awarded as a sole source procurement to Mr. Kaplan as set forth below. The Center for Veterinary Medicine's (CVM) Office of Surveillance and Compliance is responsible for planning and coordinating field inspection activities in general, and particularly for the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program.  Mr. Kaplan has extensive knowledge and experience with the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program, and has participated in CVM’s recent revision of that program; 3) Mr. Kaplan has knowledge and experience with the FACTS database and the software used by the field to record the results of inspections, feed sampling, and laboratory analyses; and 4) Mr. Kaplan has many years of experience in extracting the results of feed inspections from the FACTS database and evaluating the effectiveness of the compliance program, particularly with respect to pesticide, mycotoxin and microbiological contamination of animal feeds.  Because of this experience and knowledge, Mr. Kaplan will need no training in ORA/CVM workplanning activities, in CVM’s feed compliance programs, or in how to extract compliance program results from the FACTS database to analyze the effectiveness of the Center’s Feed Contaminants Compliance Program, and thus will be able to perform the identified work in the short amount of time allotted for these tasks in the contract.THIS ENDS THE MODIFICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. 

The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to Mr. Gil Kaplan for providing technical assistance in summarizing data on microbes, mycotoxins and pesticides in animal feeds. These data are obtained from FACTS (Field Accomplishment and Compliance Tracking system) as part of the Feed Contaminants Program. Mr. Kaplan has vast knowledge on pesticide and mycotoxin data in FACTS, as he previously compiled the data into a quarterly report for this FDA Center. NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. An award will be made within five (5) days from the date of this notice. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes that is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services within 5 days following the appearance of this announcement. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to Eosinski@fda.hhs.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.    This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition for commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

<DESC>Battelle, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is interested in receiving expressions of interest for the provision of well drilling and well casing services.  

Description:

Work will be performed in and around the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant construction site at the Hanford Site, Washington.  The work locations are not designated as hazardous waste sites.  Three separate work scopes are being considered

Work scope 1:  Approximately five (5) boreholes are to be drilled to target depths of approximately 1500 to 1700 feet.  A borehole diameter of 7-7/8 inches at total depth is currently planned to accommodate borehole-testing activities.  These boreholes are to be utilized for conducting geophysical logging and seismic testing activities.  Following the testing activities, the boreholes will be decommissioned.  Rotary coring may be conducted through the basalt interbeds for one or all boreholes.

Work scope 2:  Drilling a surface borehole and setting casing (i.e.; surface conductor casing) down to the top of the basalt at approximately 365 feet using a cable tool drilling method.  The surface casings are planned as a control method for potential issues related to unconfined aquifer conditions and unconsolidated geologic conditions encountered in the top 365-385 feet of overburden.

Work scope 3:  Pairing wireline core holes with one or more test boreholes.

Mud rotary drilling method will be utilized for the test boreholes and coring.  Drilling contractor(s) must be able to provide portable mud tanks and solids control system and be able to run a closed mud system.  

Drilling activities for the test boreholes will be conducted on a 24 hour, 7 days per week work schedule.  Up to two drilling rigs may be deployed to expedite schedule for completing the test boreholes and associated testing activities.  It is anticipated that approximately 60 working days will be required to complete each borehole. 

The current proposed schedule is to initiate placement of the surface conductor casing in late February 2006, followed with the commencement of the test borehole drilling by late March 2006.  The paired core holes would be placed following the completion of the test boreholes.

Other:

The expression of interest should be structured according to the following outline:

A)	State which of the three work scopes your firm is interested in (i.e., 1) test boreholes, 2) surface borehole and casing setting, 3) wireline coring). 
B)	Provide an overview of company capabilities, including the following:
1.	Small/large business status,
2.	General description of company capabilities,
3.	Experience with drilling Columbia River or similar basalts,
Section B shall not exceed 2 pages.
C)	Provide a summary of capabilities for each scope of work in which your company expressed.  For each applicable scope of work include the following:
1.	 Description of similar projects previously completed.  Include general project description, period of performance, contract value, and client name and phone number.
2.	Description of proposed drilling equipment, support equipment, and equipment availability.  Please provide specifications and performance capabilities of proposed equipment.
Section C shall not exceed 3 pages for each scope of work.

Contract Specialist:

The above information should be provided to Kathleen Whelan at PNNL, P. O. Box 999, Richland, WA 99352 or Facsimile (509) 372-4334 by October 14, 2005.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego (FISCSD) is seeking commercial sources capable of providing television and high-speed Internet services to Navy and Marine Corps (N/MC) locations within the San Diego metropolitan area. The FISCSD intends to award one or more ten-year Franchise Agreements and follow-on annual contracts to procure the required Cable television services. The level of services expected for the life of the Franchise Agreement(s) will be comparable to services available to the public and surrounding communities. BACKGROUND: Currently, the Government is receiving cable service under a franchise agreement with Americable serving approximately 6,000 total subscribers that is set to expire 8 October 2006. The current customer base is comprised of: ·	Centrally funded Navy organizations on Bases ·	Private Navy personnel on-Base residential accounts. The existing cable service provides an estimated 60 basic channels, 10 premium channels and government channels. The Navy and Marine Corps seek a cost-effective commercial solution for the installation and servicing of cable television and related unofficial services. The proposed system/services can be provided via any medium (i.e., cable, satellite, etc.), depending on the contractor’s best technical solution for satisfying the requirements. Satellite services do not require a Franchise Agreement, so award to a satellite service provider will proceed directly to the contracting phase.

<DESC>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT:  The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for a new six-year multi-center clinical trial, Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT).   The Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT) is a randomized controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of around-the-clock, supplemental oxygen therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and moderately severe hypoxemia.  The ultimate goal of the NHLBI is to improve clinical management of COPD, with increased length and quality of life for patients with COPD.  It is estimated that data will be collected from approximately 5,000 subjects and that it will include demographics, medical history, medications, results of clinical laboratory tests, and responses to questionnaires.  Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled over a 30 month period at each of approximately 20 Regional Clinical Centers (RCCs) solicited under a separate request for proposal.  Subjects will be followed for up to 42 months.  One or more substudies that enhance the scientific value of the parent trial will also be performed in this program.  Substudies may be conducted at all RCCs or at only a subset of the RCCs.  Substudies will be selected and designed by the Substudy Subcommittee of the Steering Committee.  The DCC will: 1) provide biostatistical support for protocol development, including power and sample size calculations and simulations; for study monitoring; and for the analysis of study data;  2) administrative guidance, oversight, and support for the LOTT as a whole; promoting interactions among the RCCs and assuring uniformity of study activities at all sites; 3) make travel arrangements and reimbursement to the Steering Committee chair; 4) make travel arrangements and reimbursement to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) members; 4) coordinate, plan, make arrangements for, and participate in the meetings of the Steering Committee and its subcommittees and of the DSMB; 5) prepare and distribute minutes of the Steering Committee and DSMB meetings; 6) establish and maintain a computer system and software needed for the storage and analysis of study data; 7) develop and maintain a study web site for the distribution of LOTT information, documents, and forms to the RCCs, 8) develop and maintain a public web site that provides information about the LOTT for the lay public; 9) prepare and distribute periodic technical and statistical reports to the participating RCCs, the project officer, a CMS representative and the contracting officer, 10) review, at least weekly, study plans, procedures, activities, and data to ensure the scientific validity and clinical relevance of the trial and the protection of human subject safety and privacy, and 11) monitor adverse event reports for patterns of safety or toxicity that may warrant changes in the study.  The DCC will frequently need to make quick decisions, often based on medical information obtained from the clinics.  Therefore, staff will need to possess strong medical and scientific qualifications and experience relating to COPD.  The DCC’s medical monitor should be board-certified in pulmonary medicine, have expertise in the clinical management of COPD, and experience in clinical research.  The DCC must have experience with complex multi-center trials, readily available pulmonary medical expertise, and the ability to analyze a large volume of physiologic, quality of life, medical morbidity and mortality data.  This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer at the above noted address.  The capabilities statement submitted in response to this synopsis shall include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientist, medical expert, and technical personnel in accordance with the above outline requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, and 4) an outline of previous multi-center research projects in which the small business organization and the proposed personnel have participated and any other information considered relevant to this program.  The information provided must also establish the institution’s status as a small business.  Three copies of the capabilities statement must be received at the address listed in this announcement.  If this program is approved for implementation and it is determined to be a small business set aside, then a competitive RFP will be set aside for small business concerns.  The RFP will be available in FedBizOpps and electronically via the NHLBI Website.

<DESC>Drug Interaction Checker for Consumers
Release Date:  September 19, 2005
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
National Library of Medicine

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION -  Drug Interaction Checker for Consumers

This Request For Information (RFI)/Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  The purpose of this RFI/SS is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  NLM welcomes comments from all individuals on each or all of these questions.  The NLM does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NLM’s   use of such information.   Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NLM’s evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this RFI/SS, the NLM may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  In the event a RFP will be issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519,541511 or 511210 may apply.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the NLM shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the NLM’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. 

Request for Information: 

The NLM seeks input and comment on a drug interaction checker for users of its MedlinePlus consumer health web site.  MedlinePlus already provides information on individual drugs and classes of drugs, and users access these pages over 3 million times per month on average.  The pages include information on side effects and precautions but at this time, MedlinePlus has no section where a user can type in or select medications and receive information on possible interactions and their severity.

To aid in the design of a possible future solicitation, we ask that interested organizations submit comments on the following issues: 

1.  Do you have a commercially available drug interaction checker written for a consumer audience? If so, is the interaction checker available for viewing on any public web site?
2.  What measures do you use to calibrate the reading level of the information you are providing?
3.  If you have a drug interaction checker but it is not written for a consumer audience, would you consider adapting it for such an audience?
4.  How many substances are listed in the interaction checker? Does the interaction checker include prescription drugs? Over-the-counter drugs? Brand names? Generic names?
5.  Does the interaction checker also include information about interactions with nutrients, dietary supplements, alcohol, and herbals? If so, can users include or exclude results for these categories? 
6.  What is the source of the drug interaction checker? Do you develop it in-house or do you acquire the data from another organization?
7.  Who writes the information? What are the qualifications of the person(s) who does the writing? If the interaction checker is available for viewing on a public web site, are the contributors listed there?
8.  Does the interaction checker list the sources of information that are used in 
    a. general preparation of the interaction information?
    b. specific sources for information for each interaction?
9.  Does the interaction checker list the potential severity of interactions? If it does, on what basis is the severity rating based?
10.  Does the interaction checker include a description of symptoms associated with an interaction? 
11.  Does the interaction checker recommend any course of action or management of interactions? Does the information stipulate that it does not constitute medical advice and to consult a health professional?
12.  In what languages other than English is the interaction checker available?
13.  Can users enter multiple drugs? How do they enter them—type in names (if so, is a spellchecker available), pick from a list (if so, are multiple formulations available and are generics as well as brand names available)?
14.  Does the interaction checker allow a user to see all of the potential interactions of an individual drug?
15.  How is the information updated? How often is it updated?
16.  What are the provisions for emergency updating of content?
17.  How is content delivered technically? Do you provide an application program interface (API) for other organizations or do you provide data to other organizations that are then responsible for programming?
18.  Is the interaction checker integrated with any other drug information product? If so, please describe.
19.  Based on the current use of MedlinePlus drug pages, can you give us an estimate of what it would cost to license your interaction checker? NLM prefers flat fee licenses.
20.  Based on the description provided in this RFI, what NAICS code would the proposed drug interaction checker best qualify as? 

NLM welcomes responses from all individuals and organizations on each or all of these questions.  Responses should be limited to approximately one (1) page per question, and are due October 19, 2005.  


Sources Sought: 

Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 10 pages that details the ability to perform the aspects of the effort described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit hospital, or other nonprofit organization, in their response.  

Responses should be identified with NLM-RFI2006-01, and are due by October 19, 2005.  Please submit three (3) copies of your response to the attention of: Sally Boakye, Contract Specialist, The National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisition Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bldg. 38A, Room B1N17, Bethesda, MD 20894.

<DESC>Spacecraft Bus for the ST-9 Solar Sail Request for Information 1.   Introduction This Request for Information is for a Spacecraft bus that shall meet the requirements for the ST-9 Solar Sail  mission. 2.   Mission Requirements Due to the nature of solar sails (low-thrust propulsion), total on-orbit mass is a critical parameter. Responders to this RFI are strongly encouraged to propose the minimum mass bus that meets the mission requirements as given below. Mission Life: 3 months minimum, additional 3 months extended mission Orbit: Sun-synchronous, circular: minimum altitude 1000 km, target 1500 km  Orbit determination: DSN range and range rate, GPS, other approaches under study Payload Characteristics (includes 30% margin): •	Power: 82 W Average; 153 W Peak  •	Mass: 69 kg  •	Data rate: 27.5 kbps Average; 2.65 Mbps peak Communications and Data Handling: •	Continuous real-time coverage required during sail deployment ( ~ 2 hours)  •	S-Band, 2 kbps uplink, downlink 2.25 Mbps to GN or commercial sites, possible DSN and/or TDRSS SSA if needed during continuous coverage •	2 omni antennae for near-spherical coverage •	Payload data storage: 500 Mbits after 50:1 compression of SIMS data (Compression performed within the SIMS, or optionally by the bus C&DH) Attitude Control (before and after sail deployment): The bus Attitude Control System (ACS) shall be required to perform pointing maneuvers when the ST-9 Solar Sail is not under sail control. The four types of maneuvers are a 3-axis stabilized inertial hold without actuator resultant forces, a Local Vertical Local Horizontal (LVLH) hold with the Z axis nadir pointing, orbit maneuvering, and a Safe-hold that will point the X axis toward the Sun.  •	Pointing control: ~ 0.5° •	Pointing stability: ~ 0.5° •	Pointing knowledge: ~ 0.1°  (may need more precise knowledge if the ST-9 Solar Sail Project determines that accelerometers are required) •	Sail inertial properties (deployed): Ix = 8000 kg*m^2, Iy = Iz = 4000 kg*m^2  •	Gravity gradient is the dominant external torque The bus ACS shall monitor the sail attitude and resume control from the sail ACS in the event of a large attitude error. Radiation Total Dosage:  5 krads Propulsion System: For this mission, the Pegasus XL is the base-lined launch vehicle.  The ST-9 Solar Sail requires a liquid fuel (mono-propellant hydrazine) propulsion system capable of providing a total &#8710;V of  ~ 400 m/s (for a 220 x 1000 km initial orbit), or ~ 650 m/s (for a 220 x 1500 km initial orbit).  The liquid propulsion system will be used for launch vehicle dispersion correction maneuver, reduction of tip-off rates, perigee raising and orbit circularization, backup attitude control, backup momentum dumping, and end-of-mission disposal via perigee lowering to 450 km.  3.	Background Information  The ST-9 Solar Sail mission background, top-level schedule, mission objectives, and payload element parameters, configuration concepts are described in Attachment 1.

<SUBJECT>B--Notice of Sole Source Award for Experience Based Producer Discounts Program
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a sole source award to Signal Solutions Inc.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency (RMA).  Experience Based Producer Discounts Program is a follow-on of existing work that has been or going and the issuance of a new Rate Discount Structure program would negate the work completed to date.   RMA has determined that continued development of this Program is necessary. This new contract is for completion of the Rate Discount Structure.  Since Signal Solutions Inc. was the original provider of the Experience Based Producer Discounts Program and was unable to complete the work required in the original time allocated to re-procure this work would negate the work that has been completed to date.  Awarding the contract to another vendor at this point would most likely result in duplication of work, effort, time and cost to the Government.  To bring a new vendor in at this crucial time would impede the progress the Discount Rate Program; the learning curve for the new vendor would delay completion of the actuarial process by a minimum of one year.  The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  However, all information received within five (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>Q -- CRNA SERVICES
<DESC>This notice is posted IAW FAR 8.402(f).  The Government intends to award a contract for certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) services to Spectrum Healthcare Resources against Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) V797P-4530a.  The Government solicited competitive quotes for CRNA services using the GSA e-buy system.  As part of the request for quote (RFQ), regular weekday services and on-call weekday and weekend services were solicited.  While the basic CRNA services required by the RFQ are part of Spectrum’s FSS schedule, the on-call services are not.  However, it is the Government’s intention to award the on-call services to Spectrum as part of the contract for weekday CRNA services.  The on-call services have been determined fair and reasonable based on the competitive proposals received in response to the GSA e-buy RFQ.  Further, to ensure the most effective management of CRNA services, and to afford Scott AFB medical patients the most efficient medical care, the Government will award the on-call services as part of the basic contract with Spectrum to provide regular weekday services.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A CASCADED OPTICAL PARAMETRIC CHIPED PULSE AMPLIFIER
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A CASCADED OPTICAL PARAMETRIC CHIPED PULSE AMPLIFIER

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to build a Cascaded Optical Parametric Chirped Pulse Amplifier (COPA).

LLNL has developed a novel Cascaded Optical Parametric Chirped Pulse Amplifier.  This COPA uses double-pass optical parametric amplifier design, which uses a single pump pulse and a single periodically poled nonlinear crystal.  The design also overcomes many prior energy and contrast limitations due to parametric fluorescence.  The COPA provides excellent prepulse suppression.   

The COPA uses a double pass cascaded design which removes all prepulses occurring earlier than the characteristic pump pulse duration.  It is based on the fact that a OPCPA (optical parametric chirped pulse amplification) generates a chirped idler pulse.  Since this idler is generated only in the parametric process, it carries no prepulses preceding the main signal pulse if they are not contained within the pump temporal window.  This idler pulse central wavelength is different from the signal central wavelength and its spectral phase dispersion is incompatible with recompression using a matched stretcher-compressor pair.  However, the cascaded design sends this idler pulse back through the crystal for a second optical parametric amplification stage.  The difference-frequency generation process in the second amplification generates the second idler pulse, which has the exact temporal and spectral characteristics of the original signal pulse, except that all the pre- and post-pulses have been removed.  

The design also uses periodically poled nonlinear materials, which provide significant advantages over bulk nonlinear materials.  The design overcomes past limitations of designs using periodically pulled materials to provide high gain (>107), low fluorescence, high beam quality, and high conversion efficiency.  The COPA promises to be useful in telecommunications as an amplifier/switch or as a pre-amplifier and prepulse cleaner for a high-power pulsed laser.

Please visit the IPAC website at 
http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Cascaded Optical Parametric Chirped Pulse Amplifier should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Optical Parametric Chirped Pulse Amplifier.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

An addendum to this provision is applicable, in which the term offeror, whenever it appears, shall be replaced with the term quoter. Also, paragraphs (g) and (h) of FAR 52.212-1 are deleted. Local Fort Lewis clauses 52.111-4131, Commercial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate P rogram, 52.111-4132, Identification of Contractors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, and 52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to this acquisition. Local clause 52.111-4131 states: Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject t o change without prior notice. Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342). (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor' s Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday throu gh Friday, excluding federal holidays. These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours. These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays. On Saturdays, Sunday s, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5). Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained. All commercial vehicles will be searched. The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post. The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis. If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of  cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given p riority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12 foot-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis. Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate. Drivers needing access to No rth Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12 foot-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis. The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label. The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis. (b) If the con tractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta. During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicle s must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate. All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the  Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes. Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, th e DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate. The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes. (c ) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contra cting Officer. Local clause 52.111-4132 states: a. Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis. A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week. Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or wh o do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed). The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time. A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program. The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program. b. The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis. The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any s et-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card. If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee. If the CHBC is adverse, the F AGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee. If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, i f the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee. c. If an employee no longer needs an iden tification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change. If the identification badge cannot be re turned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up i n writing the next workday. An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract. T he FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor. Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this cont ract. d. Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees. If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, the ft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered. e. Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract. The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless prec luded by OSHA regulation(s). The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued. f. The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the cont ract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for. g. If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access t o the installation. Local clause 52.111-4004 states: In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing e lectronic mail.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
	
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity, does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
	
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity, does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT.  ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:

The actual time period is six and one-half days, starting on Tuesday and spread over seven days, with one of those instructional days on Saturday.  (The first day is used for non-AMP LITE topics.)  Based on the previous year, none of the AMP LITE topics had a guest speaker, What the students saw were seven (7) different Ph.D. business management instructors, one for each separate day.  Each of these Ph.D. instructors had different, but high level academic/consulting specializations.  The contract last year did authorize "guest speakers" so long as they were under the direction of another Ph.D. instructor and had similar qualifications to the person inviting them.  The bottom line is that the person teaching the topic must have the expertise and experience to competently and enthusiastically deliver the topic.  Lunch for the students is a part of the course structure and it does occur at noon.  The instructor may purchase lunch and eat with the students. 


All requirements are considered new, even if there was a previous contract.  The incumbent on the previous contract was Bylinski Consulting.  Any further information would have to be requested via FOIA.  The incumbent can bid on this solicitation.  This is not GSA, yes citizenship is a requirement.  This is a small business set aside under SAP.  I am the buyer.
