<SUBJECT>Validate II: Vascular Aging-The Link that Bridges Age to Atherosclerosis
<SOLNBR>NIH-AG-2011-157
<RESPDATE>120511
<CONTACT>Sara Mclaurin, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2696, Email mclaurinsm@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 15, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis with Johns Hopkins University for a project entitled "Validate II: Vascular Aging: The Link that Bridges Age to Atherosclerosis."
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be for a two (2) year period of performance.</p>
<p>In spite of unprecedented advances in the diagnosis and management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, it remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This disease disproportionately affects older individuals and its incidence, prevalence, and severity all markedly increase with age. The VALIDATE study is a seminal research initiative designed by the NIA to address the critical questions of why and how aging is associated with an increased prevalence of atherosclerotic disease. The study was begun seven years ago and has successfully studied 498 participants. The purpose of this contract is to complete the remaining "second visits" for 294 participants. These participants were first seen in VALIDATE I in order to examine the longitudinal changes in vascular properties and body composition by enhanced vascular EBCT and MRI in Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) participants.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is uniquely qualified to perform this work due to its unique access to this cohort of subjects. Since JHU began this study seven (7) years ago, successfully studying 498 participants, they have established relationships with the participants who are part of the BLSA study, of which the average age of whom is 71. In addition to having an established relationship with JHU, these elderly participants are familiar with the procedures required under the study and with JHU's study location. A second, final visit is necessary in order to complete the study for the remaining 294 participants; however, there is a potential risk of study participants discontinuing participation in the study if a different contractor is used. Any attempt to secure services from other than JHU could significantly reduce the response rates for interviews and required scans, and thus jeopardize the scientific aims and productivity of the research. Therefore, it is not feasible or cost effective to have another contractor go through the process of establishing new working relationships in order to complete the research. Also of concern is that any contractor completing this study must have the identical CT scanning equipment, Toshiba Aquilion One, 320 slice scanner, that was used for the participants' initial visits, so that longitudinal changes can be directly assessed without the need to perform a comparability evaluation. The incumbent contractor has this equipment and has used it for the first scans. In addition, by using the same set of clinical readers, inter-reader variability can be removed as a source of potential error when evaluating the study results.</p>
<p>If another contractor were to complete the study, a significant increase in the period of performance would be required, along with additional costs, for another contractor to enroll new participants in order to maintain the cohort size, to accomplish both the initial scans for new participants, and the second scans required. A new contractor would be unable to meet the same efficiency levels that Johns Hopkins University has established at this stage of completion of the study. Finally, as the incumbent contractor, Johns Hopkins has the required experience performing EBCT and safety practices associated with radioactive studies. Levels of expertise in these clinical and administrative areas must be commensurate with that of the readers for the first portion of the study so that the two are comparable. JHU meets these criteria. Under the requirements of 41 U.S.C. 253[c](1) and FAR 6.302-1, JHU is the only source capable of meeting the requirements of this project.</p>
<p>The requirements of VALIDATE II are as follows: The contractor shall perform high resolution, non-contract CT images of the heart, coronary arteries, and proximal great vessels and provide Agatston calcium volume scores, and use the data obtained to construct a chronologic age/calcium score relationship and physiologic vascular age/calcium score relationship. Facilitate comparison of the participant data obtained in the "first visit" under the predecessor contract (VALIDATE), with data obtained during the "second visit" under this requirement (VALIDATE II) in order to determine the rate of progression of coronary artery calcification. Support analysis of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the common and internal carotid arteries conducted in the predecessor contract and integration of this data into measures of body composition. Measure serologic markers and determine genetic polymorphisms in the study cohort that may influence the physiologic vascular measurements and the development of atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-11-157 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-11-157.</p>
<p>The estimated contract award date will be on or about March 1, 2012.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE) intends to procure depot level manufacture, repair and refurbishment of Aviation Armament Equipment (AAE), specifically the P-3C Wing Station and Weapons Bay Pylons for the Taiwan Navy (TN) and United States Navy (USN). This effort will provide for the depot level overhaul, repair refurbishment and Digital Stores Management System (DSMS) upgrade of Wing Station (WS) and Weapons Bay (WB) Pylons and the acquisition of wing spacers, BRU-15/A and BRU 12/A bomb racks and associated hardware necessary to configure up to 12 Taiwan P-3C aircraft plus spares. The USN requirement is for the upgrade and repair of Maverick Wing Pylon Assemblies currently in a Non-Ready for Issue (RFI) status. The P-3C DSMS is designed to replace existing armament system Kill Stores, Torpedo, Harpoon Aircraft Command Launch Control System (HACLCS) and Kill Stores System while providing growth capability to control MIL-STD-1760D Class II stores at 12 weapon stations (6 Wing Station, 6 Weapons Bay Stations). DSMS will provide the same weapon capability as currently provided in the legacy P-3C armament system with the exception of specific weapon capabilities not releasable to FMS operators. The US Navy did not incorporate the DSMS functionality into the P-3C AIP aircraft. The pylons do not have the MIL-STD-1760D capability and remain in the original Maverick configuration.
<p>It is anticipated that the contract will be fixed price, and the government intends to procure a minimum quantity of 1 First Article Test; 1 DSMS Wing Station Pylon Assembly Ship-set; 1 Heavy Weight Weapons Bay Pylon Assembly Ship-set; 1 Light Weight Weapons Bay Pylon Assembly Ship-set for the TN aircraft and 12 Maverick Wing Pylon Assemblies and 5 Wing Station Pylon Spacer Ship-sets for the USN to be purchased with the first Delivery Order. After successful completion of First Article Testing (FAT), the government plans to issue delivery orders over 4 years for up to 13 complete DSMS Maverick capable Wing Station Pylon Assembly Ship-sets, up to 13 complete Heavy Weight Weapons Bay Pylon Assembly Ship-sets, up to 13 complete Light Weight Weapons Bay Pylon Assembly Ship-sets, two (2) spare Wing Station Pylon Spacer Ship-sets, six (6) BRU-15/A Bomb Racks, six (6) BRU-12/A Bomb Racks for the TN aircraft and up to 94 Maverick Wing Pylon Assemblies and 5 complete spare Wing Station Pylon Spacer Ship-sets for the USN. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued as a total small business set-aside. The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil. Select Doing Business and then Open Solicitations. Look for amendments on the web page. Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors.

This is an RFI for planning purposes only, as part of a market survey led by PMS-408, EOD/CREW Program Office, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).  This is not a Request for Proposal.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.


Background
The Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) initiative has met urgent and compelling operational requirements to counter the threat posed by Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) in order to reduce combat fatalities during Operation New Dawn (OND) (formerly Operation Iraqi Freedom) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  This has resulted in a number of urgent procurements over the past several years.  


PMS 408, EOD/CREW provides the military services with an electronic warfare capability to counter the threat from Radio-Controlled IEDs (RCIED).
 The current CREW Systems include three distinct variants that utilize common hardware, software, and firmware components.  These variants consist of: dismounted systems (man-portable), mounted systems (ground and waterborne), and fixed site systems (semi-permanent geographical area and fixed).   The current CREW systems are fielded in support of OND and OEF.  


PMS-408 EOD/CREW is searching for companies that have demonstrated past performance in the engineering, production, maintenance, and support of electro-mechanical systems that will support the current PMS 408 portfolio of CREW systems.  The portfolio of CREW systems includes, but is not limited to, the AN/PLQ-9(V)1, AN/PLT-2, AN/PLT-5, CVRJ(V1), CVRJ(V2), Mini-Titan, and Universal Test Set.
 Qualified respondents should have the ability to provide engineering service support, depot maintenance support, spare parts and consumables, engineering change proposals, technology insertion and refresh, obsolescence management support, logistics management information, and demilitarization and disposal of the CREW portfolio of systems.  Qualified respondents should be able to fabricate electro-mechanical systems when provided a technical data package (TDP), applicable software/firmware, and an operational system and have the ability and production capacity to rapidly ramp up a production line.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This announcement represents a Request for Information (RFI) by the F-15 Division, WPAFB, OH to determine potential sources for a state of the art, wide bandwidth, highly integrated digital electronic warfare system with extensive leveraging of commercial off-the-shelf components and availability for increased growth through firmware and software reprogramming. The USAF is investigating a replacement for the existing F-15 Tactical Electronic Warfare Systems (TEWS) which includes the ALR-56C, ALQ-135, and ALE-45. The Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) upgrade will significantly improve the F-15's capability to autonomously and automatically detect, identify, locate, deny, degrade, disrupt, and defeat RF and EO/IR threat systems in mid-level to non-permissive environments in the 2015 to 2025 timeframe. <br /><br />PURPOSE: <br /><br />This notice is part of Government Market Research, a process for obtaining the latest information on the &lsquo;art of possible' from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. All company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked and properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition so as to not inadvertently restrict competition. <br /><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities (FedbizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br /><br />OBJECTIVES:<br /><br />The objectives of this RFI are to identify responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet requirements. For the purpose of this RFI, the term "proven" means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 in accordance with the Technology Readiness Assessment Guide dated April 2011. Please provide justification for hardware TRL as well as algorithm and software maturity that your company claims. <br /><br />BACKGROUND:<br /><br />The current F-15C/D and F-15E Electronic Warfare (EW) internal self-protection suite was designed to permit operations in environments defended by 1980s-era radar based ground and air threats. The EPAWSS upgrade will significantly improve the F-15's capability to autonomously and automatically detect, identify, locate, deny, degrade, disrupt, and defeat RF and EO/IR threat systems in mid-level to non-permissive environments in the 2015 to 2025 timeframe. <br /><br />OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS:<br /><br />The EPAWSS is intended to improve F-15 survivability by enhancing the ability to detect, deny or defeat air and ground threats throughout mid-level to non-permissive threat environments. The EPAWSS will enable the following: <br /><br />&bull; Detect, Identify (ID), and Locate Threats. The ability to provide indication, type, and position of airborne and ground-based radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) threats with the situational awareness needed to avoid, engage, or negate the threat.<br />&bull; Deny, Degrade, and Disrupt Threats. The ability to prevent a RF and EO/IR threat system from detecting or acquiring accurate targeting information prior to threat engagement. Necessary components include chaff, flares, decoys and jamming to complicate and/or negate an enemy threat targeting solution. <br />&bull; Defeat Threats. The ability to effectively counter enemy missiles/weapons once adversary threat systems engage and employ weapons against friendly forces through the use of chaff, flares, decoys, jamming, etc. <br />The new system must be capable of being operated and maintained by Air Force flight-line maintenance personnel with minimal steps to access key operational LRUs. Data must be available for operations, depot level repair and troubleshooting of the system. <br /><br />REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br />The F-15 Division will require evidence of development in all of the following areas:<br /><br />&bull; Interoperability with RF emitters and receivers (ex. AESA Radars, missile data links)<br />&bull; High Performance EW Receivers (Bandwidth, Sensitivity, Selectivity) <br />&bull; Ability to perform in a high pulse density environment<br />&bull; Ability to meet performance requirements in presence of RF Background Environment<br />(White commercial signals, grey and blue signals in addition to the red signals of interest)<br />&bull; Advanced complex jamming techniques and directional jamming ability<br />&bull; Multi-threat engagement<br />&bull; Programmable performance via software and mission files<br />&bull; Programmability of chaff and flare sequences using current USAF expendables<br />&bull; Antenna performance sufficient to detect, degrade, or defeat threats in order to provide improved survivability<br />&bull; Effective Antenna performance at multiple polarizations<br />&bull; Geolocation ability<br />&bull; Reduction of presentation of false alarms<br />&bull; Providing omnidirectional intra-flight data link capability as part of the EW system<br />&bull; Coordinated multi-ship detection, tracking and ID capability<br />&bull; Low latency response time<br />&bull; Ability to communicate high speed data over Fibre Channel / Gigabit Ethernet<br />&bull; Advanced multi-core/multi-processor architectures<br />&bull; Open system architecture<br />&bull; Ability to provide embedded training<br />&bull; Data recording and transfer ability<br />&bull; Experience with Anti-Tamper technology<br />&bull; Ability to meet Information Assurance requirements<br />&bull; High reliability electronic systems<br />&bull; Maintainability considerations during design<br />&bull; Availability of data for operation, maintenance and repair (organizational and depot)<br />&bull; Ability to balance Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Cost<br />&bull; Large growth capacity<br />Any proposed solution must meet all Operational, Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E) requirements mandated by the Department of Defense. <br />*Note: Access to classified information is not required to respond to this RFI; however, in the event a RFP is issued in the future, the program will require access to SECRET/SPECIAL ACCESS REQUIRED and higher as well as facility clearances. <br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS<br /><br />Interested parties should provide capabilities, qualification statements, and examples that demonstrate their ability to satisfy the requirements detailed in the REQUIREMENTS paragraph of this announcement.

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>Global Positioning Systems Directorate (SMC/GP) - Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) Extension of Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) Contract No. FA8807-07-C0002</p>
<p>Air Force Space Command, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Global Positioning Systems Directorate (SMC/GP), 483 North Aviation Boulevard, El Segundo, California, 90245-2808 intends to issue a sole source contract action to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), S&amp;R and Intelligence Systems Services, Los Angeles, California, 90056-1299, to provide Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) support services to SMC/GP for up to 15 months beginning no earlier than 9 March 2012. This contract action will effectively extend the period of performance of the SE&amp;I services currently being acquired under Contract FA8807-07-C-0002, thereby providing SMC/GP sufficient time to complete a source selection and award a long-term follow-on contract. Unless the award decision for the follow-on contract is protested, after award of that long-term follow-on contract, SMC/GP will not exercise any remaining options and will terminate for convenience the remaining period of performance of the contract action that is the subject of this synopsis. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 5.207(e), the classification code for this synopsis is 18 (Space Vehicles). Pursuant to FAR Section 5.207(c)(6), approximately 442,235 hours will be acquired for Systems Engineering and Integration using 3600 appropriations, and approximately 22,654 hours will be acquired for Systems Engineering and Integration using 3020 appropriations. A copy of the existing Statement of Work (SOW) is appended herewith for reference.</p>
<p>This contract provides a highly capable SE&amp;I contractor/team to produce and manage the GPS technical baseline in support of SMC/GP. The SE&amp;I's role in the accomplishment of this mission will involve, but is not limited to, development and implementation of directives and standards, improved and dynamic communications, new tools and techniques to predict issues early enough to change the outcome or minimize the effect on the enterprise, disciplined processes to develop and maintain the systems baseline documents and interfaces, and performance metrics that ensure continuous integration and operational capability improvements (measures of effectiveness). The current contract was awarded 9 March 2007. All options have been exercised and the contract will expire on 8 March 2012.</p>
<p>This contract action will be awarded to SAIC S&amp;R and Intelligence Systems Services as the only responsible source that can continue to provide these highly specialized services, as it is likely that award to any other source would result in the Air Force incurring substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition, experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements, or both. (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)).</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) no later than 15 days after posting of the subject notice/Sources Sought Synopsis, which shall be considered by the agency. The SOC must include the following information: Company Name, Mailing Address, Point of Contact and Telephone Numbers, Business Size Classification (Large, Small, or Other), Personnel/Size Standard and experience-specific work previously performed or being performed relevant to this follow-on effort. Interested parties must demonstrate in their SOC they have the capability to provide the systems and services to fulfill the government's immediate, short-term need for the projects described above. Interested parties must also demonstrate how an alternative approach can be cost competitive with the long term sustainment activities described above. The SOC shall not exceed 10 single-spaced pages.</p>
<p>This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The government will not pay any costs associated with the submittal of information solicited herein. The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such. No classified information shall be submitted. Verbal responses will not be accepted. Responses from small business and small disadvantaged business firms with the capability and capacity to perform this requirement are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.</p>
<p>Any response submitted by respondents to this synopsis constitutes consent for that submission to be reviewed by government personnel, Federally Funded Research and Development Center employees and Advisory &amp; Assistance Services contractor employees supporting SMC/GP, unless the respondent clearly objects in writing to the release of this information to Federally Funded Research and Development Contractor employees and Advisory &amp; Assistance Services contractor employees supporting SMC/GP, in a cover letter accompanying your capabilities package.</p>
<p>This notice expires 15 days after publication.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army PEO-EIS Technology Applications Office (TAO) is requesting information from responsible sources and commercial agencies concerning video transcoder products that are or will be available.<br><br>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The information provided may be used by TAO in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. The Government does not guarantee any action beyond this RFI.<br><br>Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. TAO is requesting industry comment on its ability to provide non-developmental, multi-functional devices with the maximum number of attributes as described below. Those not able to provide all preferred features are still encouraged to submit information on the features currently available in their products and propose an applicable schedule for those features that are planned for the future. <br><br>The intent of this RFI is to understand what products are or will be available in the video transcoder market.  As video source systems become more complex and user needs and capabilities become more disparate, there is a need to develop network centric and convenient means to meet different objectives.  A transcoder offers a partial solution to the problem.  In the example below, a typical transcoding scenario is described:<br><br>A video transcoder ingests a UDP multicast MPEG-2 TS with an H.264 elementary stream consisting of 1280x720p, 30fps video at 6 Mbps and a KLV metadata elementary stream consisting of MISB STD 0601 metadata.  No audio is present.  The transcoder produces a UDP multicast MPEG-2 TS with an H.264 elementary stream consisting of 720x480p, 30fps at 1.3 Mbps and the same KLV metadata elementary stream, and maintains PTS synchronization between the H.264 and KLV elementary streams.  Additional latency due to the transcode process is preferably less than 250ms and no more than 500 ms. Loss of video interpretability or intelligence is no greater than one V-NIIRS level at this level of transcoding. <br><br>Interested parties shall respond within 2 weeks after release of this RFI, and describe existing or near-term mature capabilities, features or products that meet or exceed those in the aforementioned scenario. A written response shall address which of the following list of capabilities are supported and describe the vendor's approach, support, and limitations for these capabilities and any unique or special variations or extensions to these capabilities. <br> <br> 	Supported Video transcoding (transcode pairs supported)<br>o	Example: H.264 to H.264, H.264 to MPEG-2, MPEG-4 to MPEG-2, MJPEG to H.264, etc.<br> 	Encoding Control options <br>o	Example: Frame Rate, Quality, GOP, I-B-P formats, Scalable Video Codec, multiple bit rate encoding, etc. <br> 	Rate Control options<br>o	Example:  VBR, CBR, etc.<br> 	Data Transport Protocols (receive and transmit)<br>o	Example: MPEG-2 TS, RTSP, RTP, Serial, etc.<br> 	Input Formats<br>o	Example:  UDP/IP, SDI, Analog, etc.<br> 	Output Formats<br>o	Example:  UDP/IP, ASI, etc.<br> 	Video Stream Performance<br> 	Number of Simultaneous Transcoded Streams<br>o	Example: 10 HD streams, etc.<br> 	Max Bandwidth (if applicable)<br>o	Example: 100 Mbps total throughput, maximum 10 Mbps per stream, etc.<br> 	Total System Latency <br>o	Example: <250ms at 30 fps, etc.<br> 	Output Stream Options<br>o	Example: change # of TS per IP, Bit-rate change @ 1 kbps, etc.<br> 	Management Interfaces (and security options)<br>o	Example: Web GUI, Terminal, Telnet, etc.<br> 	Storage capabilities for real-time stream storage:<br>o	Example:  SAS, 500GB, 10k  RPM<br> 	Video Processing capabilities<br>o	Example: scaling, cropping, letterboxing, stabilization, filtering, etc. <br> 	Supported Metadata format and metadata embedding methods<br>o	Example: KLV, ESD, CC/Line 21, MPEG-2 TS, VANC, metadata manipulation<br> 	Supported standards<br>o	Example: MISB, SMPTE, ITU-T, ISO, etc.<br> 	Physical Interfaces (Input and output and function)<br>o	Example: 6 Ethernet ports 10/100/1000 BaseT, VGA, USB, RS-232, etc. <br> 	Physical dimensions <br>o	Example: Handheld size (ex.2"x5"x5"), 1 RU x 12", 1 RU x server depth, etc.<br> 	Physical Configuration<br>o	Example:  Portable, rack mount enclosed unit, rack mount chassis, etc.<br> 	Physical weight<br>o	Example: <5 lbs, 10 to 30 lbs, <50 lbs, etc.<br> 	Power requirements<br>o	Example: 100-240 VAC, 9-32 VDC, etc. <br> 	Temperature requirements<br>o	Example: 0-50oC operational, 0-70oC non-operational, etc.<br><br>White Papers are the preferred submittal format for capability packages.

<p>The NIEHS is seeking capability statements from interested and qualified small businesses to provide a hosted commercial in-life data collection and management system to meet the specific needs of the National Toxicology Program.  The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is requesting information to determine the availability of interested small business sources to provide the aforementioned system, as outlined herein.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is one of 27 Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  The mission of the NIEHS is to reduce the burden of human illness and disability by understanding how the environment influences the development and progression of human disease.   The Division of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) is an interagency program whose mission is to evaluate agents of public health concern by developing and applying tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology. In carrying out its mission, the NTP studies the effects of environmental agents in laboratory studies, which are performed predominantly at contract laboratories and then reviewed by the NTP.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>System Capabilities and Support</strong></span></p>
<p>A suitable system should have the following potential capabilities:<br /> <br />1.	Access to a hosted commercial in-life data collection and management system for use by personnel of the NTP and contract laboratories carrying out NTP-directed research.  <br />2.	Provide user access across multiple locations<br />3.	Statistical tests, upload capability and usability requirements<br />4.	Capability to house additional NTP study types in the system<br /> <br /><em>1.  Access to a hosted commercial in-life data collection and management system for use by personnel of the NTP and contract laboratories carrying out NTP-directed research.</em></p>
<p>The system should have the ability to collect data from in-life studies, e.g. body weights from balances calibrated using the system, feed and water consumption using calibrated balances, clinical observations using the NTP glossary.  Data will also be collected in the necropsy room, e.g. organ weights from calibrated balances, gross observations and tissue/site linkage using the NTP glossary and validation rules.  For developmental toxicology studies fetal pathology observations using the NTP glossary must be collected, and for reproductive studies the system shall support pairing, mating, littering, pup and litter observations.  The system should also support histopathology observations using the NTP modified histopathology glossary.</p>
<p>The reproductive studies performed by the NTP and should be housed in the system cover 1 to 2 years in the laboratory, and include three litters per breeding pair generation, three generations (F0 breeder generation plus F1 and F2 generations) in the one study, and approximately 3,000 animals.</p>
<p>The developmental and acute toxicology modified one-generation studies are initiated with pregnant animals, and require that the F1 generation animals be transferred to up to 8 different cohorts within one study.</p>
<p>The system should function in compliance with Guidance from the Food and Drug Association (FDA) for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) as outlined in 21 CFR Part 11, with audit trails and security controls on data input and change.  Within this environment, the system should have the capability to support real-time access by up to six different laboratories in such a way that the data from one laboratory is not viewable or otherwise accessible by users from another laboratory, while all sets of data are available to NTP scientists.</p>
<p>The Contractor should have the capability to supply a help-desk staffed from 7AM to 11PM EST, seven days a week, and have the capability to provide annual refresher training for all users.</p>
<p><br /><em>2.  Provide user access across multiple locations</em></p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide accessibility to the system in user blocks of 25.  Contractor should have the ability to provide start up training for new users and provide assistance connecting laboratory instruments at any new sites to the system.</p>
<p><br /><em>3.  Statistical tests, upload capability, and usability requirements</em></p>
<p>The system should have the capability to support setting work schedule tasks by study day as well as by subject start date, mated date, birth date and study week.</p>
<p>The NTP collects estrous cyclicity data over 21 days on each animal, and plans to upload the data on a per-animal basis for the entire 21 days.  The system should support upload of retrospective data using a time by animals, an endpoint by animals, or a time by endpoint matrix entry screen.</p>
<p>The NTP control database housed within the system should have the ability to contain data on the incidence of histological, fetal pathology and other findings in control animals from all studies completed using the system, with dates of study start and termination, strain of animal, diet, route of administration and lab performing the study indicated in the database and available for filtering by the user.</p>
<p>The system should have the capability to construct tests for extended periods of estrus and diestrus based on a Markov chain model proposed by Girard and Sager (1987).</p>
<p>The NTP uses different mean calculations for summarizing litter data:  (a) mean of means for (e.g.) pup weights;  (b) mean of all in group ignoring litter (e.g. total dead pups for a group); (c) repeated measure (for an endpoint from litters a, b, c in RACB protocol) - mixed effects ANOVA across generations; (d) developmental marker attainment, BW at birth - nested ANOVA by litter size (2 factors - dam and litters nested within dam); (e) covariate calculation of e.g. day of attainment of developmental markers using wean weight and/or litter size.</p>
<p>The system should have the capability to carry out statistical analyses for possible dose-related effects on survival:  Cox's method for testing two groups for equality and Tarone's life table test to identify dose-related trends.   The system shall use the Poly-k test (Bailer and Portier, 1988; Portier and Bailer, 1989; Piegorsch and Bailer, 1997) to assess neoplasm and non-neoplastic lesion prevalence.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Report Capabilities</span></p>
<p>The system should have the capability to produce the following reports:</p>
<p>Cross-generation report with two columns per group per endpoint.  The first shall be the value for that endpoint for a given sire or dam, the second shall be the summary value for the pups (male, female or both, as the endpoint suggests) from that dam or sire.  The NTP desires that this be extended to the three generations in the study during the contract.</p>
<p>Multi-litter report with the results of three or more litters in a generation plus a summary value for all the litters in a group combined.  Comparison of multiple groups in a study for any set of 4 to 12 groups.   This shall not be limited by generation or litter number.</p>
<p><br /> <em>4.  Capability to house additional NTP study types in the system</em><br /> <br />The NTP will use the system to perform studies in addition to reproductive and developmental     toxicology, including Immunotoxicology, Neurotoxicology, Carcinogenicity, Acute Toxicology. These should be housed within the same system to leverage the glossaries and historical data within the system.  In addition, the NTP plans to use the system for a cross-fostering study design.  In this design all the pups in a litter are moved to the cage of a foster dam, and the pups from the foster dam are moved to the cage of a third dam and so on until no pup in the foster group is housed with its birth mother.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Other Important Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will be from 01 June 2012 through 31 May 2022, with one (1) year for the base period, and nine (9) one (1) year Options.  The base period shall encompass the time for software installation, validation, and training.</p>
<p>Section 508 standards are applicable to this requirement.  When acquiring Electronic and Information Technology (EIT), the government is obligated to meet the accessibility standards at 36 CFR Part 1194 and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

The Government intends to award multiple competitive Blank Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for the procurement of Sign Language and Interpreter Services as identified in the attached statement of work, in accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, FAR Part 13.
 Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements. There is no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. All calls/orders must be acknowledged by the selected vendor in order to be retained on the BPA calling list. The Government will not be issuing a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) because this notice will result in BPAs. In addition, the Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice. Because the needs of NSWCDD are dynamic, NSWCDD will periodically solicit additional offers to add new vendors to the calling list.
 The government reserves the right remove vendors from the calling list who deliver products/services late or who provide consistently poor quality.  

Individual call numbers shall not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $150,000.  A BPA may be issued for a five-year period.  

It is anticipated that there will be two methods of payments. The government will utilize Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) in compliance with DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (MAR 2008), to electronically process vendor requests for payment for calls greater than $2,500. Please notice that payments will be made on a monthly basis via the Citibank MasterCard for calls less than $2,500.
  Therefore, in order to do business as a BPA vendor, companies must also be able to accept credit cards as a method of payment. The monthly invoices shall include an itemized list of all calls that have been delivered during that month. The applicable NAICS code is 541930. The principal place of performance is NSWCDD, Dahlgren, VA; however, travel to other NSWCDD sites may be required in support of this effort. 

It is requested that interested firms submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 5 pages in length, single spaced, single sided, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating eligibility and contracting methods to meet NSWCDDs requirements. 

SUBMISSION OF CAPABILITY PACKAGES: This documentation should address, at a minimum, the following: 

 Company profile to include current number of employees, DUNS number, Cage code and a statement regarding current small business status (indicate whether Section 8(a), HUBZone or small disabled veteran owned); location(s).

 One, single page, key resume that meets or exceeds the labor category requirements identified in the attached PWS to demonstration the breadth and depth of the companys personnel.
 Resume must clearly indicate the persons availability.

DoD is also going through an IT consolidation effort to save cost. Cloud computing has been explored by many DoD organizations, such as DISA CSD, Army, Navy, USAF, USMC, and USTRANSCOM, as an efficient and cost effective way to host GIG services. There is an urgent need to develop a coherent enterprise level DoD cloud computing technical framework, architecture, and implementation guidance supporting all cloud services for DoD to ensure the interoperability of DoD clouds (e.g., private and community). Technical framework and architecture here intends to provide technical solution architecture to solve the issue of "What is the recommended interoperable DoD architecture to design, develop, and deploy cloud services (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) from the DoD cloud service provider perspective". The technical guidance for cloud computing services at the enterprise level is critical to ensure the interoperability of cloud services and improve performance of cloud services. The guidance will cover how to build interoperable private cloud services from the DoD cloud service provider perspective. The interoperable resource pooling and data synchronization across clouds are basic capability required to support SaaS, Paas, and IaaS between cloud service providers. DoD Cloud Computing Strategy and Implementation Plan are business drivers for the enterprise level DoD cloud computing technical framework and architecture.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> </span></p>

<DESC>SLAC seeks vendors that can provide the following:
<p>1 Each of CDMS Thin Film Deposition System Instalation with the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>(1) The deposition system shall be capable of handling 4 or more 100 mm diameter by 33.33 mm thick Ge crystal substrates each weighing 1.4 kg.</p>
<p>(2) Mechanical masking shall be provided to ensure that no film coatings occur on the side walls or reverse face of the crystal. The mechanical masking shall expose the front face of the crystal out to 1.6 mm from the outer edge of the substrate.</p>
<p>(3) The deposition system shall be capable of simultaneous deposition on the four (or more) substrates and shall be capable of making depositions on both the front-side and back-side of the substrates without breaking vacuum (i.e., deposition on the front-sides, flip the substrates, followed by deposition on the back-sides).</p>
<p>(4) A load-lock shall be provided for loading the Ge substrates. Initial pump down of the main chamber following substrate loading shall take less than 8 hours to reach a vacuum of 1&times;10-7 torr. Vendor shall specify type of high-vacuum pump to be used (turbo or cryo) and any associated throttle valves.</p>
<p>(5) The vacuum chamber base pressure shall be 5&times;10-8 torr or better after overnight pumping.</p>
<p>(6) The deposition system shall provide for sequential, DC magnetron sputtering with at least three targets (typically amorphous silicon, aluminum and tungsten) in a single deposition cycle, with the ability to apply a 0V to -200V DC bias to the substrates during deposition. Film thickness uniformity shall be better than &plusmn;3% across each substrate. Shutter(s) shall be provided to allow pre-sputtering of the targets. Vendor shall specify distance between target and substrate.</p>
<p>(7) The deposition system shall be capable of substrate cleaning immediately prior to film depositions. Either RF etch with ground plane protection for the backside faces or an ion mill system is acceptable. The etch rate uniformity shall be &plusmn;10% or better.</p>
<p>(8) The deposition system shall include at least two separate mass-flow-controllers with isolation valves and filters that will work with the following sputtering gases: Argon, Krypton and Nitrogen.</p>
<p>(9) A Residual Gas Analyzer (RGA) with a mass range up to 100 amu and the ability to monitor the main chamber during depositions shall be provided.</p>
<p>(10) All rotary-style pumps needed for operation and maintenance of the system (including RGA) shall be of oil-free design and operation.</p>
<p>(11) The deposition system shall include computer control capability to operate, monitor and record parameters throughout the full deposition process (after the substrates are loaded). The system shall also be fully operational in a manual mode.</p>
<p>(12) The deposition system shall be installed in room B04 of the Physics and Astrophysics Building on the Stanford University campus. The vendor shall verify that existing hallways and doorways provide sufficient clearance for delivery and installation of the deposition system and that the ceiling height (presently 100 inches) is sufficient for installation, operation and maintenance of the deposition system. The vendor shall maintain class 1000 clean-room protocol during installation.</p>
<p>(13) The vendor shall list resources and services required to operate and maintain the deposition system, including electrical and cooling requirements. House chilled water, warm water, single-phase 120 V, and three-phase 480 V &amp; 208 V are presently available in room B04. If additional services are required, vendor shall identify options for delivering the required services. Vendor shall specify the performance required of house chilled water in the absence of a chiller option and the cost of a vendor-supplied chiller option.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. VENDORS INTERESTED IN BEING CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE SHOULD IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS AN "INTERESTED PARTY" VIA THE FBO PORTAL. DO NOT CONTACT THE SUBCONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR.</p>

<DESC>This is a NOTICE of INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This will be an acquisition under authority of the test program for commercial items Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  Army Contracting Command- Aberdeen Proving Ground, Installation Contracting Division, 4118 Susquehanna Avenue, Aberdeen, MD 21005 has a requirement to procure (1) NDI ScanTRAK Laser Scanning System Model 2000, in support of Aberdeen Test Center, located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland 21005. <br><br>CLIN 0001<br>The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price sole source purchase order to Northern Digital Incorporated (NDI), 103 Randall Drive Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2V 1C5.  This proprietary system is the only one found to meet the requirements of enabling the laser measurement of body armor plates ESAPI and XSAPI plates.   <br><br>1:  NDI ScanTRAK Laser Scanning System with Multi-Sided Probe, Model 2000, QTY 1<br><br>NDI's laser scanning system uses a Perceptron V5 Laser Line Scanner which allows ATC to not only perform tests with a more accurate reading but at the speed required.  The NDI  laser also has the ability to add target sensors to an object after the initial set-up has been complete and does not limit the position of the handheld touch probe relative to the camera sensor.  This is a feature no other company provides and one that ATC needs to complete their mission.  Awarding to any other source would likely result in inaccurate test results and delays in fulfilling the requirement.  The associated North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334513 and the Business Size Standard of 500 employees.<br><br>All responses received within 10 days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interest persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than 3:00 PM Eastern Time, November  28, 2011.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.  <br><br>For questions concerning this Notice of Intent, contact Amy Bozzard, amy.m.bozzard.civ@mail.mil.  Posting data of this requirement is November  18, 2011.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED.  <br><br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division in support of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, is requesting concept papers from industry and academia to address the challenge of providing full-service living capability for small expeditionary forces with a suitable form factor and deployment complexity level. The Army seeks to overcome this problem through the development of a Self-sustaining Living Module (SLiM) capable of providing life support functions for approximately 20 Warfigthters. The SLiM is a research study that will explore the application and synergistic integration of emerging habitation technologies into a conceptual technology design and demonstration.  The SLiM's overarching goal is to maximize Warfighter quality of life and energy efficiency while minimizing logistics footprint with a futuristic concept that can be scaled for next generation military contingency bases.<br><br>This IS NOT a Request for Proposal.   The Government intends on awarding a minimum of one contract under topic D, Tentage, Fabric Structures, and Rigid Wall Shelters / Shelters and Life Support Technologies for Contingency Basing of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-13.  <br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>Current Army base camp systems, especially those of smaller size (less than company level), are usually composed of a variety of standard and non-standard equipment.  This results in inefficient power and water consumption, waste management, and construction while increasing operations and maintenance costs over time.  Additionally, these inefficiencies divert critical Warfighter efforts from mission operations to the supporting the functions of establishing, operating and maintaining base camps. Personnel are often forced to improvise when establishing base camps and combat outposts in austere environments - typically with little/no organic resources, no construction material handling equipment, often under enemy threat, at the detriment to their mission availability and effectiveness.<br><br>Army deployable shelters also require power and energy in order to meet the physical and operational needs of the Warfighter. The importance of having an unimpeded and renewable source of energy has become a crucial issue in the area of rapidly deployable shelter technologies. Power is currently supplied to fielded Army base camps through the use of heavy unit-driven generators and batteries. The characteristics of these power sources create high monetary and logistical costs. Their weight increases the burden to soldiers, causes greater fuel consumption and degrades the performance of Army transport vehicles. In addition, generators require the use of expensive fossil fuels.<br><br>The Army's contingency basing science and technology initiative strives to research, integrate, develop and mature next generation technologies for fully integrated holistic contingency basing capabilities. Specific areas of concern include: mission-specific plug and play components, subsystems and modules designed for optimized manpower requirements, increased survivability, optimized habitation, reduced logistics footprint, enhanced supportability, and reduced cost.<br><br>In support of the Army's contingency basing strategy, the S&T community seeks new, innovative approaches to address soldier sustainment and life support for future applications.<br><br>DESIRED CAPABILITIES AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:<br><br>The Army is seeking unique, forward-thinking ideas in order to develop a Self-sustaining Living Module (SLiM) addressing and resolving the issues described above. The development of the SLiM will advance the current state-of-the-art of applicable, expeditionary, life support technology. The SLiM concept focuses on novel, integrated system designs intended for future use, therefore, a complete list of specific performance requirements have not been provided as this time. Ideally, the SLiM will have the following capabilities/characteristics:<br><br> 	Provides shelter/billeting, hygiene (shower/latrine), limited food preparation, waste management or repurposing, and laundering  for around 20 personnel<br> 	Maintains habitable internal temperatures and living conditions<br> 	Automatic set-up and breakdown - minimize manpower, no MHE necessary<br> 	Interoperability with standard base camp utility structures<br> 	Capable of self-sustainment - can operate "off the grid", when necessary, through energy generation and the incorporation of energy efficient technology, including but not limited to: insulation, solar shading, automatic power shut-down, phase change materials, etc.<br> 	Expeditionary in nature (regardless of environmental conditions/water exposure) - compactable for shipment/transport, air-droppable or vehicle carried/towed, <br> 	Life support capabilities - water harvesting, storage, purification and reuse<br> 	Durability to operate in a variety of extreme environments and terrains<br> 	Protection against enemy threats (bullets, RPGs, mortars)<br> 	Protection against chemical and biological weapons<br> 	Fire-proof, or at a minimum flame retardant <br> 	In-field repairable - minimize the need for spare parts or special tools<br> 	Integrated lighting and power distribution<br> 	Upward Scalability (unit complexing)<br> 	Sufficient ventilation and condensation mitigation<br> 	Decontamination and cleansing capable<br> 	Real-time diagnostic monitoring of critical life-support equipment<br><br>As with all expeditionary Army systems, factors such as weight and cube should be considered and minimized. Additionally, Environment Protection Agency (EPA) regulations should be taken into consideration in the selection of materials and end of life disposal of the system. <br><br>SUBMISSION PROCESS:<br><br>All interested firms are encouraged to submit a Concept Paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-13, which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil. The BAA contains instructions for submission of Concept Papers. Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government.

<SOLNBR>EDCAPS-RFI-2011
<RESPDATE>121211
<CONTACT>Stephen Scheffer, Contract Specialist, Email Stephen.Scheffer@ed.gov - Gary L. Weaver, Contracting Officer, Phone (202)245-6138, Email Gary.Weaver@ed.gov
<DESC>RFI Purpose
<p>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) is issuing this request for information (RFI) as part of its market research efforts to identify potential sources with the technical capabilities in the area of design and deployment of "cloud" infrastructure. The objective of this RFI is to ascertain the level of capabilities and availability of potential vendors to provide infrastructure-as-a-service or platform-as-a-service for hosting the Department's mission critical financial management system: the Education Department's Central Automated Processing System (EDCAPS). Much like other federal agencies, the Department needs to continue providing effective information technology in support of the mission and work of the agency while facing the possibility of budget constraints and significantly fewer resources over the next few years. In anticipation of both an expected decrease in resources and the impending end of life for major elements of its existing EDCAPS infrastructure, the Department is assessing its options to transform its current environment into one that is more cost-effective, sustainable, and aligned with future business needs.</p>
<p>Important Note:<br />This is a request for information (RFI) only. This RFI is issued to support the Department's market research efforts and is solely for information and planning purposes. Any response to this RFI is purely voluntary and will be treated as information only. The Department assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred by any company responding to this RFI. The information provided may be used by the Department of Education in the development of its acquisition strategy and any related statement of work, statement of objectives, or performance specifications. If the Department decides to pursue a formal procurement action to obtain the services described herein, it will do so through the issuance of a formal request for proposal (RFP) or some similar formal document. Because this is an RFI requesting voluntary responses, companies that do not respond to this RFI will not be precluded from responding to any future formal RFP, if one is issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background<br />In order to gain greater control over and accountability for Department resources and meet a variety of legislative mandates, the Department developed EDCAPS, an integrated financial management system consisting of five (5) components: (1) Financial Management Support Software (FMSS), (2) G5 Grants Management System, (3) Contracts and Purchasing Support System (CPSS), (4) Travel Management System (TMS), and (5) Nortridge Loan System (NLS), each of which is described in further detail below.EDCAPS Systems</p>
<p>Figure 1 in the attached MS Word version provides a schematic of how the five (5) EDCAPS system are functionally integrated. <br /><br />The EDCAPS systems are linked through custom interfaces to provide the Department with real-time financial management capabilities that must be maintained regardless of where the systems reside. EDCAPS serves the entire Department of Education's approximately 4,200 internal users in various buildings located in Washington D.C., as well as 10 regional offices across the United States. EDCAPS also serves approximately 100,000 external users through G5. Because EDCAPS is a mission critical system, it must be available at least 99.99% of the time.</p>
<p>Financial Management Support System (FMSS)</p>
<p>FMSS is provided by Oracle Financials version 11.5.10 (11i). It is the Department's official general ledger and also includes functionality for budget planning and execution, funds control, receipt management, administrative payment management, internal and external reporting. The external reports include the financial statements mandated by the Chief Financial Officer's Act. The Department has also implemented the Hyperion Budget Planning module and is currently considering its options for upgrading to Oracle's version Release 12 of their federal financial management system.<br />Contracts and Purchasing Support System (CPSS)</p>
<p>CPSS supports the pre-award and post-award processes for all types of contracts, delivery orders, task orders, interagency agreements, small purchases and purchase card transactions. Requirements maybe consolidated at any level and multiple awards may be made from a single requirement. Awards are modified financially or administratively as necessary, until closed in CPSS. CPSS uses various means of posting and receiving procurement data and future enhancements will add web-based procurements. CPSS interfaces with FMSS, in real time, at the detail level, for funds check, commitments, and obligations. Batch files are exchanged for vendors, accounting codes, and purchase card payment files. Transactions includea combination of sub-procurement lines, multiple accounting lines and incremental funding. Data is stored to meet all Federal Government mandated reporting requirements such as the Federal Procurement Data System. The Department currently employs CACI, Inc.'s Comprizon.Suite as the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software package to provide CPSS functionalitybut has plans to replace the current CPSS system over the next several years.<br />G5</p>
<p>G5 supports the Department's management of more than 10,000 discretionary grants, amounting to approximately $2.1 billion per fiscal year, as well as Formula and Block grants totaling more than $15.2 billion each fiscal year. The Department also disburses approximately $28 billion annually in grants and loans to approximately 14,000 recipient institutions. G5 handles grant planning, pre-award, award management and post-award of the Department programs including discretionary, formula, fellowship, and block grants. G5 also interfaces with other program office systems, referred to as program feeder systems, to process obligation and payment data. The program feeder systems typically support the planning, scheduling, and award processes performed by the program offices to manage their programs (e.g., Campus-Based and Pell). G5 includes functionality for preparing and submitting grant applications electronically and interfaces with Grants.gov Find and Apply functionality for programs using standard forms. G5 allows peer reviewers to electronically review applications submitted electronically to the Department, in their homes or offices. It also allows them to record their evaluations and scores and submit the same to ED electronically. This system affords Department staff the capability to maintain quality control by monitoring the reviewers' progress during the review process. Grantees are able to prepare and submit their Annual Grant Performance Reports to the Department via the Internet. G5 controls payments for the Department's programs, including payments for grants and direct loans and other program-related obligations. It also serves as a subsidiary to the FMSS general ledger for program-related obligations, payments, and expenditures, and interfaces with FMSS at the summary level for funds control and general ledger postings. <br />In 2005, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated the Department of Education as a Grants Management Line of Business (GMLoB) Consortia Lead. In this role, the Department provides structure, leadership and governance support for the development and on-going maintenance of the Department Consortia solution, G5. G5 is available to other Federal Government Agencies as a shared-service, end-to-end grants management solution. Current plans include transitioning G5 to a fully enabled Federal cloud computing solution consistent with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) definition for cloud computing. It is anticipated that future enhancements to the current G5 provisioning capabilities will be needed to fully meet this objective. <br />The G5 system was custom developed for the Department using WebSphere Portal and Process Servers, Java, and Oracle. COGNOS is used for reporting. The final phase of G5 was recently put into production. The Department expects the G5 system to stabilize over the next six (6) to twelve (12) months.<br />Nortridge Loan System (NLS)</p>
<p>The Nortridge Loan System (NLS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf loan-servicing financial package that accommodates the Department's specialized needs for the following:<br />&bull; Promissory note functionality (Administrative Receivables)<br />&bull; Escrow functionality (Administrative Receivables)<br />&bull; Summary level recording of the Department's four Facility Loans Programs: the College Housing Loan program, the College Housing Academic Facilities Loan program, the Facilities Loan Program, and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities program.</p>
<p>Functionality includes receivable, collection and reporting activities, and financial transaction capabilities. NLS serves as an external subsidiary ledger to the FMSS general ledger for these activities. An electronic interface exists between NLS and the FMSS that provides for the transfer of general ledger level data from NLS to the FMSS on a daily basis. <br />Travel Management System (TMS):</p>
<p>The Department's Travel Management System (TMS), E2 Solutions, is a solution provided by Carlson Wagonlit Government Travel that is hosted outside of the Department as part of GSA's government wide eTravel initiative. It provides an end-to-end process including an integrated on-line booking engine, travel authorization, and vouchering process. The system is currently in a steady state lifecycle through November 2013.</p>
<p><br />Current Operating Environment</p>
<p>The Department's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is responsible for all design, development, testing, installation, operations, and maintenance of EDCAPS. The system is accessed via the Department's network, which is owned, operated, and maintained by Dell. These essential network services will continue to be provided by Dell. The current EDCAPS infrastructure is located in Dell's Plano Texas Data Center and Dell is responsible for its maintenance.<br />The current technical architecture is a multi-tiered and tightly integrated system utilizing clustered IBM pSeries hardware and high-speed archival devices. The IBM AIX systems and Oracle 10g are optimized for user requirements and are aligned with the technology strategy of Oracle and the Department's Enterprise Architecture (EA): Future State Vision and Transition Strategy. In particular, the IBM architecture is being optimized to provide the best value in terms of scalability, reliability, manageability, performance, and cost. <br />System Hardware and Software</p>

<SUBJECT>System F6 Demonstration Satellite Bus - Request for Information (RFI)
<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-12-16
<RESPDATE>010612
<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Contracting Officer, Email christopher.glista@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA's System F6 program will culminate in a 2015 on-orbit demonstration. The demonstration is presently envisioned to consist of four spacecraft--or fractionated modules--flying in a cluster. Each of the spacecraft is equipped with an F6 Technology Package (F6TP), 1 connected to a wireless inter-module cross-link transceiver, and running a protocol stack in accordance with the F6 Developer's Kit (FDK) 2 standard. Additionally, each spacecraft carries one or more payloads which the F6 architectures allows to be treated as shared network resources by the entire cluster. These payloads may be computing or data storage devices, additional communications transceivers, or navigation or mission sensors.
<p>DARPA does not anticipate funding any bus development efforts as part of the System F6 program. Instead, DARPA is ultimately looking to procure mature, low-cost, small satellite buses on which to host the F6 demonstration hardware. This Request for Information (RFI) is aimed at enhancing DARPA's understanding of existing or anticipated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-available small satellite buses. DARPA is also interested in mature buses that may be in a halted stage of development. Also of interest are funded spacecraft that will be flown in orbits that could serve as a host for a F6TP and connected experimental payloads. Such a spacecraft would ultimately need to be able to become one of the modules in an F6 demo cluster.</p>
<p>Please see the attached RFI for additional details.</p>

<p><br />SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>Description of Contract</p>
<p>This will be a fixed price&nbsp;Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery Contract in accordance with FAR 52.216-2 Economic Price Adjustment-Standard Supplies for a base period 3 option periods to supply Pink Boll Worm Paper Delta Traps (PBWPDT) In accordance with Specifications and FAR 52.209-4 First Article Approval-Government Testing.</p>
<p><br />Background:</p>
<p><br />The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) requires the purchase of Pink Boll Worm Paper Delta Traps (PBWPDT)</p>
<p>The PBWPDT is utilized in monitoring of the Pink Boll Worm (Pectinophora gossypiella) a highly destructive insect of cotton. The goal of APHIS-PPQ is to define the extent of these infestations or potential infestations and limit artificial spread beyond the infested area through quarantine and an active regulatory and treatment program. These programs are an effective Federal-State-International partnership that prevents the establishment of Pink Boll Worm in new areas. In order to carry out this program's objective, PPQ requires Paper Delta Traps to conduct insect presence surveys to support decision-making for program activities. <br /><br />Objective:</p>
<p><br />The Pink Boll Worm program utilizes this PBWPDT in conjunction with specific pheromones to effectively monitor populations. Without the requested traps, effectively defining infestations might not be possible and the ultimate cost of an eradication or control project could exceed millions of dollars should this trap not be available.</p>
<p>Specifications Material:</p>
<p><br />The traps shall be fabricated of hard sized, liquid packaging grade &frac12; gallon milk carton paperboard stock with 0.024 inch nominal thickness and polyethylene plastic-coating on both sides. Variance from nominal thickness no greater than +0.002" will be tolerable. The coating is typically 0.0062" outside (=9lbs. per 3,000 sq. ft.) and 0.0012" inside. It is essential that the traps described herein are capable of withstanding outside service for a period of 90 days. Paperboard (milk carton grade) must exhibit good liquid holdout capability, especially where edges and cuts are exposed. The drainage holes need to be completely punched out. This is measured by a "paperboard test" which tests the sample paperboard against an international paperboard standard. The industry standard range of weight for water absorption should be 1.5%-2%, and the percent of water absorbed in the sample paperboard should be equal to or less than the industry standard or not greater than 10% of the standard.<br />The Delta Trap design is required in one color: orange outside and white inside.</p>
<p><br />Fabrication:</p>
<p><br />The size, cutting, perforating, and precreasing shall be in accordance with the enclosed blueprint (attachment 1 and 2). Should the precreasing be directional, it should be done in such a manner that will assist in folding the traps into assembly. Precreasing shall be done in a manner that does not cut or otherwise damage the plastic coating.</p>
<p><br />Colors and Printing:</p>
<p><br />Traps shall be orange on the outside (non-sticky coated) and white on the inside (sticky coated). The process used to color the trap surfaces shall be resistant to fading and withstand exposure to sunlight for a period of 90 days without appreciable loss of color. A grid of one inch squares shall be printed in black on the interior surfaces. The width of the grid lines shall be approximately 1/64th of an inch and shall not fall outside of 1/58th inches to 1/71th inches. All printing shall be waterproof and unaffected by the adhesive coating, and interior printing visible through the adhesive coating.</p>
<p>The outer side panels shall be imprinted with black letters printed as follows:<br />SIDE 1<br />PINK BOLLWORM TRAP (30PT) TRAP# (18pt)<br />PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB TRAP (18pt)</p>
<p>PROHIBIDO TOCAR, MOVER, DESTRUIR LA TRAMPA (18pt)</p>
<p>FOR INFORMATION CONTACT THE COUNTY OR STATE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (12pt)</p>
<p>SIDE 2<br />COUNTY (12pt)</p>
<p>TRS (30pt) ACRES________(2" length, 18pt)</p>
<p>DATE (18pt)</p>
<p>NOTE:<br />Not to scale, trap dimensions are on schematic of the entire trap. Indent printing &frac14; inch from left edge and start &frac12; inch below first fold. Printing inside parentheses is informational only, do not print.</p>
<p>Adhesive:</p>
<p><br />Field trials have been conducted by PPQ personnel to test various adhesives for use on paper delta traps. It has been determined, as a result of the tests, the only adhesive acceptable for use is:</p>
<p>"Stickem Special"</p>
<p>Seabright Enterprises, LTD<br />4026 Harlan Street <br />Emeryville, CA 94608</p>
<p>Adhesive application:</p>
<p>A uniform coating of insect adhesive shall be applied to the three inside surfaces identified on the enclosed drawing (attachment 2). The amount of adhesive to be applied is eight point five (8.5) grams +/- one (1) gram. The adhesive shall be applied in a manner which prevents deposition outside of the designated area as shown in the attached diagram.</p>
<p>Following application of the adhesive, each trap shall be prepared for storage by storing adhesive sides together or placing a releasable paper over the required adhesive. The alignment of the paper or adhesion to another trap must not alter the non-adhesive surfaces.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause)</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p align="left">(b) The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the</p>
<p align="left">textile component source and send them for testing to the</p>
<p align="left">Laboratory cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be</p>
<p align="left">determined through the testing of these samples). In addition,</p>
<p align="left">the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of</p>

The period of performance will be December 15, 2011 to December 14, 2012.

The rationale for this Brand Name requirement is that the Stat software is the only change management solution that is certified on Peoplesoft AppConnect version 8.4, which is already installed at the IRS.  The STAT software is used in conjunction with the IRS PeopleSoft based e-Services applications.  E-Services is a suite of web-based products that allows tax professionals and payers to conduct business with the IRS electronically. These services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via the internet. E-Services is not available to the general public. Only approved IRS business partners are eligible to participate in e-Services.

Stat is a change management and version control solution that is designed to expedite the application implementation and upgrade process in Peoplesoft environments. By decreasing development timeframes, Stat allows organizations to take advantage of new application functionality more quickly.  When Peoplesoft introduces new features and enhancements to their applications, Stat helps users keep up to date with those changes and customizations. Stat eliminates the need to manually manage upgrades by automating development, migration and documentation of changes to the application.

This Stat software maintenance renewal is required to receive security patches and upgrades.  Additionally, the renewal will provide access to technical support.

The following FAR provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-54 are applicable to this solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with their quotation, 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order - Commercial Items,  the following clauses cited in 52.212-5 are also applicable:

All responsible sources that can provide the brand name requirement described above shall submit a written quotation (containing their DUNS number) no later than 2:00pm EST on November 25, 2011.

<p>Period of Performance: 12/05/2011 - 04/05/2012</p>
<p>CLIN #0001; Validation of a Model Year 2009 or Later Baseline Honda Accord CAE Model.<br />Item Description: <br />Validate a 2009 or later baseline Honda Accord model for NCAP and IIHS test conditions and compare requested simulations to existing test results using LS-DYNA software program or equal.</p>

<p>Fixed Price per Crash Simulation &nbsp; tiny_mce_marker_______ X 55 each = $ __________;</p>
<p><br />(vi)Description of requirements for the items to be acquired.</p>
<p>C.1 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) mission is to administer the provisions of the Highway Safety Act of 1966 and to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce economic costs due to road traffic crashes, through education, research, safety standards and enforcement activity.</p>
<p><br />Current vehicle design practices are to achieve good performance in the public safety tests conducted by the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). However, achieving good performance in these staged crash tests does not necessarily mean that the vehicle will perform well in vehicle-to-vehicle crashes, as these types of crashes represent a major part of real world crash scenarios. NHTSA wishes to study the net societal effect of the light weighted vehicle designs. In response to the safety concerns with vehicle light weighting, NHTSA had announced during the mass-size-safety workshop in February 2011 that it will use the light weighted vehicle design for a baseline Honda Accord Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) model which it is presently developing under a separate contract, as well as other studies to perform vehicle-to-vehicle crash simulations to study the effect of vehicle light weighting on vehicle-to-vehicle crashes and investigate safety counter measures for lighted weight designs.</p>
<p>Additionally, NHTSA is seeking to have a 2009 or later Baseline Honda Accord CAE mode validated and then perform finite element crash simulations using LS-DYNA Software. As NHTSA's light weighted vehicle design project progresses the agency is seeking firms that possess a Model Year 2009 or later Baseline Honda Accord CAE model to provide validation and crash simulation services in order to provide more comprehensive data and have a before and after light weighting comparison for vehicle performance in fleet crash simulation. Due to the accelerated performance schedule required under this project the firm will likely need to already have a completed 2009 or later Honda Accord CAE model in its possession, as all validations and crash simulations must be completed within the four (4) month period of performance of this contract, as outlined in the Milestones and Deliverables section listed herein.</p>
<p>C.2 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective is to supplement NHTSA's ongoing light weighted vehicle design project by contracting with a firm that possess a Model Year 2009 or later Baseline Honda Accord CAE model to provide validation and crash simulation services in order to provide more comprehensive data and develop a before and after light weighting comparison for vehicle performance in fleet crash simulations.</p>
<p>C.3 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>There are two major tasks required under this contract. Both of these tasks will be conducted using the LS-DYNA explicit finite element program.</p>
<p>1. Validate and verify a 2009 or later baseline Honda Accord model under NCAP and IIHS test conditions and correlate the model to existing test results; and</p>
<p>2. Run single and vehicle-to-vehicle crash simulations with validated model developed during the Task C.4.2 using the simulation matrix as shown in Figure 1.<br /><br />*** Click on Attachment to see the entire notice and solicitation&nbsp;***<br /><br />All proposals must be sent to the attention of Vincent Lynch at the followitn email address:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:vincent.lynch@dot.gov">vincent.lynch@dot.gov</a> and/or nhtsaoam.dot.gov. <br /><br />Questions Cut Off Date:&nbsp; Contact Vincent Lynch in writing by 3p.m. on Monday, November 21, 2011.</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)<br />1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79.

The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies.<br />(3) Full coverage in accordance with the State Worker's Compensation law; and <br />(4) Full coverage in accordance with the United States Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />(b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a certificate or certificates executed by an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates. Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each certificate shall state that (To be competed at time of award) has insured (To be competed at time of award) awarded contract number (To be competed at time of award) for repair/alteration of NOAA Ship HENRY BIGELOW in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance Requirements clause contained herein.

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and (FAR) Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, Content Extraction and Visualization, is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-54 and DFARS Change Notice DPN 20111102. The associated North American Industry classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and small business size standard is 500 employees. This is a small business set-aside.
<p>Program Background</p>
<p>ONR35 is in the early stages of implementing a Knowledge Management Portal using Sharepoint 2007 software. The portal is used to store, display, and retrieve technical and programmatic content to: (1) respond to internal/external requests for historical and current program information, (2) provide leadership visibility over programs; (3) provide document library storage of technical and programmatic content; and (4) facilitate business processes with electronic workflow capabilities. The department has had some success creating a department profile of programs; however, the current challenge is the difficulty/inability to easily extract, assimilate, display, and present data and associated content for briefs, point papers, executive information systems, etc. This severely limits the utility and adoption of the Sharepoint portal because without the capability to easily extract and re-use information, it doesn't save time or make the users' jobs easier or more efficient.</p>
<p>This six month effort will fund a proof-of-concept project, using ONR35 data stored in Sharepoint to show how content can be extracted, exported, and displayed in various formats (3-D, dashboards, simulations) in both hard copy and electronic formats. The software must be able to integrate or export from Sharepoint 2007 within a Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) environment in a semi-automatic fashion (not manually performed).</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is providing the largest amount of resources for a single disease in history, and seeks to expand prevention, treatment and care to millions of HIV-affected people worldwide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over the past eight years, it employed a multifaceted approach to combating HIV/AIDS in more than 100 countries around the world. The first five year goals were to treat 2 million HIV-infected individuals, prevent 7 million new infections and provide care and support for 10 million HIV-infected and affected individuals and orphans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In July 2008, the President of the United States signed into law a bill which re-authorized PEPFAR for five more years (2009-2013), increasing the commitment to $39 billion for PEPFAR HIV/AIDS programs and U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and UNAIDS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The new 10-year goals are: treatment for at least 3 million people; prevention of 12 million new infections; and care for 12 million people, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To meet these goals, PEPFAR plans are to support training of at least 140,000 new health care workers in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Global AIDS Coordinator based in Washington, reports directly to the Secretary of State and oversees and directs all U.S. Government (USG) international HIV/AIDS activities in all departments and all agencies of the U.S. federal government. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) also coordinates with non-USG stakeholders host-country governments and multi-lateral institutions such as the World Bank, World Health Organization, Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS),- in order to strengthen the coordinated global effort to fight the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In Guyana, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID/Guyana) is an integral partner in the PEPFAR initiative and plays a key role in the joint USG, Government of Guyana, NGO, and other national and international efforts to combat HIV/AIDS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In partnership with the Guyana Ministry of Health (MOH), the USAID PEPFAR program currently focuses on prevention, treatment, care and support in order to strengthen public health systems, and enhance the government, civil society and private sector responses to HIV and AIDS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Principal activities focus on reducing HIV transmission, mitigating the impact of HIV-related illness and strengthening the health system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Present program priorities to reduce HIV transmission include:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>prevention programming that ensures safe motherhood, targeted approaches for most-at-risk populations, and promotes counseling and testing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Comprehensive care and support programs focus on improving the quality of life of persons living with HIV and their family members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, USAID activities designed to strengthen the overall health system include developing health information systems and promoting data use for decision making, improving health commodity management systems, and building health care worker capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS and other diseases and conditions that impact the health of Guyanese.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The PEPFAR program in Guyana is going through a critical stage insofar as after years of substantial and growing support, the program's 2012 budget has been slashed and all USG agencies will be required to strategically cut back on the support they provide. USAID, the major recipient of funding and managing the largest portfolio of activities, will have to take a leadership role in reshaping the entire program. Another change involves the guidance from OGAC that country programs need to move to a strategy of sustainability in the near future as the resources decline. Because Global Health Initiative (GHI) funds are not available to Guyana, the budget cuts place even more pressure on the country to adopt the policy framework to take aboard the substantial programming of HIV/AIDS activities that accrued since 2003. This financial burden is a significant national budget issue for Guyana and will require close coordination with the Ministry of Finance. Finally, the USAID Personal Service Contractor will be the most senior USAID official in-country to manage this very complex and difficult process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">USAID, in its support to these programs, has entered into eight (8) separate agreements (contracts and grants) with NGOs, universities, private contractors and international organizations requiring extensive knowledge about contracting to support the achievement of its goals. These agreements are:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">1)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contract to implement the Guyana HIV/AIDS Reduction and Prevention Project (GHARP II), an approximate US$ 8M project, focused on providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Health and civil society partners in the delivery and implementation of HIV prevention, care and support programs. Under this contract, Management Sciences for Health is the Prime Partner, and Howard Delafield International and AIDS Health Care Foundation are sub-partners. This contract ends in December 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There may be a follow-up project to this activity depending upon the availability of FY 2012 funds which would require the USPSC to develop a Request For Applicaion and oversee the entire procurement process, in close coordination with the Regional Contracting Office in USAID/Dominican Republic...</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">2) Contract for Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) project, an approximately US$ 2 million annual activity, to undertake procurement, warehousing, information systems and distribution of critical HIV/AIDS treatment and clinical management commodities. This contract ends in September 2013 but will likely continue depending on the availability of funding. 3)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Agreement with Measure Evaluation for strategic information support for capacity building at the Ministry of Health (MOH) which totals approximately US$ 400,000 annually, and ends September 30, 2012. 4)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A contract to implement a one-year safe injection project, valuing US$ 300,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This contract commenced September 7, 2011 and will end on September 6, 2012.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">5) A grant with UNICEF supports the Childcare and Protection Agency of the Ministry of Human Services to develop safety nets for the protection of all children, including orphans and vulnerable children, through the establishment of legislation, a foster care program, and a legal aid system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This grant valued at $350, 000<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>will end on January 13, 2012.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">6)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A grant with the Pan American Health Organization (approximately US$ 400,000) supports Health Systems Strengthening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Project implementation is expected to commence September 2012. 7) A contract with a local Guyanese organization at approximately US$ 2 million annually, which provides financial and administrative management support to 14 local non-governmental organizations, which provide prevention, care and support services for persons infected and affected by HIV/AIDS at the community level..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The end date of this contract is January 2013.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">8) A contract with John Hopkins University to implement a US$ 200, 000 (annually) cervical cancer screening and treatment program to HIV positive women and high risk groups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This contract ends September, 2012.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">9) A new contract is espected to be started in the next two months called Powering Health in Guyana which is designed to improve health facility infrastructure and reduce energy costs. It will continue for at least one year.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">II.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE POSITION</strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The U.S. Personal Services Contractor (USPSC) Health Officer is responsible for the successful achievement of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>the U.S. Government's (USG) HIV/AIDS portfolio in Guyana. The USPSC's major responsibilities as the principal officer representing USAID in the health sector in Guyana are to serve as the Health Team Leader, and work closely with the Ministry of Health, NGOs, other national and international agencies, contractors and grantees, and other program partners to facilitate and monitor the final design and effective implementation of the portfolio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The USPSC Health Officer serves as a member of the USAID/Guyana staff and reports directly to the USAID/Guyana Acting Mission Director.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Following <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>closure of the USAID/Guyana Mission in September 2012, the USPSC will report to the USAID/Barbados and Eastern Caribbean Mission Director. Until that occurs, this position has direct supervisory responsibility for two Foreign Service National (FSN) employees. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Once the Guyana Mission closes, s/he will oversee one FSN technical employee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the health team leader, the USPSC is expected to be fully knowledgeable about <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>PEPFAR, GHI, Global Fund and USAID regulations and strategies, policies, reports, communications, and procedures .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The USPSC Health Officer will lead in coordinating the strategic restructuring of US Embassy activities as their funding is reduced and perhaps eventually eliminated and enter into a significant policy dialogue in conjunction with senior officials from USAID/Barbados and Eastern Caribbean and the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown to encourage the Government of Guyana to find space in its national budget to continue the essential HIV/AIDS activities being funded by a variety of USG agencies. The USPSC will be the lynchpin in development of the policy framework to be developed and negotiated and serve the key interlocutor between the USG and the Government of Guyana on Health Sector policy and the sustainability of HIV/AIDS programs and activities.. Among the other partners that the USPSC will be working with <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>are (but are not limited to) the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Finance, National AIDS Programme Secretariat, Health Sector Development Unit, UN agencies, the Global Fund and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>its Country Coordination Mechanism and Secretariat, other USG and bilateral and multilateral agencies, and national and international NGOs, community-based organizations and foundations.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The USPSC Health Officer will represent USAID in Government, Donor, NGO forums as required, and is also responsible for maintaining effective relations with designated program partners, as well as key stakeholders involved in health sector activities in Guyana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the USPSC Health Officer monitors and reports on the status of designated health sector activities nationwide, including via field visits, and attending/representing USG/USAID interests at workshops, conferences, the Health Sector Thematic Group, and other health sector coordinating committees. This will include giving speeches and writing speeches and talking points for others.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The USPSC Health Officer also acts as the primary point of contact for USAID activities under the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR), through collaboration with other US government agencies to jointly design, plan and implement all US-funded HIV/AIDS programs in Guyana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The two major USG agencies working in HIV/AIDS in Guyana are USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with active participation of the Peace Corps, Military Liaison Office of the Department of Defense, Department of Labor, and the State Department.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the integrated nature of the PEPFAR program, the USPSC will be in charge of ensuring effective interagency collaboration, and strong linkages with the Government of Guyana, civil society, the private sector, and other national and international bodies working on HIV/AIDS and related areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be essential for the USPSC Health Officer to demonstrate strong technical and management skills, complemented by outstanding negotiating, communication and interpersonal skills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Donor collaboration is a critical, vital function of this position.</p>

<DESC>REPAIR BRICK WALL AT COMMS <br />STA Oswego, NY
<p>Existing Conditions: <br />The masonry wall directly above the north facing communications room windows is leaking badly, allowing water into the building. A recent project replaced limited quantities of deteriorated masonry and mortar, and replaced rusting lintels as well. This particular area is the only location where water is leaking into the building.</p>
<p>The wall is constructed as a mechanically bonded wall (as opposed o a cavity wall.) Options to install extended flashings or a moisture barrier are limited. Therefore, re-pointing and sealing of entire area is proposed.</p>
<p>Site Visit: <br />Contractor shall visit the site before submitting bids. Interested parties shall make arrangements for a site visit with MK1 Jason Whitten, Engineering Petty Officer at Station Oswego at 315-343-1551.</p>
<p>Military Regulations: <br />The Contractor, his employees, and sub contractors shall become familiar with and obey all station regulations. All personnel employed on the project shall keep within the limits of the work and avenues of ingress and egress, and shall not enter any other areas outside the site of work unless required to do so in the performance of their duties. The Contractor's equipment shall be conspicuously marked for identification. There shall be no smoking in any Coast Guard building.</p>
<p>Work Hours: <br />Within the limits of current security requirements, the Contractor shall have unlimited access to the jobsite to perform the necessary repairs. Further requirements on worksite hours will be provided by the Engineering Petty Officer .</p>
<p>Temporary Utilities: <br />Temporary utilities (water and electricity) are available to the Contractor for the performance of this work.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:</p>
<p>General: Re-point all masonry between the top of communications room window and the sill of the second story window above. Replace all cracked brick in this same area.</p>
<p>Cut out loose or deteriorated mortar to the full depth of its deterioration. Cut out adjacent, existing mortar out to a depth of one quarter inch, minimum. Replace cracked brick with new matching units with full depth fresh mortar or grout.</p>
<p>Re-point entire area in successive layers with pointing mortar which includes a latex water repellent additive. Tool exposed joints slightly concave when the mortar is thumbprint hard. Use jointer slightly larger than the width of the joint so complete contact is made along the edges of the units, compressing and sealing the surface of the joint.</p>
<p>Clean area with proprietary masonry cleaner after mortar is thoroughly set and cured. Wet all wall surfaces with water prior to application of cleaner.</p>
<p>After cleaning, apply a clear, breathable water repellent sealer (such as a siloxane based compound) to exposed surfaces at the area of masonry repairs.</p>
<p><br />Cleanup of Work Areas: <br />The Contractor shall remove and properly dispose of all trash and debris incident to the contract work from the limits of government property, as well as all adjacent affected areas. Any surfaces that may have been stained or soiled by the contract work shall be restored to pre-construction condition.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Work: <br />Prior to acceptance of work by the Coast Guard, the contractor shall arrange through the Engineering Petty Officer an inspection of the work site to ensure proper completion, to identify necessary corrective work, and to ensure proper work area cleanup.</p>
<p>Performance Period: All work shall be completed within 21 days after award.<br /><br />Vendor should be listed in CCR: https//<a href="http://www.bpn.gov/ccr/">www.bpn.gov/ccr/</a>.&nbsp;</p>

If not, reason why not (growth work, contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Subcontracts<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or by e-mail. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by an e-mail or facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>HSAR 3052.223-70 REMOVAL OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES - APPLICABLE LICENSES AND PERMITS (JUN 2006)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have all licenses and permits required by Federal, state, and local laws to perform hazardous substance(s) removal or disposal services. If the Contractor does not currently possess these documents, it shall obtain all requisite licenses and permits within fifteen (15) days after date of award. The Contractor shall provide evidence of said documents to the Contracting Officer or designated Government representative prior to commencement of work under the contract.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>REQUIRED INSURANCE</p>
<p>The Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure and maintain the following kinds of insurance with respect to performance under the contract. In accordance with HSAR 3052.228-70, Insurance (DEC 2003), the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with proof of insurance for the duration of the contract, including:<br />1. Ship Repairer's Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />2. Comprehensive General Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />3. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the United States' Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />4. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the State's Workmen's Compensation Law (or its equivalent) for all places of performance under this contract.<br />The insurance certificate must provide the name of the US Coast Guard vessel and the contract and/or solicitation number as specifically insured.</p>
<p>INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), MLCA Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor, the PBPL Availability Project Manager, and the NESU. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI PSC staff are deployed and supported expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time. The Program Operations Specialist position is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. To achieve this, OTI requires a Program Operations Specialist who has the capacity to work well within a team environment, provide necessary supervision of a team, and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html.<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS)
<SOLNBR>RFI-WNS-JTCTRS

<RESPDATE>120711
<CONTACT>Thomas D. Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, Phone (937) 255-2666, Fax (937) 656-7538, Email Thomas.Sharkey@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><strong>Request for Information and Sources Sought<br />Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System</strong> <br /><br />This is a request for information, issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources with the capability to accomplish the effort described herein. The ASC/WNS (Simulators Division) will be competing the Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) with deliveries beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2013. Our primary interface with industry will be the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (https://www.fbo.gov/) site. We anticipate releasing the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for industry comment in early calendar year (CY) 2012 and expect contract award in late 2012 or early 2013. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Tom Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, at 937-255-2666, email: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil.<br /><br />This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract based on responses to this RFI, but is in need of information on potential sources for a system in support of the Combat Air Forces' (CAF), Special Operations Commands' (SOCOM), and Air Force Special Operations Commands' (AFSOC) Tactical Air Control Party and Combat Controllers in performance of Terminal Control, Terminal Guidance, Close Air Support and Joint Fires operations. The potential exists for the future contract to also provide systems to support the Marine Corp ANGLICO's, US Army Forward Observers / Joint Fires Observers and various units throughout SOCOM. This RFI is intended to help the government formulate the acquisition strategy and schedule. <br /><br />JTC TRS is an OSD derived program designed to fulfill an immediate need for realistic training and mission rehearsal for Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC), Joint Fires Support, and Air Traffic Control in a simulated and controlled environment. The anticipated system(s) will be used to train basic procedures in the schoolhouse environment as well as mission rehearsal in large scale exercises. Mission rehearsal capabilities to practice, validate, and verify Joint Doctrine Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) are essential. This training capability provides direct support to Overseas Contingency and Combat Operations. Both manual real time control and automated simulation of airborne assets is required. Multiple configurations of the basic training system are anticipated which include a fixed version and a portable version suitable for forward deployment and/or ship board operations. The fixed-platform version will be configurable to suit student groups in a school house environment, team training and individual mission rehearsal. Instructor Operator Station(s), robust simulated threat environment, simulated natural environment, and Brief/Debrief Systems are all required subsystems. The military services are investing heavily in high fidelity, globally networked, combat mission simulations to provide training in virtual environments that approach live operations. All services are stressing interoperability as a basic requirement. By the time JTC TRS is expected to be fielded, many air-to-ground platforms will have simulators that are fully network interoperable. <br /><br />This requirement drives visual simulation requirements, geographically accurate visual databases, high fidelity representations of weapons systems that interact with JTACs, and high fidelity simulation of weapons effects. Each JTAC site will connect into the Distributed Mission Operations Network (DMON) as well as other service and joint networks. This will require the JTC TRS to comply with CAF DMO Interoperability Standards (described at http://www.dmodmt.com/) and follow the guidelines of CJCSI 6212.01C. An associate contract agreement with the DMON network provider and other simulator manufacturers will be required in support of distributed mission integration.<br /><br />The JTC TRS acquisition strategy was planned to be "build-to-print" based on a Production Representative Article (PRA); however, the PRA does not meet all of the requirements of the Government Performance Specification (PSpec). The Government intends to set aside a period of the contract period of performance for the development and test of an engineering development model before a Milestone C production decision is made.<br /><br />Detailed performance requirements can be found in the attached notional PSpec. Please note that this attachment may be updated. The Government anticipates scheduling both industry days and&nbsp;PRA demonstration days prior to RFP release. The USAF has a requirement for at least 55 systems to be delivered beginning in FY13 through FY19. The Government anticipates a contractor logistics support concept for the CAF. All systems will be housed in Government facilities. Government-contracted instructor/operators will support assets acquired for SOCOM/AFSOC under a separate contract. <br /><br />In response to this RFI, please provide the following information:<br /><br />1. A description of your company, including address, CAGE Code, DUNS and Point of Contact information and your intentions for competing for this award.<br /><br />2. A description of your company's experience in developing and deploying high fidelity training devices and simulations for combat training, including a description of your experience in networking simulators and working with interoperability mechanisms such as Distributed Interactive Simulation and High Level Architecture protocols<br /><br />3. A description of your capability to develop, produce, test, and support a training system that meets the basic requirements described in the attached draft Government PSpec. Include information about your software development, manufacturing and production capabilities (including any ISO, CMMI or other certifications that you have achieved), as well as any subcontractor/teaming relationships that might pertain to this effort.<br /><br />4. Provide an estimate of the length of time that your company would require to either complete the PRA development or provide your own solution that would meet the requirements of the PSpec. Address any risks that you foresee in completing the limited development using the PRA versus proposing your own solution.<br /><br />5. A description of your company's capabilities and experiences in the worldwide deployment and support of complex training systems. Assuming a contract award in the 1st quarter of CY13, how soon could your company deliver an operational trainer to a CONUS/OCONUS location, and how many systems per year can your company deploy?<br /><br />6. A description of your company's experience integrating disparate simulation software and hardware into an immersive mission training system with emulated equipment.<br /><br />7. Identification of the top five risks you foresee in executing an acquisition of this scope.<br /><br />8. Comments to the attached Government performance specification. The Government is especially interested in the technology challenges each offeror sees in the draft performance description, as well as any areas where the PSpec does not provide sufficient detail for any requirement that would allow a JTAC to complete a training activity or mission rehearsal. Your inputs will be evaluated to determine if changes are required to the performance spec.<br /><br />9. Any other relevant topics, concerns, and information that will help the Government in forming an acquisition strategy.<br /><br />10. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is expected to be 333319, with a size standard of 500 employees. Indicate whether you are a large or small business in relation to NAICS&nbsp;333319 and if small, your small business type (Small, SDB, etc.).<br /><br />Technical questions may be directed to Kenneth Millard, Program Manager at 937-255-4786, email: kenneth.millard@wpafb.af.mil. Contractual questions may be directed to Tom Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, at 937-255-2666, email: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil. Formal responses should be e-mailed (preferred), faxed or mailed to: ASC/WNSK (Attn: Tom Sharkey) 2300 D Street, Bldg 32 Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7249 e-mail: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil. FAX: (937) 656-7538.<br /><br />Responses are requested no later than close of business on 7 Dec 11. Given the need for a rapid response to this RFI, lengthy and elaborate presentation material and explanations are discouraged. Marketing materials are not a sufficient response to this RFI. Please limit responses to no more than 10 pages, excluding comments to the draft Government PSpec. A point of contact that can speak for the responding company should be identified to support further Government inquiries as well as explanations that might be needed with regard to the information provided. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.

Each C4ISR system designed their own unique hardware to meet its stated operational requirement / mission. Installation of these C4ISR systems into command and control vehicles has become difficult due to space restrictions. Multiple Processors, Displays, Input/output and communications devices and installations kits within a command vehicle have reached the saturation point. The Size, Weight, Power and overall Cost (SWAP-C) involved with duplication of computing hardware for all these C4ISR systems is a major concern. The m-FoCS hardware (referred to as Mission Command Common Computing Platform (MC3P) in prior presolicitation announcements) is a means to alleviate these concerns.<br><br>

<DESC>This corrected Sources Sought is issued for the purpose of providing a response date which was omitted on the General Information and to include all information which appears to have been omitted when released in the fed biz opps announcment.<br><br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division in support of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, is requesting concept papers from industry and academia to address the challenge of providing full-service living capability for small expeditionary forces with a suitable form factor and deployment complexity level. The Army seeks to overcome this problem through the development of a Self-sustaining Living Module (SLiM) capable of providing life support functions for approximately 20 Warfigthters. The SLiM is a research study that will explore the application and synergistic integration of emerging habitation technologies into a conceptual technology design and demonstration.  The SLiM's overarching goal is to maximize Warfighter quality of life and energy efficiency while minimizing logistics footprint with a futuristic concept that can be scaled for next generation military contingency bases.<br><br>This IS NOT a Request for Proposal.   The Government intends on awarding a minimum of one contract under topic D, Tentage, Fabric Structures, and Rigid Wall Shelters / Shelters and Life Support Technologies for Contingency Basing of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-13. <br> <br>BACKGROUND:<br><br>Current Army base camp systems, especially those of smaller size (less than company level), are usually composed of a variety of standard and non-standard equipment.  This results in inefficient power and water consumption, waste management, and construction while increasing operations and maintenance costs over time.  Additionally, these inefficiencies divert critical Warfighter efforts from mission operations to the supporting the functions of establishing, operating and maintaining base camps. Personnel are often forced to improvise when establishing base camps and combat outposts in austere environments - typically with little/no organic resources, no construction material handling equipment, often under enemy threat, at the detriment to their mission availability and effectiveness.<br><br>Army deployable shelters also require power and energy in order to meet the physical and operational needs of the Warfighter. The importance of having an unimpeded and renewable source of energy has become a crucial issue in the area of rapidly deployable shelter technologies. Power is currently supplied to fielded Army base camps through the use of heavy unit-driven generators and batteries. The characteristics of these power sources create high monetary and logistical costs. Their weight increases the burden to soldiers, causes greater fuel consumption and degrades the performance of Army transport vehicles. In addition, generators require the use of expensive fossil fuels.<br><br>The Army's contingency basing science and technology initiative strives to research, integrate, develop and mature next generation technologies for fully integrated holistic contingency basing capabilities. Specific areas of concern include: mission-specific plug and play components, subsystems and modules designed for optimized manpower requirements, increased survivability, optimized habitation, reduced logistics footprint, enhanced supportability, and reduced cost.<br><br>In support of the Army's contingency basing strategy, the S&T community seeks new, innovative approaches to address soldier sustainment and life support for future applications.<br><br>DESIRED CAPABILITIES AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:<br><br>The Army is seeking unique, forward-thinking ideas in order to develop a Self-sustaining Living Module (SLiM) addressing and resolving the issues described above. The development of the SLiM will advance the current state-of-the-art of applicable, expeditionary, life support technology. The SLiM concept focuses on novel, integrated system designs intended for future use, therefore, a complete list of specific performance requirements have not been provided as this time. Ideally, the SLiM will have the following capabilities/characteristics:<br><br> 	Provides shelter/billeting, hygiene (shower/latrine), limited food preparation, waste management or repurposing, and laundering  for around 20 personnel<br> 	Maintains habitable internal temperatures and living conditions<br> 	Automatic set-up and breakdown - minimize manpower, no MHE necessary<br> 	Interoperability with standard base camp utility structures<br> 	Capable of self-sustainment - can operate "off the grid", when necessary, through energy generation and the incorporation of energy efficient technology, including but not limited to: insulation, solar shading, automatic power shut-down, phase change materials, etc.<br> 	Expeditionary in nature (regardless of environmental conditions/water exposure) - compactable for shipment/transport, air-droppable or vehicle carried/towed, <br> 	Life support capabilities - water harvesting, storage, purification and reuse<br> 	Durability to operate in a variety of extreme environments and terrains<br> 	Protection against enemy threats (bullets, RPGs, mortars)<br> 	Protection against chemical and biological weapons<br> 	Fire-proof, or at a minimum flame retardant <br> 	In-field repairable - minimize the need for spare parts or special tools<br> 	Integrated lighting and power distribution<br> 	Upward Scalability (unit complexing)<br> 	Sufficient ventilation and condensation mitigation<br> 	Decontamination and cleansing capable<br> 	Real-time diagnostic monitoring of critical life-support equipment<br><br>As with all expeditionary Army systems, factors such as weight and cube should be considered and minimized. Additionally, Environment Protection Agency (EPA) regulations should be taken into consideration in the selection of materials and end of life disposal of the system. <br><br>SUBMISSION PROCESS:<br><br>All interested firms are encouraged to submit a Concept Paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-13, which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil.

<DESC>The&nbsp;U.S. Department of Education (ED) intends to award two contracts for the operation and further development of the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) for the National Center for Education and Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE) of the Institute of Education Sciences. ED expects that one contract will be for 75% of the total dollar value of the WWC work, and one contract will be for 25% of the total dollar value of the WWC work. The contract for 25% of the WWC work has been designated as a small business set-aside (SBSA). <br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: This request is being posted to obtain feedback from ALL interested vendors (both large and small) that will aid the U.S. Department of Education in creating a successful performance work statement for the What Works Clearinghouse development.&nbsp; ALL interested vendors are encouraged to respond.&nbsp; THIS IS NOT A Request for Proposal.<br /><br />
<p>The priority for both awards is to maintain the WWC core functions - that is, the WWC Evidence Standards and the Systematic Review Process - while expanding content, improving how research reviewed by the WWC is presented to different audiences, and maintaining and enhancing the WWC website, study databases, end-user products, and tools that facilitate effective and efficient use of WWC materials by key audiences. Key personnel will be expected to have the highest levels of content-area and methodological expertise to guide the vision and work of the WWC. Toward that end, all offerors will be encouraged to partner with key personnel at a variety of organizations to ensure content-area expertise across the WWC.</p>
<p>In this request for information (RFI), NCEE seeks feedback about how the small business set-aside portion (25%) can be best partitioned from the entire WWC requirement. Entire tasks, parts of tasks, or a combination of tasks contained in the attached draft statement of work are all acceptable ways of dividing this requirement. Recommendations for partitioning of the WWC work should take into account feasibility of managing and coordinating tasks among contractors as well as how the high quality of WWC content can be maintained and strengthened.<br /><br />In a narrative description of no more than 10 double-spaced pages, please provide recommendations about how to partition the WWC requirement into a SBSA contract for 25% of the work. Please include a justification for how the work can be divided in this way. <br /><br />Submit all responses electronically to LaChelle.Johnson@ed.gov.</p>

<DESC>1.  Background
The FAA is charged with maintaining the safest, most efficient airspace system in the world. The National Airspace System (NAS) consists of a complex collection of systems, procedures, facilities, aircraft, and people. The NAS and the technologies it uses are constantly evolving. With increasing demand for flights in limited airspace, the FAA is constantly working to balance demand and capacity by minimizing delays and congestion while maximizing volume. The Air Traffic Organization represents the Terminal, En Route, System Operations, and Technical Operations workforces that ensure safety and efficiency within the NAS. The Technical Operations workforce includes those charged with installation, testing, troubleshooting, repair, monitoring, and certification of systems and equipment used to maintain the NAS.  As Technical Operations hires new employees to ensure its facilities are safely staffed for the air traffic of tomorrow, the Office of Technical Operations Training Administration serves as a bridge to the future by providing technical training programs that meet requirements set by the operational service units.
2.  Introduction/Purpose
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) needs to expand its resource base of deliverers for training the Air Transportation System Specialists (ATSS). The goal is to improve the availability of this training to the specialists and in the long term reduce costs.
The FAA is looking for suitable vendors to provide delivery of training to our technical workforce in the areas of Non certifiable systems training and Foundational courses. The Non certifiable systems training cover the following areas: Fiber optics, HVAC, Boilers, Chillers, & building Environmental systems. Foundational courses cover the following systems: Radar Systems, Navigation Systems, Instrument Landing systems, Environmental system and Automation Systems.
The FAA has a need to explore the industries capabilities on furnishing training facilities and conduct training. The FAA needs to know where the provider would conduct the training, information regarding their training facility and their capacity for through put of students. The FAA wants to know the providers' delivery capability of offering more than one class per year.The FAA wants to find out what resources are available and the associated cost to conduct foundational courses and non certifiable national airspace systems training.  To conduct training for FAA Air Transportation System Specialists with FAA supplied courseware. The providers must have faculty/instructors with the required electrical/electronics expertise in support of the delivery of technical training courses.
The FAA will provide the courseware electronically, however the provider is encouraged to provide the capabilities of disseminating the training materials to the FAA students.
The FAA requires that the provider conduct the classes on a daily one shift basis, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, Monday through Friday.  Training is to be continuous during these days except for federally established holidays.  Local or state holidays must not interrupt the training period.  Normal hours must be from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. with  hour for lunch; or from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. with 1 hour for lunch.

<DESC>The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is tasked with identifying, arresting, and removing aliens who present a danger to national security or a risk to public safety through efficient enforcement and removal operations. This includes providing adequate and appropriate custody management to support removals, facilitate the processing of illegal aliens through the immigration courts, and enforcing their departure from the United States. As a result, ICE has a requirement to replace the current Service Processing Center (SPC) located in the San Antonio Area of Responsibility (AOR).
<p>ICE is conducting market research in accordance with FAR 10.002 procedures in order to determine a suitable location for the required detention services. ICE is surveying several of the counties in the San Antonio AOR as well as private industry to determine whom may be interested in partnering with ICE to support the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) mission. In order to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, ICE needs the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Description of proposed facility, to include brief history, age, style of construction, layout and dimensions of interior spaces, security levels, number of detention beds, size of grounds/campus.</p>
<p>&bull; Geographic location and census data (population, education level, community size designation-urban, suburban, rural, etc.)</p>
<p>&bull; Projected date of facility's availability.</p>
<p>&bull; Proposed staffing of facility (e.g., number, name of positions, whether county employees or contract employees). If contract staff, identify proposed vendor.</p>
<p>&bull; Proposed partners, if any.</p>
<p>&bull; Proximity to local health care services, to include hospitals, emergency rooms, surgery, medical, and mental-health services.</p>
<p>&bull; Proximity to local consulates, pro-bono legal services, non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</p>
<p>&bull; Proximity to airport(s) and description of various transportation routes (public and private).</p>
<p>&bull; Brief description of facilities-related modifications that may be required to serve ICE's proposed population (ICE utilizes the 2008 Performance Based National Detention Standards).</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of on-site medical care.</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of Service Provider transportation.</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of indoor and outdoor recreation space.</p>
<p>&bull; Pictures of exterior grounds/campus, building structure(s), facility interior spaces (if available).</p>
<p>&bull; Ball-park per diem range.</p>
<p>If interested in participating in this effort, please provide the following information in response to this market research survey no later than 5pm on November 30, 2011. Please note that this is not a formal Request for Proposal. Since this letter is for information and planning purposes, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to respondents.</p>

Yes, 82 now, but will include all additions/subtractions.
3.	 How many hours onsite weekly or monthly?

4.	What is the current level of ACR involvement (i.e., is this facility already ACR accredited or is the successful contractor responsible for helping develop ACR accreditation)?  We are not ACR Accredited.  We are planning on doing so within the next 1-2 years.  The contractor would have a big part in getting us there.  So , equipment would be done with ACR guidelines.  Currently, it is not.

5.	Can we get a list of radiologic equipment requiring calibration and annual compliance testing? (i.e. how many dental equipment, MRI, CT, ultrasound, diagnostic, etc.)? 1 MRI, 2 CT's (64 slice/16 slice), 3 general X-ray units, 2 fluro rooms, 4 US machines, 1 NM hybrid camera with 4 slice CT (non-diagnostic), 1 Cysto room, 2 C-Arms, 2 mini C-arms, 4 portable machines, 8 dental units, 3 hand held detectors, and any other new piece of x-ray equipment that would be purchased in the future.  

6.	1. Badges:  Please verify that the RFQ does not require the provision of the badges themselves, but only for the review of reports and audits. The badges would be provided by the vendor.  

7.	Under the "ROOM BODY PART" Section, an MRI unit is listed but MRI is not listed on the inventory list. Do you have MRI that you need tested?  If so, how many and what other information would we need to know regarding such? 

MRI test is required annually.  HP would provide Phantom for QC.  Annual acceptance testing required.  When ACR donethen annual ACR testing would be required.

<DESC>This notice is being cancelled however it is being reposted under number <br />N68335-12-R-0044.<br /><br />The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE) intends to procure depot level manufacture, repair and refurbishment of Aviation Armament Equipment (AAE), specifically the P-3C Wing Station and Weapons Bay Pylons for the Taiwan Navy (TN) and United States Navy (USN). This effort will provide for the depot level overhaul, repair refurbishment and Digital Stores Management System (DSMS) upgrade of Wing Station (WS) and Weapons Bay (WB) Pylons and the acquisition of wing spacers, BRU-15/A and BRU 12/A bomb racks and associated hardware necessary to configure up to 12 Taiwan P-3C aircraft plus spares. The USN requirement is for the upgrade and repair of Maverick Wing Pylon Assemblies currently in a Non-Ready for Issue (RFI) status. The P-3C DSMS is designed to replace existing armament system Kill Stores, Torpedo, Harpoon Aircraft Command Launch Control System (HACLCS) and Kill Stores System while providing growth capability to control MIL-STD-1760D Class II stores at 12 weapon stations (6 Wing Station, 6 Weapons Bay Stations). DSMS will provide the same weapon capability as currently provided in the legacy P-3C armament system with the exception of specific weapon capabilities not releasable to FMS operators. The US Navy did not incorporate the DSMS functionality into the P-3C AIP aircraft. The pylons do not have the MIL-STD-1760D capability and remain in the original Maverick configuration.
<p>It is anticipated that the contract will be fixed price, and the government intends to procure a minimum quantity of 8 DSMS Wing Station Pylon Assembly Ship-sets; 8 Heavy Weight Weapons Bay Pylon Assembly Ship-sets; 8 Light Weight Weapons Bay Pylon Assembly Ship-sets for the TN aircraft and 12 Maverick Wing Pylon Assemblies and 5 Wing Station Pylon Spacer Ship-sets for the USN to be purchased with the first Delivery Order. After successful completion of First Article Testing (FAT), the government plans to issue delivery orders over 4 years for up to 13 complete DSMS Maverick capable Wing Station Pylon Assembly Ship-sets, up to 13 complete Heavy Weight Weapons Bay Pylon Assembly Ship-sets, up to 13 complete Light Weight Weapons Bay Pylon Assembly Ship-sets, two (2) spare Wing Station Pylon Spacer Ship-sets, six (6) BRU-15/A Bomb Racks, six (6) BRU-12/A Bomb Racks for the TN aircraft and up to 94 Maverick Wing Pylon Assemblies and 5 complete spare Wing Station Pylon Spacer Ship-sets for the USN. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued as a total small business set-aside. The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil. Select Doing Business and then Open Solicitations. Look for amendments on the web page. Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors. THE SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED ON THE WEB ON OR ABOUT 23 November 2011. The Government will NOT accept electronic offers. The point of contact is Rayann Surel, phone (732) 323-4045, facsimile: (732) 323-7440, email: Rayann.Surel@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">For this Effort NAICS Code: 334515</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">334516, 334418, 334419, 334111, 335999, 334511 (For Teaming Purposes)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The four subsystems described are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as <br />JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br /><br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br /><br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies may provide government points of contact to corrobate information provided on each sub-system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. FUTURE CONCEPTS<br />The government is interested in any future concepts or projects, which your company is working that may relate to the NEWEG project.

<p>334516, 334418, 334419, 334111, 335999, 334511 (For Teaming Purposes)</p>
<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>
<p>(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.</p>
<p>3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):</p>
<p>a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz.</p>
<p>b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS.</p>
<p>c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.</p>
<p>d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).</p>
<p>The four subsystems described are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as <br />JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.</p>
<p>b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.</p>
<p>Companies may provide government points of contact to corrobate information provided on each sub-system.</p>
<p>4. FUTURE CONCEPTS<br />The government is interested in any future concepts or projects, which your company is working that may relate to the NEWEG project. Please submit a separate report (maximum of 10 pages) on any systems, ideas, concepts, etc., which your company is currently working, is considering working, or has completed recently that could potentially bring added capability to, or reduced the cost of, this project.</p>

<p>3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):</p>
<p>a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz.</p>
<p>b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS.</p>
<p>c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.</p>
<p>d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).</p>
<p>The four subsystems described are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as <br />JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.</p>
<p>b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.</p>
<p>Companies may provide government points of contact to corrobate information provided on each sub-system.</p>

<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>
<p>(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.</p>

In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>
<p>(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.</p>
<p>3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):</p>
<p>a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz.</p>
<p>b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS.</p>
<p>c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.</p>
<p>d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).</p>
<p>The four subsystems described are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as <br />JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.</p>
<p>b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.</p>

<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.</p>

<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>
<p>(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.</p>
<p>3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):</p>
<p>a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz.</p>
<p>b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS.</p>
<p>c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.</p>
<p>d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).</p>
<p>The four subsystems described are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as <br />JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.</p>
<p>b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.</p>
<p>Companies may provide government points of contact to corrobate information provided on each sub-system.</p>

<p>Sources Sought Synopsis<br /><br />Maintenance of NRC Codes</p>
<p>This is a sources sought synopsis, and is not a Request for Proposal. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors that exists and assess their capabilities to assist the NRC with project work described below. The NRC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI). For information on NRC OCOI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5, entitled "Organizational Conflicts of Interest" (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response to the market research questions below and submit the capability information as described below. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than November 25, 2011. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. Facsimile (301-492-3437) or email&nbsp; responses are acceptable to <a href="mailto:Carol.Greenwood@nrc.gov">Carol.Greenwood@nrc.gov</a>&nbsp;or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Carol Greenwood, Division of Contracts, Mailstop: TWB-01-B10M, Washington DC 20555-0001.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors and nuclear materials in the United States. The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) furthers the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing technical advice, technical tools and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and providing regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions made by the agency, and in addition prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues of current and new designs and technologies. RES develops its program with consideration of Commission direction and input from the program offices and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>In support of the above activities, RES has responsibility for the development, testing, assessment, maintenance, and user support of the NRC's thermal-hydraulic (T/H) computer codes. These codes include</p>
<p>&bull; TRACE (TRAC/RELAP Advanced Computational Engine) is NRC's flagship thermal-hydraulics analysis tool. It is a modernized thermal-hydraulics code designed to consolidate the capabilities of NRC's 4 legacy safety codes - TRAC-P, TRAC-B, RELAP, and RAMONA. It is able to analyze large/small break LOCAs and system transients in both PWRs and BWRs. The capability also exists to model thermal hydraulic phenomena in both 1-D and 3-D space. It also includes the ability to model 3-D kinetics through integration with the Purdue Advanced Reactor Core Simulator (PARCS) code.</p>
<p>&bull; PARCS (Purdue Advanced Reactor Core Simulator) is a computer code that solves the time-dependent two-group neutron diffusion equation in three-dimensional Cartesian geometry using nodal methods to obtain the transient neutron flux distribution. The code may be used in the analysis of reactivity-initiated accidents in light-water reactors where spatial effects may be important. It exists both as a stand-alone program and as a separate computational module coupled to other thermal-hydraulic codes. In this latter context, the source code for PARCS is tightly integrated with TRACE. PARCS may also be run in a coupled mode with RELAP5 using a looser coupling technology called the Generic Interface (GI).</p>
<p>&bull; RELAP5 (Reactor Excursion and Leak Analysis Program) is a one dimensional (1-D) best-estimate T/H code that is primarily used for small-break loss of coolant accidents (SBLOCAs) and other transients.</p>
<p>The NRC has transitioned from RELAP5 to TRACE &amp; PARCS as its primary thermal-hydraulic analysis tool. As such, RELAP5 code development activities are at a very low level, limited to bug fixes and porting features from RELAP5 into TRACE.</p>
<p>Additional responsibility of RES includes maintenance of a thermal-hydraulic data repository which contains the results of experiments, tests, and assessments used to demonstrate applicability of T/H codes to its intended uses. Activities here include converting raw data files into the NRC's Platform Independent Binary (PIB) format and adding new information to the database in a structured format.</p>
<p>The NRC makes the above codes available to approved domestic users via a User Support Group, and foreign users participating in the international Code Applications and Maintenance Program (CAMP). The use of the codes by these organizations provides calculations and assessments needed to validate and improve the codes. Semi-annual international conferences are conducted by the NRC to discuss code results and related issues. Training workshops at the beginner, intermediate, and advanced level are periodically performed to train internal and external users on the use of these codes.</p>
<p>Capability Sought</p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing support in the maintenance, development, assessment, and training of TRACE, RELAP5, and PARCS; maintenance of its reactor safety databank; and program management of the Thermal Hydraulic User Group and CAMP programs. Specific capabilities needed include the ability to efficiently resolve code bugs and modeling issues in TRACE, PARCS, and RELAP5; the ability to effectively train users at all levels in the development, use and application of TRACE, PARCS, and RELAP5; the ability to develop and apply new numerical methods and constitutive models/correlations for TRACE, RELAP5, and PARCS; the ability to perform code-to-data and code-to-code benchmarks and validation for TRACE, RELAP5, and PARCS; the ability to provide program management support for the CAMP program and domestic user group; and the ability to convert experimental data from its raw electronic format to the NRC's PIB format.</p>
<p>The organization would need to provide a very broad technical expertise, including:</p>
<p>a) extensive expertise in research and model development in thermal hydraulics and reactor safety analysis involving studies of two-phase flow, heat transfer, phase change, coolant channel dynamics, and various other phenomena related to reactor safety,<br />b) comprehensive knowledge and understanding of advanced two-phase fluid numerical methods and two-phase fluid model construction, <br />c) extensive knowledge in software engineering principles, quality assurance, and use of version control systems, <br />d) strong ability to program and debug software using modern programming languages (with an emphasis on Fortran 95 and 2003),<br />e) a detailed understanding of the code architectures for TRACE, RELAP5, and PARCS (in particular) as well as an awareness of modern two-phase fluid code architectures, in general,<br />f) extensive experience in the use of TRACE. RELAP5, and PARCS and proven ability to perform reactor transient analysis for a broad range of reactor transient types,<br />g) knowledge using the SNAP graphical user interface</p>
<p>RES will require highly qualified technical specialists with extensive expertise in the technical areas described.</p>
<p>The organization and its contractors must have extensive research experience with demonstrated knowledge of historical and current nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulic related systems code issues. The contractors should have in-depth knowledge in this technical area in order to independently identify and resolve issues. The contractor principle investigators should also be technically competent and credible to participate in technical discussion and questions during periodic ACRS reviews and presentations. The investigators must have appropriate levels of engineering education and experience commensurate with this level of research, and exhaustive knowledge of current and advanced BWR, PWR, high temperature, and small modular reactor system designs and issues.</p>
<p>Commercial organizations that are interested in supporting our technical assistance requirements please address the market research questions below and provide capability information on your staff's qualifications and your firm's corporate experiences and qualifications on similar contracts or efforts. <br /><br />Market Research Questions</p>
<p>1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number</p>

DoD is also going through an IT consolidation effort to save cost. Cloud computing has been explored by many DoD organizations, such as DISA CSD, Army, Navy, USAF, USMC, and USTRANSCOM, as an efficient and cost effective way to host GIG services. There is an urgent need to develop a coherent enterprise level DoD cloud computing technical framework, architecture, and implementation guidance supporting all cloud services for DoD to ensure the interoperability of DoD clouds (e.g., private and community). Technical framework and architecture here intends to provide technical solution architecture to solve the issue of "What is the recommended interoperable DoD architecture to design, develop, and deploy cloud services (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) from the DoD cloud service provider perspective". The technical guidance for cloud computing services at the enterprise level is critical to ensure the interoperability of cloud services and improve performance of cloud services. The guidance will cover how to build interoperable private cloud services from the DoD cloud service provider perspective. The interoperable resource pooling and data synchronization across clouds are basic capability required to support SaaS, Paas, and IaaS between cloud service providers. DoD Cloud Computing Strategy and Implementation Plan are business drivers for the enterprise level DoD cloud computing technical framework and architecture.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> </span></p>

<DESC>Purpose:  DISA's Global Information Grid (GIG) EWSE Branch (EE21) will host an Industry Day to establish a dialogue with interested potential vendors and to answer questions on the background of EWSE and upcoming technical issues requiring resolution. On Industry Day, DISA EWSE will open the session by sharing the EWSE process for resolving GIG technical issues and answer questions related to the objectives of the larger EWSE work effort.  DISA EWSE will also discuss the strategy for the task support requirements and the desire to understand the capabilities of small businesses in addition to those of larger companies.
<p>When:  The EWSE Industry Day will occur on Wednesday, 26 October 2011 from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm at MITRE-Annapolis Junction (Meade).  The address is 300 Sentinel Drive, Suite 600, Annapolis Junction, Maryland 20701 (http://mitre.org/about/locations/md_annapolis_junction.html). Parking (deck) is available adjacent to the facility. The available space can accommodate 50 seats so we request contractors limit company attendance to a single representative.  The first 50 respondents are guaranteed seats.  Additional requests will be placed on a wait-list.  Attendance is restricted to pre-registered applicants possessing photo identification on arrival.  This meeting is UNCLASSIFIED; no visit request is required.  The meeting will begin promptly at 9:00 am. We recommend that you plan to arrive not later than 8:30 am to accommodate for check-in delays.  If the attendee is a U.S. citizen, please provide the following information to EWSE_WG@DISA.MIL not later than 12:00 pm on Friday, 21 October:  full name, company name, e-mail address, contact phone number, and mailing address. If the attendees is a foreign national, you will need to provide your passport and the following contact information to the MITRE Security Office at least five business days prior to the meeting (by 12:00 pm Tuesday, 18 October): name, address, phone number, e-mail address, company they represent, company address, company phone number and company website. Please send your information to Ms. Jacquetta Burton via fax, 301-617-3370, or via secure email to jburton@mitre.org.</p>
<p>Background:  DISA EWSE intends to issue RFPs (Request for Proposal) in the first quarter of FY 2012 in support of the FY 2012 EWSE initiative.  In FY 2011, DISA EWSE issued four competitive task orders.  The average value of the task orders was $870,000; individual values depended largely upon the complexity of the technical task.  Each task is performed by a team with typical contractor staffing of 3 to 4 Full Time Equivalents.</p>
<p>DISA EWSE hosted the EWSE Working Group Meeting with DoD stakeholders on September 1, 2011 to review candidate topics for the FY 2012 EWSE issue cycle.  The DISA EWSE approach is based upon identifying solutions that require DoD, Intelligence and Industry community involvement and expertise to capture the best ideas and approaches.  Existing working groups and on-going initiatives within the communities are leveraged to the maximum degree possible when resolving technical issues.  DISA EWSE requires Industry experts to complement the Government participants on each task by providing subject matter engineering expertise to the core team tasked with refining, analyzing, and proposing solutions to the technical issues.  The task outputs are various technical products to include GIG Technical Profiles (GTP) and GIG technical architecture artifacts.</p>
<p>Current &amp; Future Status:  After the 2011 EWSE Working Group Meeting, candidate issues were consolidated and further refined.  The following topics are currently considered for competitive acquisition in FY 2012 and will be discussed at the Industry Day. Additionally, more details could follow as amendment to this RFI:</p>
<p>1.	GIG IPv6 Service and Network Architecture<br />DoD has worked IPv6 transition strategy and plan in the past and determined IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack model to be the baseline architecture for transitioning to IPv6. With most recent federal OMB and DoD IPv6 mandate and directives, there is an urgent and practical need to analyze the current IPv6 technical requirements and high-level transition plan, and develop detailed DoD IPv6 network architecture, engineering design and implementation guidance required for incremental implementation and transition across both strategic and tactical networks.  During the transition, IPv4 only, IPv6 only and dual stack network islands will co-exist within GIG and complex permutation of interconnection among those network types need to be analyzed and addressed. So detailed transition approach and implementation guidance based on industry best practice need to be developed.</p>
<p>The objectives of this task are to develop: 1) DoD GIG IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack incremental network architecture and Implementation guidance for near/mid/far-term; 2) GIG IPv6 inter-domain routing architecture and networking service solution architecture (DNS, HAIPE GDS etc.); 3) Technical framework and approach to GIG IPv6 network management and IA requirements; 4) GIG IPv6 transition techniques and implementation guidelines based on industry best practice.</p>
<p>2.	Service Level Interoperability for Tactical Edge and Core<br />The interoperability of services across different tactical edge &amp; core domains is an essential requirement to support joint missions.  For some infrastructure and core services (e.g. Service Discovery, Content Discovery, Collaboration) joint interoperability specifications/profiles are only partially complete, and those do not sufficiently address tactical edge technical constraints (e.g. DIL). As well, adoption by PORs of completed service interoperability specifications/profiles has been minimal.  Leveraging the products from previous EWSE IPTs (e.g. the Joint Tactical Edge Services Framework), EWSE will continue its efforts in FY12 to support development and use of the joint interoperability specifications/profiles.</p>
<p>The objectives of the Service Level Interoperability for the Tactical Edge &amp; Core (SLI-TEC) multi-year task will be to 1) complete development of the joint interoperability specifications/profiles for all infrastructure and core services in coordination with major programs and their existing service interface implementations, 2) provide support and guidance to related IPTs (e.g. Content Discovery &amp; Retrieval IPT), PORs, and PEOs in order to aid in the adoption of the specs/profiles, 3) continue to improve the Joint Tactical Edge Services Framework and support its incorporation within relevant COI Architectures (e.g. JC2 Objective Architecture), and, 4) to research alternative architectural models to improve the performance and enhance the capabilities needed to support joint interoperability (e.g. Semantic Service Bus, Tactical Edge Bus).</p>
<p>3.	GIG Cloud Computing Services Guidance<br />US CIO has issued a &lsquo;cloud first' policy in February 2011 to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of federal IT infrastructure and services. DoD is also going through an IT consolidation effort to save cost. Cloud computing has been explored by many DoD organizations, such as DISA CSD, Army, Navy, USAF, USMC, and USTRANSCOM, as an efficient and cost effective way to host GIG services. There is an urgent need to develop a coherent enterprise level DoD cloud computing technical framework, architecture, and implementation guidance supporting all cloud services for DoD to ensure the interoperability of DoD clouds (e.g., private and community). Technical framework and architecture here intends to provide technical solution architecture to solve the issue of "What is the recommended interoperable DoD architecture to design, develop, and deploy cloud services (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) from the DoD cloud service provider perspective". The technical guidance for cloud computing services at the enterprise level is critical to ensure the interoperability of cloud services and improve performance of cloud services. The guidance will cover how to build interoperable private cloud services from the DoD cloud service provider perspective. The interoperable resource pooling and data synchronization across clouds are basic capability required to support SaaS, Paas, and IaaS between cloud service providers. DoD Cloud Computing Strategy and Implementation Plan are business drivers for the enterprise level DoD cloud computing technical framework and architecture.</p>
<p>The objectives of this task are to develop:1) DoD Cloud computing technical framework including taxonomy of cloud computing terminologies based on NIST definitions tailored to DoD environment, use cases and requirements of functional capabilities to be provided by clouds, and DoD cloud service definition and criteria checklist to qualify for each type of DoD cloud service; 2) an overarching DoD cloud computing interoperability reference architecture to show how different clouds interface and interact with each other for resource pooling and data synchronization; 3) the near-term, mid-term, and long-term DoD cloud computing solution architectures for realizing the DoD cloud computing interoperability reference architecture to include design of system components of multiple layers (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS) from the cloud service provider perspective; 4) DoD cloud computing implementation guidance including minimum essential engineering guidance and design patterns for new cloud services development and legacy services migration to cloud services; 5) Initial GTP Input for GIG Cloud Computing Services Guidance including framework, architecture, and implementation guidance with key components in SysML (Requirements Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Activity Diagram, Block Definition Diagram); 6) DoD Cloud Services Management and security capabilities with key components in SysML (Optional);7) DoD Cloud Computing Architecture and Implementation Guidance for Tactical DIL Environment with key components in SysML (Optional).</p>
<p>4.	Dynamic Access Control Framework<br />DoD CIO identified the IdAM as the foundation for accessing future information services.  The need for a consistent real time dynamic access control capability for DoD is identified as one of the DoD top IT priorities.  Multiple IdAM frameworks exist within Federal government and DoD with fragmented lexicon and interface definition.  There is a need for a synchronized framework in order to facilitate the development and implementation of a DoD wide dynamic access control capability with possibility to be able to interface with each other in the future.  EWSE FY10 GIG Authentication and Access Control (GAAC) IPT started addressing the issue with a Dynamic Access Control Framework GTP/White Paper with recommended lexicon and ontology definition attempting to provide a platform to address the fragmented framework issue. The objective of this task is to leverage the GAAC work and further develop technical architecture and implementation guidance between the service provided by Enterprise and Community of Interest (COI) to facilitate such future program development of the dynamic access control capability.  <br />The outputs needed are 1) Attribute Service architecture and interoperability guidance between Enterprise (Enterprise Identity and Attribute Service a.k.a EIAS run by DMDC) and COI attribute service.  This architecture/guidance development will address the interoperability between EIAS and COI provided attribute services; 2) Access Control Policy Store/Service architecture and interoperability guidance between Enterprise and COI policy store/service.  This architecture/guidance development will address the distribution of and interoperability between the enterprise and COI distributed policy service ; 3) Metadata attribute schema and discovery architecture between all Enterprise and COI information; 4) Environmental Attribute Service architecture and interoperability guidance between Enterprise and COI Environmental attribute service; 5) Transitional plan/architecture from "as-is" to  "to-be" state on how to make the current COI Identity/Role Based Access Control (IBAC/RBAC) to an Enterprise-wide Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) ; 6) Non-Person Entity (NPE) related identity and access management reference architecture if the development in this area is mature enough to create a interoperability guidance during the course of the task.</p>
<p>In order to have a productive Industry Day, each company planning to attend should send a representative well versed on the above topics so that a meaningful dialogue can be conducted.  Part of the discussion will clarify the technical problem statement as well as define some of the constraints placed on the potential problem solutions.</p>
<p>DISA will not address contractual questions during this Industry Day.  The sole function of the meeting will be to provide industry a firm understanding of technical requirements, identify required expertise, and gain an understanding of the technical capabilities of the companies present.  The Government is particularly interested in identifying small businesses that are capable of doing this type of work.  For market research purposes, we request both large and small businesses provide the following company capability information NLT than 12:00 pm Friday, 21 October to EWSE_WG@DISA.MIL : 1) representative full name, 2) company name, 3) your NAICS codes and the associated business size standard, 4) e-mail address, 5) contact phone number, 6) capability statement limited to 10 pages organized by four technical topics described above in this section, 7) listing of contract numbers where you are the prime (e.g. GSA schedules, multiple award contracts, etc.).</p>

Each award will include one base year and four option years under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders (TO) will be negotiated. It is anticipated that one solicitation will be issued resulting multiple awards, with a target of three or more contracts; however, the Government reserves the right to award more, less or none at all if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541310, Architectural Services, with a small business size standard of $4.5M. The total requirements expected to be awarded under this PLANNING AND PROGRAMING A-E contract is anticipated to equal approximately $75,000,000 over a period of five (5) years.

It is anticipated that the first six months will be a pilot program covering 14 each CB-OTH MKIIIs located in Cape May, NJ (2 boats) and Portsmouth, Va (6 boats) and 6 spare boats in addition to 2 each CB-OTH MKII spares.&nbsp; Depending on the success of the pilot program, the number of boats is anticipated to increase incrementally.&nbsp; The pace at which the number of boats will be increased has yet to be determined and will be provided to the contractor when available.&nbsp; The contractor should expect an average of 7 boats in storage/maintenance at any time during the pilot period.&nbsp; If the pilot proves successful, the option years may be exercised and would likely expand the scope to include all East Coast CB-OTH MKIIIs (31) and spare CB-OTH MKIIs (2) and West Coast CBH-OTH MKIIIs (14) and spare CB-OTH MKIIs (3).&nbsp; The actual number of boats may vary slightly throughout the contract period.</p>
