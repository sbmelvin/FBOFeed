Public data release will occur at the end of the first two years and every two years thereafter.  NHANES will examine approximately 5,000 sample persons per year.  Specifications for the primary sampling units and sample design will be provided to the contractor.  The estimated period of performance will be ten years.
	
	The proposed Scope of Work contains two optional surveys and some optional interview and examination components.  The optional survey, Community HANES, will be a local survey where the sample is a small, defined population.  
	
	The contractor shall adapt from the existing software and hardware the system necessary to develop, maintain, and appropriately upgrade the totally automated and integrated data collection and quality control system to the specifications of NCHS.  The system must be able to adapt to survey content changes that may occur as the data collection continues.  All regulations and mandated hardware and software requirements will be specified in the RFP.

<DESC>The Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Tactical Data Links System Program Office (TDL SPO) is seeking sources to continue the iLinks development effort.  The TDL SPO intends to solicit sources with existing GSA Schedule contracts to meet the government's requirements.  iLinks is an integrated digital environment that allows TDL users security role based access to a host of TDL information.  The TDL SPO would like to leverage off what has been accomplished with iLinks to date as well as leveraging off other Internet programs at the center.  Specifically, ESC would like to apply technology, techniques and software already developed for Global Air Traffic Management Program Office (iGATM), the C2 Enterprise Portal (ESC/CX), the SMART system (ESC/AC) and the Enterprise Management Portal (EMP).  The objective of this program is to build on these tools and to continue applying Internet-type capabilities to AF requirements.   It should provide a basis for automating, standardizing, and coordinating processes within the TDL SPO while integrating with other ESC Program Offices.  It is intended to migrate and expand the results of the current iLinks website to include a classified Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) site.  The classified SIPRNET site and the Unclassified but Sensitive Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) site shall remain in synch with the exception of the classified material that cannot be displayed on the NIPRNET site.  It is also intended that the products of this development will consist of Commercial Off The Shelf software (COTS) whenever possible.  iLinks shall support, as a minimum a set of capabilities to include: Use of Web-enabled browser interface management to streamline access to TDL and platform Program Office information on a worldwide basis; efficient access to legacy information data stores; combine and manipulate data from multiple data sources and post results in configurable display formats, provide community of interest rule based participation, integrate all existing requirements from the requirements document attached while helping to define and integrate new requirements, and provide these capabilities in both the NIPRNET and SIPRNET domains.  The successful offeror will also assist in identifying, and enhancing all platform Program Offices' processes and business rules.  The recommendation will include an estimate of the magnitude of the requirements.  The offeror will build upon existing requirements to automate processes and business rules that have been developed during the first and second iterations of iLinks.   The web product needs to be interoperable with several other database applications throughout the DoD, it shall build upon the role based security already developed, there shall be a duplicate application on the SIPRNET, and the product shall be user friendly, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing.  The product needs to be built as an open architecture allowing data to be edited by users based on their security levels.  The software needs to be developed on an Oracle database.  The contract will be based on a spiral development schedule to incrementally enhance the functionality of the site.  The period of performance will a base period of eighteen (18) months with two (2) one year options.   Responses are due within thirty (30) days of the publication of this notice.  All interested sources should contact Mr. Jeffrey Wong by e-mail at Jeffrey.Wong@hanscom.af.mil . Be advised that all interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database in order to receive an award and hold current GSA Schedule contracts that offer services and supplies to meet the government's requirements.  If you are not registered in the CCR Database you may request an application at (888) 227-2423 or through the CCR website http://www.ccr.gov.

Topics to be included:  Analysis vs. design, what's the difference, Requirements and non-requirements, Essential requirements and design requirements, Defining analysis and design, What does it mean to be object oriented, Brief history of object-orientation, Comparing and contrasting structured and object-oriented, Software object-from concept to code, Defining object-orientation, Object-orientation meets analysis, Use-case diagrams, Class diagrams, Collaboration diagrams, Sequence diagrams, State diagrams, actions, and activities, Object-orientation meets design,  The transition to design, Designing interfaces, High-level software design, Low-level software design, Software optimization, What's next with the UML, This course should be tailored to address real time distributed Command and Control systems. Expected benefits of the course: attendees should gain an in-depth understanding of how to improve SIAP's (Single Integrated Air Picture) object-oriented requirements analysis and design and have an introduction to the UML.  Attendees should have the opportunity to practice techniques they can apply to SIAP efforts.  This will not be an award based on price, it will need to be based on the company and instructors relevance to and experience with SIAP.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this synopsis/solicitation is 541511 (Size Standard - $21 Million). Solicitation/Purchase Request number FUGPL930520100 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12, effective 24 January 2003.  The Government intends to solicit and award to ThermoAnalytics, Inc., of Calumet, Michigan, on a sole source basis.  One (1) contract line item for the addition of features to the ThermoAnalytics, Inc. Multi-Service Electro Optic Signature (MuSES) software suite, the Thermal Description File Input/Output Library (TDF I/O), and the MuSES Lite in support of the suite for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Weather Impact Decision Aids (WIDA) currently in development and operation.  These supplies and services have the following description. STATEMENT OF WORK: AFRL/VSBL requires that software features be added to ThermoAnalytics thermal/signature-solver software named MuSES.  TASKS: The following tasks will add features to MuSES, TDF I/O Library, and MuSES Lite to support the suite of AFRL/VSBL Weather Impact Decision Aids (WIDA) currently in development and operation.  TASK 1: Add a Patch Solver capability to MuSES to provide a Rapid Calculation Mode in WIDA software products such as Target Acquisition Weather Software (TAWS), Joint Environmental Exploration Segment (JEES), or Infrared Target Scene Simulation Software (IRTSS). This task will be accomplished through the following steps: (1) Eliminate lateral conduction (use existing patch generator so elements in the same patch have the same temperature).  (2) Add patch level access functions to the TDF I/O library.  (3) Deactivate calculation of extra node temperatures in each radiation patch so only one temperature is calculated for each patch. (4) Pre-compute apparent areas and store in a file for use in the thermal solution and when retrieving results with the TDF I/O library.  (5) Code Testing and Verification, Target Upgrades, TAWS Integration Support.  TASK 2: Provide Requested Software Revisions to MuSES Lite.  Initial target editing capability (re-scaling and re-painting) is included in MuSES Lite and associated function calls in the TDF I/O Library. The software was based on anticipated user requirements. As it is further exposed to the User Community, feedback is being generated resulting in new requirements and requested design changes to the Graphical User Interface. Additional changes are being requested for the associated Paint Databases for each target type.  TASK 3: The Contractor will modify three (3) MuSES IR target models for use in TAWS V3.1.2. Supporting documentation will be provided along with the target files. Support for testing and implementation and TAWS is required. The targets should have optimal runtime speed within TAWS. The targets will use unclassified input data and will be delivered through unclassified channels. The specified target models include the Roland II tank, the AAA Gun (KS-19, 100-mm), and the AAA Gun (S-60, 57-mm). The target files and support documentation will be delivered to the TAWS system integrator, NGIT, and to AFRL/VSBL.  DELIVERABLES/SCHEDULE: Deliverables will include all software product updates (including MuSES Pro, MuSES Lite, TDF I/O Library), target models, paint databases, briefing materials, and documentation developed under this contract per AFRL/VSBL specifications. The exact delivery date of each item will be coordinated with AFRL/VSBL. The period of performance is from contract award date through Sep 30, 2003.  The items must be delivered and services performed no later than 30 September 2003 to Hanscom AFB, MA 01731.

<DESC>Description: NAICS 236220 (previously 233320)  Size Standard: $28.5 Million. Project No. NMA00154, Solicitation No. GS-01P-03-NLC-0022 Building Extension at the Hastings-Keith Federal Building, New Bedford, MA. This procurement is restricted to certified HUB Zone small business concerns. The estimated construction cost range is $1 million to $5 million. The estimated period of performance is 12 months.  This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all management, labor, materials, and equipment necessary for completing a new masonry, one-story, building extension, at the existing Hastings-Keith Federal Building; originally completed in 1976.  The new addition will be tied into the existing building, which has a porcelain-enameled exterior panel system.  Construction portions will be phased to accommodate the tie-in of the new building to the existing building, which will remain occupied. The area of the new addition is approximately 6,000.00 SF.  The successful firm must have previous experience with size and scope of similar construction projects.  The contractor’s personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  Work includes, but is not limited to, site work removals, interior reconfiguration consisting of finishes, heating/cooling, lighting power and fire protection.  Construction work will include an IWS/LAN installation that will be completed in five phases in both existing spaces and the new addition.  The project is being procured using source selection procedures, which will result in a firm-fixed price award to the offeror who provides the best value to the Government. The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the proposal that represents the best value to the Government.  For this procurement, evaluation factors are equal to price related factors.  Upon receipt of all price and responses to evaluation factors, a formal selection of a firm will be made. Failure of offerors to submit a response to the evaluation factors will preclude further participation on this acquisition. Evaluation factors will consist of 1) prior experience, 2) management capability, 3) past performance. Regarding past performance offerors with no relevant performance history shall provide information which helps to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the requirement as identified in  the attached Statement of Work.  Offerors should provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.  The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance. The government’s evaluation will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. 
In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Interested parties may obtain a copy of the solicitation package, which will be available on CD only. The CD solicitation package should be available on or about March 28, 2003. You must fax your request to the attention of Frank Pfeiffer at 401-528-5114, or by email to Frank.Pfeiffer@gsa.gov.  All requests must be accompanied by a completed Document Security Notice which will be validated prior to issuance of the CD. The Document Security Notice is posted separately under this solicitation number. Requests will not be honored from any prospective offeror who does not comply with the Document Security Notice and identification of its status as a qualified Hub Zone business.  P.O. Boxes cannot be used as a mailing address. Interested parties may also request a copy of these documents by writing to the Contracting Officer at the following address: General Services Administration (1Pl-RI), John O. Pastore FB and USPO, Room 102, Two Exchange Terrace, Providence, RI  02903. A pre-proposal meeting is tentatively scheduled for April 21, 2003. The proposal due date will be OOA April 28, 2003.

This RFP will be issued as a 100% small business set-aside competitive procurement. The building this equipment is to be housed in is limited in both width and height, and the ceiling grid-work demands that equipment be custom designed to fit within the allocated spaces. A site visit will be arranged to allow all offerors to scope the work required. It is strongly encouraged that all prospective bidders attend as it will be very difficult to adequately propose equipment without seeing the worksite first hand. Specifically, the curing oven shall be designed for an operating temperature of 130 to 500oF for the curing of powder coatings applied to equipment. Oven shall be designed to comply with either the overall dimensions of configuration (a), maximum 14' w x 24' d x 12' h; or the overall dimensions of configuration (b), maximum 14' w x 19' 6" d x 13' 6" h.  If configuration (a) is chosen for the curing oven, configuration (b) must be chosen for the spray booth, and vice versa. Oven shall operate on 460 V, 60 Hz, 3 phase power and a natural gas supply requirement of <1200 CFH service at 8” WCP at burner.  Specifically, the spray booth shall be designed to comply with either the overall dimensions of configuration (a), maximum 14' w x 24' d x 12' h; or the overall dimensions of configuration (b), maximum 14' w x 19' 6" d x 13' 6" h.  If configuration (a) is chosen for the spray booth, configuration (b) must be chosen for the curing oven, and vice versa.  Spray booth shall operate on 460 V, 60 Hz, 3 phase power and 60-100 psi compressed air requirement.  Specifically, the burn off oven shall be designed to operate at a maximum temperature of 800F with a minimum afterburner temperature of 1400F in order to remove cured powder coatings.  Approximate exterior dimensions are required to not exceed 15' w x 21' d x 12' h. Burn off oven shall operate on 460 V, 60 Hz, 3 phase power and on a natural gas supply requirement of <1 mil BTU/hr.  In addition to other relevant codes, the ovens  shall be in conformance with National Fire Protection Association Bulletin #86 for Class “A” ovens.  In addition to other relevant codes, the spray booth  shall be in conformance with National Fire Protection Association Standard No. 33. Installation, Start-up, training, and submission of logistical support data will also be required as part of the contract. This requirement shall be fulfilled by supplying “commercial items” as defined in Section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation). The estimated Issue Date for the RFP is 10 April 2003. This RFP will be posted on the NAVAIR web site at www.navair.navy.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is requesting proposals for the overhaul of a PT6A-27 engine, due to approaching Time Between Overhaul (3500 TBO), on their DeHavilland Twin Otter, FAA registration N48RF. The aircrafts primary mission, as an observation platform for marine mammals, requires low-level operation over salt water. The average flight lasts for duration of five hours, hence the low engine cycles. The engine has been on the Trend Group/Dallas Airmotive, Turbine Engine Monitoring Program (TEMP) since Nov 1990. Oil samples were taken every 100 hours up to Dec 2001 when the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) elected to take samples on condition. The engine will be delivered to the overhaul facility in serviceable condition, or as removed from an airworthy aircraft. This work will be performed during the August 2003/January 2004 time frame. Pertinent information applicable to the engine, estimated upon delivery to overhaul facility is as follows: Manufacturer: Pratt & Whitney, Model PT6A-27, Serial Number: PCE-41293, Time Since New: 16,575, Cycles Since New: 11,490, Time Since Overhaul: 3,500, Cycles Since Overhaul: 1,200, Last Overhaul: May. 96 (P&WC Brideport), Last Hot Section Insp.: May. 96.

The following air-worthiness directives have been previously complied with: 75-06-01, 75-11-04, 80-08-12, CF-78-03, CF-80-14. SCOPE: The contractor will provide all labor, materials, equipment, special tools and facilities to overhaul the engine to a zero time status. The government also needs the cost and availability of an overhauled exchange engine. The overhaul shall be in accordance with the Pratt & Whitney PT6A-27 overhaul manual. The contractor will replace all parts recommended by the manufacturer to be replaced at each overhaul regardless of their apparent condition, this includes but is not limited to gaskets, packing, rubber parts, lock washers, tab locks, etc. Only approved parts are to be used. PMA parts are preferred. The government and/or the contractor will remove the engine from the aircraft at the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida. The government may elect to have the contractor remove and reinstall the engine at their overhaul facility. The contractor overhauling the engine shall be responsible for shipping the PT6A-27 engine crate to the aircrafts location, and pay freight for shipment to and from the overhaul facility. The same applies to an overhauled exchange or loaner engine. Once the engine (S/N 41293) has been disassembled at the overhaul facility, the contractor will provide the government a tear down inspection report that includes the extent of the inspection, condition found of all major components, remaining rotable life limits, outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives that must be complied with, and any recommendations for maintenance actions for the prevention of further expense. Once the overhaul is complete the contractor shall run the engines on a test cell prior to reinstallation on the aircraft. The Contractor shall be responsible for all FAA and AOC reacquired documentation. Offerors are asked to provide a firm fixed price for tear down inspection, overhaul with known replacement parts, and run on a test cell prior to installation. 
Any life limited part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over and above. Since the government can not determine which parts or components if any meet this criteria offerors are asked to provide what labor rate they will charge the government per hour for over and above discrepancies. Secondly, offerors are asked to provide what percent discount off list price for replacement parts both new and overhauled. PMA parts are acceptable. In order to be responsive offerors must provide hull liability insurance of not less than $400,000 thousand to cover the engine on which this work will be performed. Offerers must provide proof that the facility performing the overhauls is an FAA approved repair station for PT6A-27 engines. A copy of the offeror's warranty, of 500 hours or one year of service whichever occurs first, must be included with the offer. ). Contract award will be based on the lowest price offer meeting the minimum specifications, using the commercial item acquisition process. The solicitation will be available on or about April 15, 2003.  Firms interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation should send a written request to the contracting officer, referencing this announcement number.  Requests may be made by fax (816) 426-7530) or e-mail.  This action is not set-aside for small business.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Biochemistry (LB), Biophysics Section,  has a need to lease with the option to purchase an FEI Tecnai G2 Polara system with Global Vantage Ltd., 1350 Old Bayshore Highway, Suite 500, Burlingame, California 94010. The acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR 13.5. The North American Industry Classification System code is 532490 and the business size standard is $6M.  Period of Performance: Upon award through September 2003 with a two option year period.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) and FAR Clause52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000) apply.  Without this instrumentation, the required scientific research and techniques cannot be carried out.  The Technai G2 Polara provides improved specimen stability and specimen protection, and will significantly enhance capabilities for 1) structural determination of membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes at atomic resolution. 2) structural determination of macromolecular assemblies from single particle imaging studies. 3) Electron tomograghic studies to visualize the 3-dimensional architecture of cells at molecular resolution.  Recent advances in electron microscopy have made molecular imaging on this scale possible on specimens that are not easy to study with X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. High resolution molecular imaging holds the key to unlocking the answers to many seemingly intractable biological problems in cancer and HIV/AIDS research, including cell-cell interactions, ligand-receptor binding, intracellular signaling and virus-mediated fusion. Only a few high resolution molecular imaging facilities exist in the world and NCI offers the environment necessary to support such an effort, including expertise in crystallography, molecular modeling, computational biology, and membrane protein biochemistry. The Tecnai G2 Polara system will be used for 1) structural determination of membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes at atomic resolution, 2) structural determination of macromolecular assemblies from single particle imaging studies and, 3) Electron tomographic studies to visualize the 3-dimensional architecture of cells at molecular resolution.  Global Vantage Ltd.  is the only source known to NCI that can provide this lease of the aforementioned instrument.  The Tecnai G2 Polara microscope must meet the following specifications: a) Absolute specimen drift at 70 degrees tilt of <25  /min; b) Maximal residual displacement of the compustage should not be more that 0.2um over a ±70 degree tilt range a cryogenic temperatures; c) ice contamination rate that is less that 4  /hour at liquid nitrogen temperatures; d) Cartridge loading system with capabilities for handling multiple specimens; and e) Hold time of liquid nitrogen reservoir not less than 12 hours.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, (local Washington DC time), on April 2, 2003.  If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via fax 301-402-4509 or via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No faxed copies of capability statements or electronic capability statements will be accepted.   All capability statements, one original and two copies  must sent to NIH/NCI/RCB, Malinda Holdcraft, 6120 Executive Blvd. Room 6072, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. More specifically, this is a Request for Comment. The Force Protection Command and Control Systems Program Office (ESC/FD) has developed an Interface Control Document for exchanging xml formatted data between sensor and display systems. It seeks to enable publish and subscribe capability for sensors and display systems that support Air Force Security Forces and other Force Protectors in DoD. This initiative is also a step forward in implementing ESC DAC Directive 002 (details located at  http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/C2ED_new/index.htm)  This initial release is intended to collect comments from industry developers, implementers and end users to mature this ICD. The comment period will extend until 18 April 2003. At that time we will coordinate this ICD for configuration control as an ICD managed at Electronic Systems Center Force Protection C2 Systems Program Office.  This forum on HERBB will be used to provide opportunity to comment on the Interface control document (ICD) and provide any updates to the ICD or related news. Please refer to the “available documents” section for additional information. Included is a status document that, in addition to status, will also point you to new documents as they are added (file name will be the date it is uploaded, yyyymmdd) and summarize any changes made to existing documents.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to issue a Request for Quotations under FAR Part 13—Simplified Acquisition Procedures for a pilot project to evaluate a pre-panel screening process for SBIR/STTR Phase I Proposals.  One hundred proposals in a specific technical area (to be determined) will be provided to the contractor for review by their technically qualified experts.  “Technically qualified expert” is defined as an individual with extensive technical business and/or academic experience in the area of technology, science and/or engineering that underlies the proposal being reviewed.  For each proposal, the contractor will provide three reviews and a summary of the reviewers’ findings and recommendation, consistent with the NSF review criteria.  See  http://www.eng.nsf.gov/sbir/peer_review.htm.  Of the 100 proposals, the contractor will identify approximately 50 that can be recommended for submission to the existing NSF review panel process.  The SBIR/STTR program will also submit the same 100 proposals to the current NSF panel review process, and will compare results to determine the effectiveness of the contractor’s screening process.  The period of performance is expected to begin June 1 and end October 31.  NSF anticipates award of the pilot project to no more than three qualified offerors.  The RFQ is anticipated to be available on FedBizOps and the NSF website (www.nsf.gov) on or about March 24.  See Note 1 and 26.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a NSDI plan for Thailand.  The NSDI plan will facilitate the generation and exchange of vital geographic information between governmental and non-governmental users for the sustainable development of natural resources, agriculture, environment monitoring, town planning, transportation planning, telecommunications, disaster mitigation, and improved quality of life.

Within its Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA), the Thai Government has a compelling focus for developing a framework for a more efficient and productive application of GIS throughout the country. GISTDA’s proposed NSDI plan will help the government meet these goals.  NSDI is defined as the technologies, policies and people necessary to promote sharing of geospatial data throughout all levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, and the academic community.  GISTDA plans to implement a pilot NSDI system within this year and to proceed with nationwide implementation beginning in 2004-2005.

The tasks that would be completed by the U.S. firm for the project would include: (1) studying organization and conducting initial meeting, (2) preparing a functional requirements report, (3) developing an implementation and investment plan, (4) developing financing options, and (5) providing a final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $207,600 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, April 25, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), NETC Acquisition Section, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with OMNI Corporation (OMNI), an extension of the performance period for  contract number EME-98-CO-0002 for continuation of on-site facility operation, maintenance and student support services for the U.S. Fire Administration located in Emmitsburg, Maryland. FEMA is in the process of issuing a competitive solicitation that will be synopsized on FedBizOpps in April, 2003.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for the current contract will be extended for three (3) months, with one-month option periods.  Services shall include but are not limited to providing all resources, including labor, supervision, tools, equipment, parts, vehicles, vehicle and equipment fuels, necessary to operate, maintain and repair of the facilities and utilities and to perform other functions such as architectural and engineering services, scheduled maintenance services, trade craft services, landscaping services, housekeeping services, student support services, warehouse and supply functions of receiving, inspection, storage, packing, shipping, material handling and associated services for the operation of the warehouse, mail and courier services, copy and duplication services, and other services. Due to the type of services required, it is necessary to maintain consistency and uninterrupted facility operations, maintenance and student support services at the facility in order to continue the national training programs and to maintain and operate the facility. It is not economically feasible for a new contractor to mobilize and perform this extensive work effort for 3 months. Based on OMNI’s comprehensive knowledge of the USFA mission, the complex systems which support the facility, its evolving integrated support service requirements, familiarity with the Union for Housekeeping Personnel, and their broad technical expertise, OMNI is in a unique position to provide the operation, maintenance and student support services for the extension period. OMNI is the only known source that possesses both the intimate knowledge of the facility and the resources required to ensure continuity of services at the facility for this period.  Entering into a new contract for the period of this extension would be detrimental to the government.  The statutory authority that permits other than full and open competition for this requirement is in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

<ARCHDATE>06172003
<CONTACT>Patricia Jarvis, Contracting Officer, 781-377-3956
<DESC>The Information Exploitation Systems (SRH) Program Office seeks to upgrade Eagle Vision through the addition of RADARSAT 2 satellite capabilities using existing commercial-off-the-shelf products.  This is a request for information (RFI) only.  It is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), or Solicitation, or an indication that the government will contract for these items.  The government will not pay for information received in response to this RFI.  Eagle Vision is a system that collects and processes commercial satellite (SPOT, LandSat 5 and 7, RADARSAT, and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS)) imagery.  It is composed of two elements: a Data Acquisition Segment (DAS) and a Data Integration Segment (DIS).  The DAS includes an antenna, a shelter and transit-cased processing equipment that collects and processes imagery into standard commercial formats.  The DIS processes the standard commercial format products into Controlled Image Based (CIB) formatted products for use in the combat commander's mission planning/rehearsal and intelligence gathering systems.  The added RADARSAT 2 capability will allow Eagle Vision to program the satellite, receive and archive the telemetry, and process the data into CEOS, CIB and NITF imagery.  The RADARSAT 2 capability will be able to produce imagery from synthetic aperture radar (SAR).  All RADARSAT 2 supported beam modes and polarization are required.  The upgrades will remain compatible with and be seamlessly integrated into the existing Eagle Vision systems. Interested parties are invited to provide technical information, cost of system, and describe customer base and experience providing such products. Completion of all work is required no later than 12 months after award of contract.  The earliest anticipated award date is May 2004.  Please provide the name of your firm, address, point of contact, phone/fax, and an electronic mail address, if available.  Total contract value is anticipated to be under $2M. This synopsis does not constitute a RFP or an Invitation for Bid (IFB) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for information solicited.  Interested parties should provide product information meeting the above stated requirements no later than 20 days from the date of this notice.  All responders are requested to indicate if they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern or woman-owned small business.  In addition, contractors will indicate whether or not their equipment and services are offered through the GSA schedule or any other government-wide agency contract.  Contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting (CCR) System. The government may solicit firms meeting the screening criteria in this synopsis.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The facility will be constructed on BOP property adjacent to the existing federal correctional institution at United States Penitentiary (USP) Hazelton, West Virginia.  The proposed project is currently planned to consist of a group of buildings in a “campus plan” arrangement with related site utilities and site development. This Secure Woman’s Facility will have a gross building area of approximately 22,000 square meters and be designed to house and support approximately 512 inmates.  

The anticipated performance period of this project is 800 calendar days - after the notice to proceed is issued.  

The estimated magnitude of this project is expected to be more than $10,000,000.  

For consideration on this project the offeror at a minimum must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer firm, or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture, must have an existing active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications,  located within the State of West Virginia.  The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects or engineers registered in the State of West Virginia to practice in the particular professional field involved.  Participation by architects, engineers, consultants and subcontractors located within the State of West Virginia is encouraged.

Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZone small businesses, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses is encouraged.  The Offerors included in Phase Two will be required to submit a subcontracting plan for this procurement regarding the utilization of small, small-disadvantaged, small woman-owned, veteran-owned small businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  

The FBOP will be utilizing two-phase Design-Build selection procedures.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  Interested offerors may request and obtain a Phase One solicitation of the two phase process, distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitations will not be available.  The web site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  Phase One solicitations will be issued on or about April 16, 2003.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One Solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work,  evaluation factors including:  Past Performance (Sub-factors: Past  Performance Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment of Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems), Capability to Perform, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence and Technical Approach and submission information for interested Design-Build firms to prepare their Phase One qualification proposals.  Phase One qualification proposals will be evaluated to determine which firms will be selected as offerors for Phase Two.  Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, small business and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation.  The Phase Two evaluation factors (Past Performance Sub-factors: Past Performance Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment of Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems);  Preliminary Design and Proposed Technical Solutions;  Proposed Organization and Key Personnel, Consultants and Subcontractors;  Management and Scheduling Approach;  Small Business Subcontracting;  Plan for Quality Assurance and Quality Control)  are significantly more important than Price, however, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.  Additional or Bonus points may be awarded for Technical, Past Performance, and/or Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization proposals.

<DESC>NA The Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) Project Office will host a Presolicitation Conference on 27 Mar 03 to present current information on the U. S. Army’s projected procurement of a Surface-Launched AMRAAM (Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile) (SLAMRA AM) system.  The briefing will be held in the Rocket Auditorium, Building 7120, Redstone Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.  Registration is 0730-0830; the briefing will begin promptly at 0830.   The SLAMRAAM Product Manager will provide the latest information to industry regarding the Army’s SLAMRAAM mission and will solicit industry for constructive comments.  Program details, key events, and the acquisition approach will be discussed.  Speakers will address cruise missile defense, E-Strike, C4I hardware, JLENS, and Sentinel upgrades, and the interrelationship of these capabilities within the SLAMRAAM system.  The Government anticipates the selection, through the “best value” competitive source se lection process, of a prime contractor that will accomplish system development and demonstration, as well as engineering, production, integration, training, and logistics.   Performance under the SLAMRAAM contract will require the prime contractor to have a U. S.-issued SECRET facility security clearance and be able to receive, generate, and store up to SECRET classified material and to provide personnel with U. S.-issued Secr et security clearances for contract performance.   Performance under the SLAMRAAM contract will require prime contractor access to defense information that is not considered appropriate for release to non-U. S. companies.

<CONTACT>MAURICE BROWN, 703-602-3731
<DESC>NA Email (Word or Excel) responses to Maurice C. Brown, email: brownmc@hqda.army.mil Overview: Years of program development and research have provided effective strategies for strengthening America’s families to prevent child and spouse abuse.  A document or series of documents shall help program planners, policy makers and service providers determi ne the most effective family focused and parenting prevention and intervention strategies for the families that they serve.  This guide shall review what is currently known in the research literature about the impact of family characteristics on risk for c hild and spouse abuse as well as the most promising family change interventions.  FAP educators and providers using the guide will be better able to choose or modify existing programs or create new interventions for high-risk families in their communities. Deliverables:   1.  The guide will contain four major sections: Part l:  Family Influence on Child and Spouse Abuse This section shall help FAP personnel understand the factors that influence child and spouse abuse and why certain family strengthening approaches reduce the likelihood of abuse.  Additionally, research literature on the types of family characteristics tha t impact child and spouse abuse statistics, reporting, rates and family protective and resilience facts are reported in this section. Part II: Review of Family Strengthening Programs This section reviews program strategies shown to be effective in preventing problems that lead to child and/or spouse abuse.  Various approaches including family and parenting approaches, youth violence, dating violence, couples communication are described .  Issues of cost-effectiveness of prevention programs are also addressed.  Effective and promising prevention and intervention strategies are shown in a matrix of program types by age of child and severity of family or child problems.  Family-focused inte rventions appear to be more effective than either child-focused or parent-focused approaches and will be the focus for the matrix.  For spouse abuse strategies, the matrix shall be shown by program type, age of youth to adult, and type and severity of aggr ession, violence. Part III: Principles of Effective Family-Based Programs This section provides a “cook book” that suggests that there is no single best family-based program.  Rather, effective programs tend to have several principles that guide their implementation activities.  FAP educators and MTF treatment providers can revi ew these principles outlined in a step-by-step implementation guide and incorporate them in selecting and planning family-based programs.  Critical issues such as recruitment, attrition, and staff training and program evaluation are addressed.  Prevention and intervention models addressed in Part IV may be outlined and included in the “cook book.”   Part IV: FAP Prevention, Intervention model endorsement This section describes a national search to find the highest quality family-based prevention programs and outlines the strategy designed to disseminate this information.  The programs selected are identified and additional instruction is provided on how to  utilize the information provided.  The final section presents a brief description, point of contact, cost, and additional information as required for parenting/family programs in categories from Exemplary I, Exemplary II, Model and Promising.   2.  Contractor shall prepare presentation materials that guide discussion and development of a common understanding of Standardization of primary and secondary prevention programs. The contractor shall provide an example of prevention and intervention prog ram matrix for child and spouse abuse for the following demographics as part of presentation materials: a.	Installation with a young troop population, 300+ live births a month, with little civilian community resources. b.	Installation with a senior troop population, teenage children with middle and senior high school off post, and on post with civilian community resources. c.	Overseas locations with young troop population 300+ live births a month, in an isolated location. d.	Overseas location with senior troop population, teenage children with DoDDS middle and senior high. 3.  The contractor shall develop a project plan that outlines key project deliverables and associated due dates. 4.  The contractor shall provide a monthly report of actions completed during the previous month, actions pending for the next month and status of labor hours to support the above tasks.  5.  Draft documents shall be provided by the contractor for review by the FAPM for final approval.  All recommendations for changes to documents shall be adhered to by the contractor.   6.  Initial and subsequent shipping of documents shall be the responsibility of the contractor.  The contractor shall provide a monthly report of shipments to the field. 7.	All documents and materials are the sole property of the United States Army.  8.  The period of performance  is six months. 9.  Deliverables:  97 books in binders and one master on re-writeable CD Roms

Answer:    They can be used for distress.

Question 14:  What is the expected usage profile (i.e., what percentage terminal-to-landline, what
                       percentage terminal-to-terminal, etc.)?

Answer:    We do not have past data to reflect the percentage of use for terminal-to-terminal
                  or terminal-to-landline.

Question 15: Will service rates from foreign Land Earth Station Operators (LESOs) be acceptable
                      as the basis for bid evaluation and award?

                 Mini-M’s.

Question 16:  Must all rates bid for this solicitation be based on a single LESO?

Answer:    Yes.

Question 17:  May separate rates and/or LESOs be bid for STU and non-STU calls?  For different
                       zones?

Answer:    We would like one rate for all calls within a specific zone.

Question 18:  Will offerors be required to disclose the LESO upon which bid rates are based (i.e.,

Answer:    Yes.

Question 19:  Will the STU-III requirement require the Secure Inter-working function (SIWF) protocol?

                  specified in the solicitation, additional information (past performance or technical
                  capability of offeror, for example) is neither requested nor desired by your office.

Answer:    No additional information is required.  Price and only price related factors. 

Question 23:  Can you provide an average for the airtime used on your existing Mini-M units:

Answer:   Average monthly Coast Guard usage for Mini-M is around 7000 minutes/month.

Question 24:  Is there a monthly usage that we should project to?  In other words, do we assume 100
                  minutes per month per Mini-M ( as an example)?  Also, is the total population of Mini-Ms
                  assumed to be 80, 100 or 180?
                

Answer:   Assume monthly usage of current Mini-M’s to be around 7000 minutes.
                 Currently there are about 80 terminals, with that number doubling by the end of 2003.

Question 25:  How many Mini-M air-time minutes/month were used by the current Mini-M terminals.
                  How many terminals produced those air-time minutes.

Answer:     80 active terminals, about 30-40 terminals account for around 7000 minutes/month.

Question 26:  What is the current air-time price/minutes that the Coast Guard is paying?  

Answer:   This information can not be provided.  The current award was not awarded as full and open
                 but under GSA Schedule contract.

Question 27:  Is there a particular format that the bid has to be in or can I just send a letter with my
                       prices?

Answer:   A letter with your prices would be fine.  Also include a statement whether or not you can
                 provide billing information to reflect each terminals’ monthly usage/call duration/call
                 destination/cost per call.

Question 28:  We would like an extension of the bid deadline until April 15th.  Is that possible?

Answer:   No extension will be granted.

Question 29:  Will the USCG consider the Iridium system as a viable option for this?

Answer:   No, Iridium cannot be used due to previously engineered solutions (interoperability).

Question 30:  Can you provide an average for the airtime used on your existing Mini-M units?

Answer:   Average monthly Coast Guard usage for Mini-M is around 7000 minutes/month.

Question 31:  Could you tell us as to the total monthly usage (in minutes) by STU versus other
                  INMARSAT usage for the U.S. Coast Guard, 80 vessel fleet.

Answer:  We do not have any data to provide you with an answer of how many minutes/month
               are via STU-III for our Thrane and Thrane 3064’s.  STU-III is highly utilized, monthly
               usage is about 7000 minutes Coast Guard wide.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number F73OTJ30141100 is being issued as Request of Quotation (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the test program for certain commercial items found at FAR Part 13.5.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-14, and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Defense Change Notice (DCN) 20030301.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions.  This acquisition is full and open competition.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 511130 with a size standard of 500 employees. CLIN 0001: Textbook set (to include textbook, student workbook, and instructor materials). Offeror shall provide all personnel, equipment, material and other items necessary to provide the deliverables (Aerospace Sciences: Exploration of Space Textbook, along with student workbooks and instructor resources) specified in the attached Statement of Work. The government reserves the right to evaluate for award the most advantageous pricing based on the following quantities – 25,000 printed copies (Hardcover – adhesive binding) or 15,000 printed copies (Hardcover– adhesive binding) or 25,000 printed copies (Softcover) or 15,000 printed copies (Softcover).

Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items (July 2002), DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items (Nov 1995), and DFARS 252.225-7000, Buy American Act-Balance Payment Program Certificate (Sep 1999) with the quotation.  Clauses and provisions may be accessed via the Internet, http://farsite. hill.af.mil or www.arnet.far.gov.  The following clauses and provisions are incorporated by reference and are to remain in full force in any resultant purchase order.  FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items (Oct 2000) applies to this acquisition.  The following paragraphs of this clause are addended as follows: (b)(4) Offeror shall include one (1) product sample of a textbook, student textbooks, and instructor materials written and published by the offeror in sufficient detail to evaluate offeror’s technical capability to satisfy this requirement and (b)(10) Offer shall include at least two (2) references for it’s most recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items, including contract number and point of contact, including telephone number. Submit signed and dated quotations with company name, address, phone number, email address and point of contact.  Basis for award:  This is a competitive best value source selection.  Technical factors (adherence to SOW and sample) will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Past and present performance will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to price.  An offeror’s proposed prices will be determined by adding the quantities identified in CLINs 0001 and 0002 to confirm the extended amount of each CLIN.  CLINs 0001 and 0002 will be totaled to determine the overall price to be evaluated. The contracting officer shall seek performance information on the technically acceptable offerors based on the references provided by the offerors and data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offer’s ability to perform the effort described in this RFQ based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall confidence rating of the following:  
Exceptional/High Confidence:  Based on the offeror's performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Very Good/Significant Confidence:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
Satisfactory/Confidence:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Neutral/Unknown Confidence:  No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) and (iv)). 
Marginal/Little Confidence:  Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Changes to the offeror's existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements.
Unsatisfactory/No Confidence:  Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
The evaluation will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.  Offerors with no relevant past performance information shall receive the rating of “NEUTRAL” meaning the rating is treated neither favorable nor unfavorable. If the lowest price evaluated technically acceptable offer is judged to have an exceptional confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. The Government reserves the right to award a purchase order to other than the lowest evaluated price.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information as specified in this RFQ.    Offers may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information (PPI) to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse PPI is considered to be information resulting in an overall risk rating of unsatisfactory or marginal.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The Government, however, reserve the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.  The contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Award will be made to a single source.  The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Feb 2002) is incorporated into this RFP and is addended to add the following clause: 52.204-4, Printed or Copied Double-sided on Recycled Paper.  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order-Commercial (May 2002) is applicable.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS.  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  This is a two-step design/build construction project, Request for Proposals, Number N68950-03-R-0014.

It is the intent and objective of the Government to obtain services including labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision required for the design and construction of a Battle Stations facility on the RTC campus.  The Battle Stations portion will provide simulation training to help prepare Sailors to meet the immediate needs of the Fleet and will effectively combine immersive training techniques with “reality based” Navy training scenarios.  This will be the signature RTC building and comply with the Base Exterior Architecture Plan.  The mission of the Battle Stations Project is to create a flexible, modular, immersive learning experience that will provide a more effective, comprehensive learning environment for new recruits.  The project encompasses approximately 192,200 square feet, housing Battle Stations, RTC Headquarters & Administration, Recruit Division Commanders School and the Photography Lab.  The RFP will provide the complete project program, site survey, utilities and geo-technical investigations, hazardous materials investigations, and performance specifications.  The RFP will not include a floor plan or design solution.

The estimated cost of the entire project is in the range of $70,000,000 to $80,000,000.  The NAICS Code 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, Size Standard NTE $28,500,000 applies to this project.  The project will be incrementally funded with approximately 15% of project funds available in Fiscal Year 2004 and the balance available in Fiscal Year 2005.  The Funding Appropriation is subject to the President signing the MILCON Bills for Fiscal Year 2004 and Fiscal Year 2005.  No organizational conflict of interest prohibitions will be applicable to this RFP per FAR 9.505-2(b)(3).  

Phase I Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available for viewing and downloading on April 4, 2003.  Proposal due date is May 9, 2003, 12:00 noon.  The solicitation is formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors’ proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.

This solicitation will consist of two (2) phases.  Phase I is the qualification phase.  Up to five (5) firms will be pre-qualified to participate in Phase II.  The Navy will determine which offerors proceed to Phase II.  The evaluation factors for Phase I are as follows:  Past Performance/Technical Qualifications (Facility Design, Artistic/Creative Design, Instructional Design, Equipment, Sets and Software Design, and Construction), Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and Management Approach.  

Upon determination of the contractors advancing to Phase II, those offerors will receive a draft RFP and final scenario conceptual design deliverables.  A pre-proposal conference will be held providing: storyline, training objectives, special effects, facility/program information; a tour of existing Battle Stations; a brief on an Arliegh Burke Ship; and discussions with the Navy.  Phase II will include the following evaluation factors:  Past Performance / Technical Qualifications; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; Conceptual Design (Drawings, Schedules, Computer Model, Square Footage Calculation); Training Systems Design; Durability, Maintainability, Sustainability of Building Systems and Training Device Systems; Project Schedule and Phasing; and Price.  

Unsuccessful offerors participating in Phase II of the project may receive a proposal stipend up to $100,000.  

The Government intends on issuing the RFP Solicitation for Phase I and Phase II through the Internet at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.   All prospective offerors and plan rooms MUST register themselves on the website.  The download time may be excessive, but all contractors are encouraged to attempt download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.  Many firms and commercial printing services have the capability to print the solicitation package and plan holders list off the Internet, if necessary.  The official planholders list will be created by registration and be available from the website only.  Amendments will also be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method of distributing amendments, therefore, it is the offeror’s responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.  For inquiries about Phase I proposal, please contact Katie Kuehn, 847-688-2600 x 103, email kuehnkj@efdsouth.navfac.navy.mil.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All contractors submitting bids, proposals or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of the contract.

<DESC>Reference is made to the February 12, 2003 Fedbizopps announcement, Solicitation Number Reference-Number-0250016A, inviting the submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the “Proposal”) for the above study for SANEPAR in Brazil.  This is to notify interested U.S. firms that the deadline for the submission of proposals has been extended from March 24, 2003 to no later than 5:00PM local time on May 5, 2003.  SANEPAR requested this extension in order to allow the new Board of Directors time to nominate the selection committee and to become familiar with this project.  

In addition, please note that proposals should be addressed to:

POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Companhia de Saneamento do Parana-SANEPAR Grupo Especifico de Consultoria Intercambio e Pesquisa-GECIP Rua Engenheiros Reboucas 1376 CEP 80215 900 Curitiba, Parana Brasil, Tel: (55) (41) 330-3048, Fax: (55) (41) 330-3109  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the industrial reuse of treated sewage in Curitiba and Londrina, Brazil.

The project sponsor, Companhia de Saneamento do Parana (SANEPAR), is a water and wastewater services company owned 60% by the state of Parana and 40% by Andrade Gutierrez, SA, Copel Opportunity Daleth, SA and Vivendi. The company operates 630 systems in 40 municipalities in Parana, which supply nearly 14.5 million cubic meters of water per month to residential, commercial and industrial users.

SANEPAR is interested in establishing an industrial water reuse business.  The near-term market will include industries in Curitiba and Londrina, which represents a potential demand for 500 liters per second of treated water.  The long-term market throughout the state of Paran? is estimated to be 2,300 liters per second.  Currently, SANEPAR?s industrial client base is small relative to its total customer base, which is composed of primarily residential customers.  Its ability to develop a market for the reuse of water will depend on developing a new market outside of its current customer base.  SANEPAR has an initial target market of 13 large industrial facilities in Curitiba, which currently receive about 105,000 cubic meters per month of potable water from SANEPAR. The consumption of reuse water by these companies would encourage other local industries currently relying on their own wells.  The Curitiba market could be served by water reuse systems operating at four to eight locations in the Curitiba area and an additional three to five systems in the Londrina area. The investment required to develop the industrial water reuse market in Curitiba and Londrina in the near term is estimated at $21 million, while at the long term rate of 2,300 liters per second, would be $95 million.

The terms of reference for the feasibility study would include the following tasks: 1) identify large and medium industries and select representative sample to be surveyed, 2) case study development, and 3) financial and implementation plan.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $115,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by 5:00PM local Curitiba time, March 24, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>This solicitation issue date is extended from 18 Mar to 24 Mar 03.


DSCC is soliciting for an Automotive Prime Vendor (Worldwide.)  These parts will be used by the U.S. Armed Forces.  

Our goal will be to provide worldwide logistics support for automotive-type items.  A Prime Vendor (PV) will be awarded the contract to provide 1) DLA non-stocked NSNs, 2) price listed and 3) non-price listed CAGE and P/N items.  There will also be an unpriced feature, that allows for ordering items by CAGE and P/N (when not already priced).  

The PV will assume total supply chain management, which includes:  inventory management, distribution, parts acquisition and material forecasting.    The PV must possess the ability to source miscellaneous vehicular engine and power transmission equipment and to provide delivery based on requisition priority.  The PV will be required to interface directly with the military customer to provide both support of parts and method of support as the customer’s environment changes.  

The PV will be required to receive and transmit by Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  The Government will transmit orders by EDI using conventions and formats prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12 and the Department of Defense (DoD) Implementation Guidelines for the transfer of acquisition data and invoicing.  

The anticipated initial contract period will be for two years beginning on the date of award, with eight option years for a total of ten years.  

Access to the NSNs and P/Ns included on this solicitation can be downloaded from http://dibbs.dscc.dla.mil/Rfp/ on the date of issue.

<DESC>NA This is a Sources Sought Statement of Work.  This is not a solicitation or a request for proposals.  The Government is not obligated to award any contract or pay for any cost by the contractor.  The Government is requesting cost estimates for the SOW below .  Email estimated cost for project to Maurice C. Brown at brownmc@hqda.army.mil Overview: Years of program development and research have provided effective strategies for strengthening America’s families to prevent child and spouse abuse.  A document or series of documents shall help program planners, policy makers and service providers determi ne the most effective family focused and parenting prevention and intervention strategies for the families that they serve.  This guide shall review what is currently known in the research literature about the impact of family characteristics on risk for c hild and spouse abuse as well as the most promising family change interventions.  FAP educators and providers using the guide will be better able to choose or modify existing programs or create new interventions for high-risk families in their communities. Deliverables:   1.  The guide will contain four major sections: Part l:  Family Influence on Child and Spouse Abuse This section shall help FAP personnel understand the factors that influence child and spouse abuse and why certain family strengthening approaches reduce the likelihood of abuse.  Additionally, research literature on the types of family characteristics tha t impact child and spouse abuse statistics, reporting, rates and family protective and resilience facts are reported in this section. Part II: Review of Family Strengthening Programs This section reviews program strategies shown to be effective in preventing problems that lead to child and/or spouse abuse.  Various approaches including family and parenting approaches, youth violence, dating violence, couples communication are described .  Issues of cost-effectiveness of prevention programs are also addressed.  Effective and promising prevention and intervention strategies are shown in a matrix of program types by age of child and severity of family or child problems.  Family-focused inte rventions appear to be more effective than either child-focused or parent-focused approaches and will be the focus for the matrix.  For spouse abuse strategies, the matrix shall be shown by program type, age of youth to adult, and type and severity of aggr ession, violence. Part III: Principles of Effective Family-Based Programs This section provides a “cook book” that suggests that there is no single best family-based program.  Rather, effective programs tend to have several principles that guide their implementation activities.  FAP educators and MTF treatment providers can revi ew these principles outlined in a step-by-step implementation guide and incorporate them in selecting and planning family-based programs.  Critical issues such as recruitment, attrition, and staff training and program evaluation are addressed.  Prevention and intervention models addressed in Part IV may be outlined and included in the “cook book.”   Part IV: FAP Prevention, Intervention model endorsement This section describes a national search to find the highest quality family-based prevention programs and outlines the strategy designed to disseminate this information.  The programs selected are identified and additional instruction is provided on how to  utilize the information provided.  The final section presents a brief description, point of contact, cost, and additional information as required for parenting/family programs in categories from Exemplary I, Exemplary II, Model and Promising.   2.  Contractor shall prepare presentation materials that guide discussion and development of a common understanding of Standardization of primary and secondary prevention programs. The contractor shall provide an example of prevention and intervention prog ram matrix for child and spouse  abuse for the following demographics as part of presentation materials: a.	Installation with a young troop population, 300+ live births a month, with little civilian community resources. b.	Installation with a senior troop population, teenage children with middle and senior high school off post, and on post with civilian community resources. c.	Overseas locations with young troop population 300+ live births a month, in an isolated location. d.	Overseas location with senior troop population, teenage children with DoDDS middle and senior high. 3.  The contractor shall develop a project plan that outlines key project deliverables and associated due dates. 4.  The contractor shall provide a monthly report of actions completed during the previous month, actions pending for the next month and status of labor hours to support the above tasks.  5.  Draft documents shall be provided by the contractor for review by the FAPM for final approval.  All recommendations for changes to documents shall be adhered to by the contractor.   6.  Initial and subsequent shipping of documents shall be the responsibility of the contractor.  The contractor shall provide a monthly report of shipments to the field. 7.	All documents and materials are the sole property of the United States Army.  8.  The period of performance  is six months. 9.  Deliverables:  97 copies with binders and one re-writable master CD Roms

<DESC>Request for Information from the German construction industry.  The United States Air Forces in Europe Contracting Squadron (USAFE CONS) is engaged in acquisition planning for a follow-on contract to the current Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER) contract.  The Air Force is considering the use of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract for this follow-on acquisition.  An IDIQ "multiple award contract" means that multiple contracts are awarded for the same requirement and, after award of the basic contract, each separate delivery order issued under the contract will competed between the multiple award contractors.  The Civil Engineering Support Flight (USAFE CONS/LGCC) would like to have written inputs from the German construction industry on the following questions:  (1)  What would be your company response to the use of an IDIQ multiple award contract for a SABER follow-on contract?  (2)  Assuming that 30 to 50 SABER projects may need to placed on contract during the month of September of each year (the end of the U.S. Government fiscal year), what recommendations would your company have for streamlining the competitive proposal process under a multiple award IDIQ contract to ensure that all SABER projects could be awarded by 30 September? (3)  If a multiple award IDIQ SABER contract were used, would your company require the payment of proposal preparation costs for each competitive proposal prepared?  Please send e-mails to Mr Arthur Trader at arthur.trader@ramstein.af.mil or Ms Birgit Tilley at Birgit.Tilley@ramstein.af.mil.  Faxes may be sent to Mr Arthur Trader or Ms Birgit Tilley at 0631-536-8447.

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is seeking Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Desktop and Portal Explosive Detection Equipment (EDE) capable of finding the explosives in terrorist Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) that pose hazards to military operations in mail, parcels, cargo, vehicles, and on personnel.  This market survey solicits vendors' information that fully explains their existing technology features, capabilities, and performance.  In the future, subject to availability of funds, NAVEODTECHDIV may select EDE systems for testing and evaluation to meet Department of Defense Antiterrorism / Force Protection and Physical Security requirements.  Results of any testing and evaluation will be collected and made available to DoD interest. Technologies of IED detection that protect the force and prevent terrorist bombings against milita ry personnel, equipment and military installations by finding them at points of entry are sought.  These technologies include, but are not limited to, trace (particle or vapor) detectors.   Ideally, these technologies will allow antiterrorist/force protection/physical security personnel to find IEDs effectively and reliably, while inspecting mail, parcels, cargo, vehicles, and personnel (to include personal articles carried by personnel) for IEDs at military installations' entry points without slowing throughput.  This announcement serves to survey product availability, and is NOT a formal solicitation and is NOT an RFP.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes ONLY, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Interested entities are encouraged to respond by providing their company name, points of contact, a technical description of five or fe wer pages and b) two Summary Charts for each model of their EDE., and business size. Additional information may be obtained from Mr. Valter Ezerins  at (301) 744-6850 x 222 or e-mail ezerinsV@eodpoe2.navsea.navy.mil.  Each submission shall be transmitted electronically and in hard copy format to:  Commander, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division, 2008 Stump Neck Road, Indian Head, MD, 20640-5070 attn Margaret Booth code 0521 not later than 30 April 2003.  Technical Description Format 1.  General Information. 1.1.  Vendor Information.  Name, address, point of contact, email and postal address, telephone number, and related WebPages, if applicable. 1.2.   System.  Desktop and / or Portal EDE name and model. 1.3.   Function.  Objects of interest that EDE can inspect for the explosives in IEDs (for example, mail, small parcels, and personal articles carr ied by personnel). 1.4.  System Picture.  Two photographs of EDE:  a) oblique color photograph of instrument alone with key non-consumable accessories that will enable viewer to understand relative dimensions in inches, and b) action photograph of EDE inspecting objects of interest for IEDs. 1.5.   Technology.  A brief description of the technology used by this product consisting of the technology title and five or fewer descriptive sentences.  1.6.   Output.  Samples of output produced directly by the EDE while in operation that identifies the explosives present in the IED in the object of interest.  Examples of output include images of graphical / tabular data of chemical composition. 2.  Performance Parameters for EDE.  The following Performance Parameters measure EDE performance in inspecting representative IEDs at the point of entry onto military installations unde r typical Point of Entry operational and environmental conditions. 2.1.  Detection Effectiveness.  Detection Effectiveness, measured as a percentage from the ratio below, consists of the number of successful IED detections compared to the number of objects of interest inspected.   2.1.1.  Successful Detections include: a) True Positives - EDE determines the presence of explosives in IEDs.  b) True Negatives – EDE determines that explosives are not present when explosives are not present.  2.1.2.  Unsuccessful detections include:  a) False Positives - EDE determines that there are explosives present when explosives are NOT present, and b) False Negatives - EDE determines that there are no explosives present when explosives ARE present. 2.1.3.  IED may include the following explosives:  ANFO, RDX/C4, TNT, PETN, Semtex, Chlorates, Water Gels, Black Powders, Smokeless Powders , and Dynamites. 	Effectiveness =      Number of Successful IED Detections Number of Objects of Interest Ready to Be Inspected 2.2.   Detection Speed.  Detection Speed, measured in objects of interest per hour, is the number of objects of interest (mail, parcels, pallets of cargo, persons, or vehicles) that can be fully inspected per hour, once the EDE is operational.  Inspecting time is defined as the minimum time interval possible between the start of an object of interest and the start of the succeeding object of interest at the point of entry, e. g. total time for inspector to collect samples from vehicle at inspection point, and the subsequent collection and analysis at the guard house.  EDE preparation and analysis time for that object of interest (excluding initial EDE operation time, self-checks, etc.). Detection Speed = Number of Objects of Interest Inspected One hour 2.3.   Ease of Use.  Ease of Use, rated as "Simple, Average or Difficult," is a subjective evaluation based upon the level of difficulty for operator to correctly operate and detect the explosive in an IED in the object of interest at the Point of Entry under standard conditions. 2.4.   Portability.  Portability consists of two functions – transport of the main component of the EDE to the Point of Entry administrative facility, and the physical movement of the EDE and/or IED to allow analysis by the main component of the EDE.  This requirement will be assessed in terms of the time, manpower and operational situational needs of operators manning the Point of Entry. 2.5.   Reliability.  Reliability is measured by the degree that the HHEDE will complete the HHEDE mission without an operational mission failure for all objects requiring screening.  Inability of H HEDE to indicate the presence of an explosive constitutes an operational mission failure.   2.6.   Maintainability.  Maintainability (Mean Time Between Maintenance), measured in hours, is the duration of time that, on average the EDE will function as designed without maintenance beyond actions that can be performed by the operator with a prescribed list of spare parts and/or consumable supplies. 3.  Standard Conditions and Threat.  These standard conditions and representative IEDs are intended to provide a common basis for comparing each EDE’s features, capabilities, and performance against user-defined requirements. 	3.1.  Representative IEDs.  Representative IEDs shall be used as objects of interest that contain typical explosives that might convey through the Point of Entry.  The IEDs shall consist of various explosives that might be contained in or on mail, small p arcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves.   	3.2.  Typical Operational Scenario.  EDE will be used to non-intrusively inspect mail, small parcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves that might convey through the Point of Entry. 	3.3.  Typical Environmental Conditions.  The Point of Entry will have standard U. S. electrical power supply of 110V AC / 220V AC @ 50-60 Hz. Ambient weather / climatic conditions are expected to:  a) range from 0 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, b) range from 10 to 95% humidity, c) barometric pressure ranges from sea level to 3000 feet above sea level, and d) may contain saltwater spray, dust, rain, or snow.  	3.4.  Typical Operator Abilities.  The operator is:  a) a soldier, sailor, airman or marine, b) capable of carrying components up to 35 pounds, c) has a High School diploma, d) supplied w ith vendor's written manuals, and e) trained for ONE eight-hour day of instruction on the proper operation of the equipment to detect an IED in the object of interest. 3.  System Description and Characteristics. 3.1.   Size. Outside dimensions in feet and inches.  Weight of each component in pounds. 3.2.   Limitations / Hazards / Special Requirements.  State any special EDE limitations, hazards and/or special requirements beyond conditions stated herein to include hazards, such as radiation sources or toxic chemicals.  Include a copy of radioactive material license documentation from Nuclear Regulatory Commission, if applicable. 3.3.  Special Features / Capabilities.  Summarize any special EDE features or capabilities not contained herein that improve the overall ability of the EDE to find IEDs.  State whether EDE has ability to detect other classes of chemical comp ounds or other distinguishing characteristics unique to IED beyond those cited here.   4.   Validated Test Results. Summary of vendor and / or third party certifications and / or documented results of vendor test targets, testing and test protocols (additional published technical documentation may be submitted separately). DEFINITIONS ·	Desktop EDE – Explosive Detection Equipment whose main component is transportable, but will predominantly reside and be used in the immediate vicinity (within 60 second walk) of the point of inspection.  Handheld EDE are not considered Desktop EDE. ·	Detect - to determine the presence of a distinguishing phenomenon or physical characteristic of nature. ·	Explosive Detection Equipment - devices that determine the presence of characteristics of energetics/explosive materials. ·	False Alarm Rate - the probability that an EDE classifies  the object of interest as an explosive when no explosives are present. ·	Improvised Explosive Devices - an expediently packaged explosive charge detonated by an initiator with a customized fuzing and firing circuit, also known as a bomb. ·	Objects of Interest - the subject matter of attention, for example, mail, small parcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves. ·	Performance Parameter - capabilities required for successful mission accomplishment. ·	Portal EDE – Explosive Detection Equipment that channels personnel for inspection for IEDs with explosives.  The Portal EDE will be transportable (not become a portion of the facility), but will predominantly reside and be used at the point of entry to military facilities and/or bases. ·	Point of Entry - the passageway through a protected perimeter through which all personnel, mail, cargo, and veh icles pass.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is seeking qualification statements from sources capable of continuing research and demonstration work on Locomotive Egress under emergency conditions, research and test work on Locomotive Crashworthiness and Fuel Tank Safety using models recently developed by Foster Miller, Inc., and located at their facility in Fitchburg, Massachusetts.  Foster Miller, Inc., 350 Second Avenue, Waltham, Massachusetts is currently providing these services under contract with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).  Unless another qualified source is available, it is anticipated that a “sole source” contract will be negotiated with Foster Miller, Inc, for the follow-on requirements to be performed during the years 2003 through 2008.

Follow-on requirements encompass the following areas:  Locomotive Crashworthiness Research – Tasks have been completed on the development of a LSDYNA based model of current design locomotives of the major locomotive builders.  These models are required and will be used in the proposed continuation work to evaluate the crashworthiness of these current locomotive designs using the Static Locomotive Test Facility.  This continuation will include testing of a second manufacturer’s locomotive test article.  Test articles representative of structures designed to a proposed new standard will be tested.  Using the LSDYNA based models, associated input data and results of dynamic simulations for five different accident scenarios, dynamic simulations will be used for making comparative analyses on the crash.  FRA may, at its option, add additional testing and evaluation of optimized locomotive structures.   Locomotive Egress Research – Mock ups of locomotive egress concepts have been completed and focus group surveys and feedback with locomotive engineers conducted.  The continuation tasks will utilize the mock-ups and the design ground work associated with the mock ups to design and build prototypes for full scale demonstration.  The egress hardware will be readied for field use and a training program will be developed for rescue workers.  FRA may, at its option, add additional testing and evaluation.  Locomotive Fuel Tank Safety – The tasks to be performed include an assessment of the risk of a fuel tank breach in accident situations; evaluation of current design tanks, their placement and attachment in a locomotive previously modeled for crashworthiness requires the use of finite element approaches for large displacements.  Performance of these tasks will rely upon past models which required special skills and experience.  Reliance upon previous accident simulations involving actual accidents may be required for parametric studies to be completed or extended.  Knowledge of fuel tank design and application considerations especially in regard to current proprietary designs may be needed.  Puncture resistance of alternate steels and other design parameters will be evaluated under accident situations. 



The incumbent contractor, Foster Miller, Inc., has the unique test facilities,    required for the Locomotive Crashworthiness, Locomotive Egress and Locomotive Fuel Tank Safety tasks to be performed under this proposed contract.  The facilities developed by Foster Miller under previous contracts with the FRA, and necessary to this proposed work are as follows:  The test facility required for the Locomotive Crashworthiness work is designed to accommodate a full-size locomotive front end for the applying loads of up to 1,000,000 pounds.  Foster Miller has also constructed a full-scale laboratory model mock up to obtain locomotive engineer feedback in focus groups on Locomotive Egress approaches and evaluation of the relative merits of each approach.  These facilities in Foster Miller’s possession were developed under previous Government contracts and are owned by FRA.

Interested sources must submit a fully descriptive statement of qualifications by 2:00 p.m., EST on Thursday, April 24, 2003.  Qualification statements shall be limited to no more that fifteen (15) pages.  The Qualification Statement shall include (a) a description of the facilities available to house the Government Furnished Equipment needed to perform these tasks; (b) organizational and individual knowledge and working experience with Research and demonstration work in the areas of Locomotive Crashworthiness, Locomotive Egress and Locomotive Fuel Tank Safety; and (c) names, addresses and telephone numbers for client representatives.    Resumes of key personnel who would be assigned to manage and implement the required work should be included within the 15-page limit.  Qualification statements may be submitted to the above address, fax number 202-366-6171 or e-mail to gail.boger@fra.dot.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Process Hazards Analysis and VEXDAM Modeling and Simulation
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN), Eglin AFB, FL, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under FAR 6.302-1, a firm fixed price purchase order to Technical Consultants, Inc., 107 Ashwood Terrace, Marshall, TX 75672 for a Process Hazards Analysis and VEXDAM Modeling and Simulation. It is the Air Force Research Laboratory’s belief that this requirement can only be met by Technical Consultants, Inc..  A Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) is a thorough and systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling processes and their hazards. AFRL/MN personnel with knowledge and experience with the specific process being analyzed (developing energetic and reactive materials for conventional munitions to provide dramatically improved performance) will team with the contractor representatives to conduct a PHA on the operating buildings and high explosive processing operations; including a 500 ton explosive press; located within AFRL/MN’s High Energy Research and Development Facility (HERD). VEXDAM Modeling and Simulation will also be accomplished to characterize the pressure and shock associated with varying amounts of Class 1.1 materials. The nature of the acquisition is that AFRL/MN requires a contractor to perform this effort which possesses the combination of knowledge of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, explosive manufacturing environments, process safety administration, and VEXDAM Modeling and Simulation. A final report will be developed by the contractor for the Air Force providing the results of the PHA and VEXDAM Modeling and Simulation efforts. The reference number for this acquisition is F08630-03-M-0050. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 325920. If qualified, please identify whether you are a small or large business based upon this NAICS; small business size standard: 750 employees. All responses to this notice must be written.

<SUBJECT>15 -- UMFOT System
<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Support/Commercial Derivative Aircraft Program Office is planning the acquisition of an Undergraduate Military Flight Officer Training (UMFOT) System (T-39 replacement with radar, ground based training system, and curriculum) and life cycle support, with contract award planned in fiscal year 2004.  NAVAIR is in the process of conducting market research to identify commercial products that are capable of meeting the UMFOT training objectives.  Research is specifically being held in the area of in-flight radar simulation.  Information concerning the proposed procurement, to include training objectives, mission profiles, and existing course curriculum, can be found at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/ under N00019-PMA273TXX.  NAVAIR is interested in observing demonstrations of in-flight simulated radar capabilities in order to ascertain the level of sophistication and degree of development in this field, as well as the feasibility and limitations of using this technology as an alternative to actual radar systems.  The demonstrations should show how the proposed airborne radar simulation capability can satisfy typical UMFO training requirements for air-to-ground and air-to-air radar tactical/navigation missions, with emphasis on requirements for visual correlation and the ability to account for environmental effects.  The demonstrations shall be performed at Naval Air Station, Pensacola, FL, must be conducted within thirty days from date of this announcement, and should take no longer than three hours.  The Government desires to use military aircraft stationed at the Naval Air Station for conduct this demonstration.  Therefore, when requesting an appointment for a demonstration, contractor's should detail what modifications may be needed to existing aircraft to accommodate the demonstration.  If it is not practical to use Govt. aircraft, then use of contractor aircraft is acceptable, with the understanding that the contractor should not construe this as an opportunity to provide a flight demonstration of specific aircraft. This invitation to participate in the demonstration is voluntary and does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal.  The purpose of these demonstrations is to conduct market research only, and should not be interpreted as a specific intent to purchase any of these systems nor to include a requirement for this type of system in any resulting request for proposal.  The Government will not reimburse contractors for any costs associated with the demonstrations, and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this event.  Point of Contact for information and establishing appointments is Joan Devlin, Contract Specialist, 301-757-8964 (voice), 301-757-9046 (fax), devlinjc@navair.navy.mil.

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT IS HEREBY CHANGED FROM: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) tentatively decided that operations and management of the Veterans Affairs Benefit (VBA) Property Management Services) would be contracted out. The contractor's proposal was selected to streamline and reduce the costs of the property management services rather than the government's Most Effective Organization's (MEO) proposal. The tentative decision was made after a detailed study of offerors indicated that Ocwen Federal Saving Bank, of West Palm Beach, Florida was more cost effective was determined to be the best overall value. In addition the contractor's proposal presented a proposal that was projected to yield a net savings of approximately 15 percent less for the contracted period (including option years over the government's "Most Efficient Organization"). This announcement culminates nearly two years of public-private competition using the guidelines of Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities." VA announced for A-76 study on April 27, 2001 (reference 101-09-01). The competition process established federal policy for deciding whether to retain recurring, commercial-like activities within the government, or contract them out to a private sector source. The guidance tells how to compare performance and cost related information to arrive at the best overall value for the taxpayer. Following this tentative award decision announcement is a twenty-day period for appeal, protest and review of documents, which will require a minimum of thirty-days before a final award decision is made. After a final award decision has been made an final announcement will be posted to inform the public of the official awardee. PLEASE DIRECT ALL QUESTION PERTAINING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER: jessica.thrasher-wilson@mail.va.gov or 202-345-3311.

SECTION C:  White Paper Preparation Instructions

1.  General Instructions:  

a.  Offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision of FAR 52.215-1(e) Instructions to Offerors--Competitive Acquisition. Offerors should consider proposal instructions contained in the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry, which can be accessed on line at www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract. This guide was specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the PRDA/BAA proposal process. White Papers must be valid for 60 days and must reference the above announcement number.  Offerors must submit one original and three (3) copies of their White Papers.  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the government.  The cost of preparing White Papers in response to this PRDA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting or any other contract; however, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.

2.  White Papers:  		

a.  Page Limitation: 5 pages per advanced demonstrator (total of 15 pages), 10 pitch or larger, double spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches.  This limitation includes all information, e.g., indices, photographs, foldouts, appendices, attachments, etc.  It does not apply to the offeror’s proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW), which is limited to 6 pages (2 pages per demonstrator). The government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation. 

	b.  The White Papers shall include a discussion of the nature and scope of the technical approach.  As a separate Volume, which will be in addition to the White Paper page limitation, provide additional information on prior work in this area, descriptions of available equipment, data and facilities and resumes of personnel who will be participating in this effort.  This volume shall include a CSOW detailing the technical tasks proposed to be accomplished under the proposed effort and suitable for contract incorporation and a 1-page Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of cost.  Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry referenced above to assist in SOW preparation. 

         c.  The evaluation of the White Papers shall consider technical aspects and cost factors as they relate to each demonstrator effort.  The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the relative merit of the technical approach proposed for each demonstrator in response to the announcement. The technical aspect ranks as the first order of priority and it shall be evaluated on the following criteria which are equal in order of importance:
 	  
(1)   (50%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor's Statement of Work (CSOW).    Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        
(2)   (50%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated. 
d. Any questions concerning the technical White Papers or SOW preparation shall be referred to the Contracting POC  cited above. 

SECTION D: Basis for Award:  This section shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror’s proposal (both technical oral presentation and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. While cost is a significant factor, the technical aspect, is ranked as the first order of priority and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are of descending importance:
      
1.  Technical:  

a.  (40%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW).  Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        

b.  (40%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated.  

c.  (20%) The offeror’s past experience with the technology, including personnel and related manufacturing facilities.
    
2.  Cost/Business Proposal:  This paragraph shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

          a.  COST/PRICE:  Separate the proposal into a business section and cost section. Adequate price competition is anticipated.  The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contractual or instrument arrangements, such as type of contract/instrument, any exceptions to terms and conditions of the model contract, any information not technically related, etc.  Provide rationale for exceptions. Cost proposals have no limitations; however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 10 pages as a goal.  The proposal shall be furnished with supporting schedules and shall contain a person-hour breakdown per task.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry for detailed proposal instructions.  Offerors should provide a separate cost proposal for each advanced demonstrator and an overall cost proposal for the entire effort, if desired.  Offerors are reminded the effort has a 50:50 cost share approach.  The offeror should clearly show what portions of the effort will be funded by the Government and what portions will be funded by the offeror.  

b.  Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the second order of priority.  .  

c.  Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk will be individually assessed for the technical (oral presentation), cost and schedule areas. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. 

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The oral and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award of a contract or assistance instrument any, all, part or none of the proposal received.  Award of a grant to universities or nonprofit institutions, or assistance instrument in lieu of a contract will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties. The government also reserves the right to award any resulting contract pursuant to the Research and Development Standard Contract format in DFARS 235.70. 


SECTION E: OTHER INFORMATION TO OFFERORS:

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
