The Naval Sea Systems Command plans to award a Basic Ordering Agreement, on an other than full and open competition basis, to General DynamicsBath Iron Works (GD-BIW), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to perform post-delivery engineering and management efforts in support of the LCS 2 and LCS 4.
  Efforts shall include execution and advance planning of Continuous Maintenance Availabilities (CMAV), Continuous Maintenance (CM), Emergent Maintenance (EM), Planned Maintenance System (PMS) Planning and Execution, Facilities Maintenance (FM), Administration and Engineering Support Services (AESS), class planning and support services, and Oversight and Integration (O&I) efforts.  This basic ordering agreement will bridge the gap between interim support services, currently being performed under contracts N00024-03-C-2310 and N00024-09-C-2302, and the competitive award of a Product Support Plan (PSP) contract.  As the shipbuilder of the LCS 2 and LCS 4, GD-BIW is the only known source with extensive previous experience necessary to perform these efforts and has developed unique and technical expertise for the design, engineering, construction, and maintenance of these ships.
  GD-BIW is the only known source capable of providing coverage in order to prevent possible disruption in services and unacceptable delays in mission critical efforts necessary to restore or maintain the ship to a fully operational level required to support the Fleet.

The statutory authority for the sole source is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>1.) SYNOPSIS:  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  The proposed services, which will be obtained by negotiated Firm Fixed Price Contracts, are for a variety of Architect/Engineer services primarily for Army Reserve projects nationwide (including Puerto Rico) and military projects within the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division mission boundaries.  Projects outside the primary mission area may be added at the Government's discretion upon agreement of the A/E firm.   <br>  <br> Projects will be awarded by individual task orders. The maximum cumulative contract value for the total contract is $9,000,000.  This is a five year contract, with no option years.  The estimated construction cost per project is between approximately $3,000,000 and $50,000,000.   <br>  <br> Up to four firms will be selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second, and so on.  Award of all contracts will be made within nine (9) months after award of the first contract provided there is sufficient workload.  If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between firms considered as technically equal.  The following factors will be used in deciding which offeror will be selected to negotiate task orders: performance, quality of deliverables, capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, and uniquely specialized experience.  Significant emphasis will be placed on the A/E's quality control procedures, as the district will perform the quality assurance role only.  Estimated start date is July 2013.   <br>  <br> If a large business is selected to negotiate a contract, the firm will be required to present an acceptable Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507 prior to award of the contract.  The current subcontracting goals are 50.0 percent to Small Business, 18.0 percent to Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), 17.0 percent to Small Disadvantaged Business, 4.0 percent to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 10.0 percent to HUB Zone Small Business, and 4.0 percent to Veteran Owned Small Business.  These percentages are applied to the total amount of subcontracted dollars.   <br>  <br> The Louisville District and the U.S. Army Reserve plan to partner this program.  The selected firms and relevant subconsultants will be required to attend annual two-day partnering workshops for all architecture, engineering and interior design disciplines to define the Government's expectations of the A/E, create a positive working atmosphere, encourage open communication, and to identify common goals.  Cost for these sessions will be borne by the selected A/E.   <br>  <br> In accordance with FAR 36.604 and the supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, all task orders above $30,000 will receive a performance evaluation.  A performance evaluation may be prepared for lesser task orders and interim performance evaluations may be prepared at any time.  Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for Architect-Engineer Services.   <br>  <br> 2.) PROJECT SPECIFIC INFORMATION:  The selected firm will be solely responsible for the designs that they produce, and will become the designer of record for each individual project on their contract.  Projects may consist of military projects for the U.S. Army Reserve and other military customers of USACE Louisville District.

<DESC> <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a solicitation set aside for certified small business contractors for the repair of the wharf located along the east side of the Block Island Harbor, Block Island, Rhode Island.  The NAICS code for the work described below is 237990, size standard of $33.5M.  The project is planned to be issued in April 2013 as a Small Business Lowest Bid award. The construction will begin after the summer tourist season, and extend over one-two months.  Cost will be in $100,000 to $200,000 range.  Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a bid to be considered by the New England District. <br>  <br> The work of this project involves repairing a wharf damaged by the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy.  The wharf is located on the eastern side of the inner basin of old harbor on Block Island, Rhode Island, and is in front of Ballard's Inn.  Numerous inboard pile caps have become elevated above the tops of the inboard timber piles.  The work involves removing some of the 4 quote mark  x 10 quote mark  deck planks and timber wheel guards in order to provide access to the pile caps.  Sand and rip rap will need to be excavated or moved around each of the inboard piles in order to provide the room necessary to reseat the pile caps on top of the piles.  Once the pile caps are reseated on the inboard piles, steel straps (two per pile) will be installed at each pile, including the outboard piles.  No excavation is necessary at the outboard piles.  After the pile caps have been reseated and the straps installed, the existing timber decking and timber wheel guards shall be reinstalled using existing hardware.  In addition, the inboard fascia board shall be replaced in-kind and two ladders on the outboard face of the wharf shall be replaced. <br>  <br> The work of the project requires construction operations immediately adjacent to a busy public restaurant.  Barricades and chain link safety fencing shall be installed in this location to separate the general public from the active construction areas of the project.  The barricades and safety fencing shall be installed prior to the start of all other onsite activities.  The Contractor shall modify and implement other construction methods as necessary to ensure the safety of the public in this area. <br>  <br> Please note this solicitation is set aside for certified small businesses under the applicable NAICS code 237990, size standard of $33.5M. This is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about April 16, 2013.  Neither telephonic, mailed, nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted.

<a href="mailto:pamela.e.penaherrera.civ@mail.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the U.S Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), is currently seeking sources for a multi-plane imaging system for use in a standard indoor ballistic range test environment. The system shall be capable of providing multiple (3 or more), near instantaneous (less than 1 minute of processing time), pairs of 3-dimensional measurements of a small (possibly less than 5mm per dimensional axis), rotating (1 full rotation per 7 inches of travel), flying (translational velocity of 3000 ft/sec or more) projectile in free flight. The fidelity of the three or more measurements of: position, translational velocity, and three dimensional orientation shall be comparable or superior to current X-ray alternatives with sub tenths (or better) of a degree angular precision (both planes) at designated measurement points relative to fixed orthogonal planes being optimal.  <br>  <br> The precision of the system to dynamically capture and report three dimensional, near instant, clear estimates of projectile orientation and position during standard rotating flight in a cost effective, precise way is a primary consideration. Captured images of the projectile along its principle axis (about an inch) while in flight shall be of sufficient pixel density. A spatial resolution of 500 pixels/inch (or greater) for a test measuring angle of attack of a rifle bullet in standard rotational flight is desired. This assumes an overall resolution of 1360 X 1024 with a 2.75 quote mark  field of view. <br>  <br> Precision camera operation and light source emission control is essential as the system must be able to coordinate, extract, and process multiple sets of orthogonal images to generate velocity and orientation measurements of the projectile in dynamic rotating flight.      <br>  <br> The system shall also not be overly restrictive in terms of the accuracy of the projectile's flight path with normal small caliber ballistic dispersion expectations (e.g. M-4 dispersion) not being an impediment to either use or safe and continued operation of the device or system during routine day to day testing. <br>  <br> The system is intended for extended rapid tests. Therefore, the system shall not utilize one shot components (e.g. some strobes) and shall have a minimal cost to use; time to use; experience to use; and safe-to-use footprints that would enable and promote broad usage of the system. <br>  <br> Set up time of the system and tools required for set up are a consideration with fewer tools and less time being more optimal. Note: portability is not a requirement, but the system should easily fit in standard indoor range.  <br>  <br> Measurements made by the system shall be directly exportable through conventional computer mediums (e.g. excel) for additional off range analysis work. Compatibility and suitability of data collected for use with techniques and processes of other Government agencies and laboratories (such as that utilized by Aberdeen Proving Grounds) is a consideration as standardized testing is advantageous to progress. A GigE interface (or better) for image transfer post test is desirable. <br>  <br>  <br> Firms/companies are invited to indicate their capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, demonstration video, etc. and provide information of previous experience related to this type of work.  The information provided will not be returned. All data should be sent at no cost to the US Government NO LATER THAN March 12, 2013 to the US Army ARDEC. ATTN: Pamela Penaherrera Bldg 09 Picatinny, NJ 07866-5000, email: pamela.e.penaherrera.civ@mail.mil. In addition, please provide the firm's name and address, point of contact with telephone number and email address, and size of business (small/large).  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The Government will accept written questions by email. This is a market survey to be used for informational planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is the Government obligated to issue an RFP. The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>5. Number of years in business</p>
<p>6. Indicate if your company is capable of performing all draft SOW requirements with in-house resources or if it would need to partner with or subcontract to other company(s). If you envision partnering/subcontracting, identify the specific requirements or areas, and (if known) your likely partner(s)/subcontractor(s)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draft Statement of Work (SOW)</span></p>
<p>To ensure the draft SOW is clear, commercially reasonable, and attainable, FHFA requests respondents review the attached draft SOW and:</p>
<p>1. Provide feedback on SOW sections that are unclear or challenging. Describe what is unclear and/or why it is a challenge. Propose viable potential alternatives to achieve FHFA's desired results.</p>

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the products/services stated herein. All businesses, large and small businesses (8(a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>The mission of the Sensor Science Division is to develop and provide national measurement standards and services to advance physical science and technology in optical radiation, temperature, pressure, vacuum, flow, and related physical phenomena.</p>
<p>Strategic Goals of the Sensor Science Division:</p>
<p>1. Advance, maintain, and disseminate standards for the kelvin (unit of temperature) and candela (unit of luminous intensity) SI base units and for various optical, humidity, pressure, vacuum and flow quantities.<br />2. Advance applications of optical, temperature, humidity, pressure, vacuum and flow measurements and sensors in technology areas of national importance, including climate-change research, environmental monitoring, greenhouse gas measurement, defense and homeland security, lighting, astronomy, and health and safety.<br />3. Build and maintain state-of-the-art measurement infrastructure to meet the emerging optical power, temperature, humidity, pressure, vacuum, flow and related measurement needs of industry, government, and academia.<br />4. Support international efforts through the Consultative Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR), for Thermometry (CCT), and for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM), including participating in appropriate measurement comparisons designed to secure the worldwide acceptance of US products and practices that are reliant upon NIST measurements.<br />The NIST Sensor Science Division maintains a transfer standard cryogenic vacuum infrared radiometer know as the MDXR which is calibrated at NIST and shipped to user facilities to transfer the NIST low background infrared irradiance scale to customer space simulation chambers. These chambers are manufactured by ATK Corporation.  In particular, several ATK Model LSPS 16a infrared test chambers are used by a major NIST customer.</p>
<p>NIST requires method for attaching the MDXR to these chambers, all manufactured by ATK Corporation, that will provide a 100 percent compatible configuration to transfer, transport, and maintain compatibility to the ATK systems. NIST maintains a conceptual design for a cart that can hold the MDXR during shipping to the customer site, and allow it roll onto the laboratory floor, and provide a separable truck which will enable the MDXR to roll onto the ATK rail system and mate with an LSPS 16a chamber. NIST does not have access to the ATK Corporation proprietary designs of the ATK rail system.</p>
<p>Sources that have the ability to provide this instrument are asked to respond to this notice with a corporate capability statement of a maximum of ten (10) pages to provide a clear and complete narrative of current capabilities to meet the requirements as detailed above. Those sources are requested to respond to this notice and in so doing, provide the following information: organization information to include company name and address, size and socio-economic status of business as it relates to NAICS code 334511 (Small Business size standard of 500 employees), current point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), list of current GSA federal supply schedules (if applicable) under which your company can provide the products described in this notice, and a list of contracts within the past three (3) years in which a similar instrument was provided.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>All responses shall be emailed to Lynda.Roark@nist.gov so that they are received no later than 5:00 pm EST March 11, 2013.</p>

The gap in the cutoff wall extends approximately 302 feet.  The Capitol City Freeway crosses the levee in the north-south direction through the middle of the gap. Using jet grouting, the soil cement cutoff walls will be extended toward the Capitol City Freeway but not completely across the Freeway. The cutoff wall would be installed to within 10 feet of the edge of both sides of Capitol City Freeway...approximately 67 feet on the upstream side of the freeway and approximately 78 feet on the downstream side. Extending the cutoff wall from the existing limits to within 10 feet of the edge of pavement would capture seepage in this area. <br>  <br> Site L10 is located on the left/south bank of the American River at Howe Avenue. A soil-cement cutoff wall will be installed under the Howe Avenue Bridge on/near existing bike trail on the waterside of the levee. The new cutoff wall will be installed using jet grouting and will pass under the bridge, then ascend the levee on both sides of the bridge to a terminal point with the existing cutoff. A low permeability soil blanket will be installed on the waterside slope and connecting with the new cutoff wall. Finally, the existing riprap slope protection will be removed and replaced after construction on the waterside slope under the bridges to prevent erosion. An approximately 175-foot section of the existing levee upstream of Howe Avenue will be raised in place to provide required flood protection.   <br>  <br> The Contractor shall use a triple-fluid jet grouting system for constructing cutoff walls at both sites.  The Contractor shall also be able to jet grout around existing utilities, to be protected in place. <br>  <br> Small businesses are reminded under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines 52.219-14, the concern will perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees. <br> Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under this sources sought synopsis. <br>  <br> Firm's response to this Synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages and shall include the following information: <br> Interested contractors must submit the following in response to this announcement:  <br>  <br> 1.  Firm's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address. <br> 2.  Firm's interest in bidding on the solicitation when it is issued. <br> 3.  Firm's capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity (include firm's capability to execute construction, comparable work performed within the past 5 years: <br> 	Brief description of the project, customer name, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, and dollar value of the project) - provide at least 3 examples. <br> 4.  Firm's Business Size - LB, SB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB. <br> 6.  Firm's Joint Ventures (existing), including Mentor Prot g s and teaming arrangement information is acceptable <br> 7.

<DESC>Purpose: The purpose of this notice is to&nbsp;invite interested roofing contractors&nbsp;to a Pre-Proposal Conference in conjunction with the anticipated&nbsp;release of&nbsp;the draft Request For Proposal (dRFP).<br /><br />The Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is transforming the way the U.S. Air Force purchases its roofing repair and replacement needs. The ESG will move the Air Force to a regional contract model representing approximately $325 million in total roofing requirements over five years. This will represent a significant change in roofing acquisition for both the Air Force and roofing contractors.
<p>As part of an ongoing effort to more efficiently procure roofing for the Air Force, the ESG is preparing to solicit a targeted number of&nbsp;multiple award, regional indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ)-type contracts covering Air Force bases located in the contiguous U.S. This approach is a transformational shift from traditional base-specific contracts to a more strategic approach designed to address ongoing budget and manpower challenges. <br /><br />In conjunction with anticipated release of the draft Request for Proposal, the ESG will be hosting a Pre-Proposal Conference at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH to communicate the preliminary contract requirements that will be contained in the&nbsp; dRFP and to obtain input from interested roofing contractors. There will be no conference fee to participate. Proposed discussion topics for the event include:</p>
<p>&bull; Overview of Strategic Sourcing<br />&bull; Role of Small Business and Teaming Arrangements<br />&bull; Overview of the Air Force Roofing Strategy &amp; Objectives<br />&bull; Review of the draft RFP<br /><br />Interested contractors are invited to attend to learn about this upcoming business opportunity and provide feedback to the Air Force. Additionally, this event will provide an opportunity for contractors to network with potential teaming partners and/or subcontractors.<br /><br />It is the intention of the ESG to&nbsp;release the dRFP&nbsp;by the end of March 2013 which will be posted to FBO as a modification to this Special Notice.</p>
<p>Details of the Pre-Proposal Conference are as follows:</p>
<p>Date: Wednesday, 17 April 2013<br />Duration: 1 Day (approximately 8am-5pm EST)<br />Location: Kenney Hall, Air Force Institute of Technology, Area B, Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, OH</p>
<p>Please note that the date and location may be subject to change in the event of Sequestration or other unforeseen delays, and the Government cannot be held liable for any costs incurred by you or your company should there be any unforeseen changes to the event. Attendance at the Pre-Proposal Conference, while encouraged, is completely voluntary.</p>
<p>Registration:<br />Attendees should register by clicking on the link below. Please note that identifying information will be required to register, so we advise waiting to&nbsp;register until all company attendees are finalized.</p>
<p>https://einvitations.afit.edu/inv/anim.cfm?i=140153&amp;k=36542087E54</p>

<SUBJECT>--Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant Deactivation Services
<SOLNBR>DE-SOL-0004563
<CONTACT>Kimberly A. Tate
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is planning for the return of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) facilities that are currently being leased by the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC), a private company.  DOE anticipates soliciting services for deactivation activities of the PGDP under the DOE Environmental Management Nationwide Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) - Unrestricted Contracts for Environmental Remediation Services, Deactivation, Decommissioning, Demolition, and Removal (DD&R) Services of Facilities (Contaminated), Waste Management Services, and Regulatory Services that were awarded December 16, 2010, to allow for a Contractor to be in place when United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) returns the facilities to DOE. 	 The Paducah DOE Site is located on a Federal reservation in Western Kentucky, approximately 10 miles west of Paducah, Kentucky, and 3.5 miles south of the Ohio River.  Situated on 3,553 acres, the PGDP is a Government-owned uranium enrichment plant that was constructed in the early 1950?s and operated by the DOE and its predecessor agencies for the purpose of manufacturing enriched uranium for the fabrication of fuel assemblies to support commercial and military nuclear reactors and to support weapons development activities.  Enrichment operations at the plant are currently conducted by USEC.  USEC leases all enrichment process-related buildings from DOE, as well as the Administration Building, the Guard and Fire Headquarters, the Equipment Cleaning Building, the Technical Services Building, and the Maintenance and Stores Building.  USEC uranium enrichment activities are conducted under a certificate issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  The PGDP includes Hazard  Category 2 Nuclear Facilities based on the uranium inventory.  For more information regarding the site, you may visit the website at:  http://www.pppo.energy.gov/paducah.html.
This opportunity will only be open to DOE EM ID/IQ Unrestricted Contractors.  For more information regarding the EM ID/IQ Contracts, you may visit the website at: http://www.emcbc.doe.gov/EM%20Nationwide%20IDIQ%20(COP)/index.php.  It is expected that a draft Request for Task Proposals may be released within the next 60 days.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration, intends to make a sole source award to CDI for iCell Cardiomyoctes. The iCell Cardiomyoctes from CDI are needed for data consistency, since preliminary tobacco cytotoxicity data has been generated from CDI pluripotent-stem cell derived cardiomyocytes from previous purchase (HHSF223201210181A). In the follow-up study, the FDA needs to use the same source of pluripotent-stem cell derived cardiomyocytes. Because this study will analyze the gene expression changes, changing the source of cardiomyocytes will cause significant noise for the final data analysis. <br /><br />The iCell&reg; Cardiomyocytes must be highly purified human cardiomyocytes derived from iPS cells through proprietary differentiation and purification protocols. The cells must express monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) and/or blasticidin resistance, both of which are under the control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain (Myh6) promoter. The iCell Cardiomyocytes must be purified through antibiotic resistance under control of the Myh6 promotor such that the population of cells is greater than 95% cardiomyocytes as defined by cardiac troponin T staining or mRFP expression. iCell Cardiomyocytes must be a mixture of spontaneously electrically active atrial, nodal, and ventricular-like myocytes that possess typical electrophysiological characteristics and exhibit expected electrophysiological and biochemical responses upon exposure to exogenous agents. The cells must be a reliable source of human cardiomyocytes suitable for use in targeted drug discovery, toxicity testing, and other life science research. Each unit of the iCell Cardiomyocytes must contain at least 1.5 million plateable cardiomyoctes and orders must be able to be fulfilled in a single delivery upon request.<br /><br />The NAICS Code is 541711. This procurement is made under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1) - only one responsible source. This is a notice of intent to issue this solicitation on a sole source basis. This notice of intent is not a solicitation for competitive proposals. Any other firms desiring consideration must fully identify their interest and capability to provide this item, or submit a proposal within 15 days to the individual listed. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The projected award date is on or about March 15, 2013.<br />

<DESC><p>The Forest Service intends to award a HUBZone sole source contract to Roadtech Inc. under Negotiated Procedures for the purchase of a mobile rock crusher. This requirement is proposed to be a sole source procurement to a certified HUBZone company under the authority of the HUBZone Act of 1997 (15 U.S.C. 631 note) and FAR 19.1302. Justification for such procedures: This type of machine is less expensive to operate, recycles previously unsuitable material on site thereby eliminating disposal problems, can operate on small single lane roads, minimizes material handling and hauling costs, has low environmental impacts, and has the capability of blending soil stabilizers or dust abatement products into the road material. This method not only completely eliminates the costly removal and replacement of the material to be crushed, but can re-establish a native roadbed without spreading seeds and/or diseases from Forest to Forest. This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive proposals. If there are businesses that can provide the aforementioned product, and meet the minimum requirements listed below, they must respond by submitting in writing an expression of interest in competing on the procurement and provide supporting documentation as to how their proposed product meets the stated minimum requirements by August 1, 2008 at 3:00 p.m. MST. The mobile rock crusher must meet the following minimum requirements: The mobile rock crusher shall be capable of taking oversized rock that has been windrowed along the roadway and crush it as the machine progresses down the road. Operating sites may vary from steep, narrow mountain roads to developed pit sites. The machine shall be capable of blending all types of material, regardless of shape or hardness. Machine shall be capable of crushing rocks up to 16" to an aggregate graduation of &frac34;" minus. Mobile rock crusher shall be built to a size that does NOT require any oversize or overweight permits when being transported on State, County, or Federal Highway; crusher shall have adjustment capability of hammers and anvils to adjust for wear to increase the consistency of the aggregate produced; equipment shall be designed with a multi-position lift frame which allows the crusher head to be rotated so crews may work with the underside of the machine facing them at working level to increase safety; the crusher shall have shock protection to reduce vibration; have a removable anvil weldment for ease of service and repair, and the crusher shall have radial attachment of the tooling, which results in much easier and faster replacement of wear parts. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) intends to negotiate a sole source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, with The Boeing Company, 5301 Bolsa Ave., Huntington Beach, CA 92647 to deliver Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) panels and associated hardware in support of the planned testing of a large-scale test article representing the center portion of a Hybrid Wing Body (HWB) vehicle.  This project represents 20 years of effort and a level of expertise that requires proprietary tooling equipment unique to Boeing Research and Technology (R&T) and manufacturing methodologies used and developed under numerous LaRC contracts.  NASA LaRC believes Boeing R&T is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement for this particular system, as it is the only contractor with experience in stitched structure that is capable of providing the design and manufacturing of the required PRSEUS panels.  Because the PRSEUS panels are an integral part of the overall design concept of the large-scale test article, Boeing R&T is the only company capable of delivering the panels to meet project needs. The proposed action is for the procurement of PRSEUS panels which will be delivered 3 months from the receipt of contract award.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required PRSEUS panels and associated hardware should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive response; however, any responses received by the Government will be evaluated within 30 days of publication of this synopsis. A determination to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.  Submit response to the NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Octavia L. Hicks (B-104), Research & Development Services Branch, 5 Langley Blvd., Bldg. 2101, M/S 12, Hampton, VA 23666 or email to octavia.l.hicks@nasa.gov.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<RESPDATE>031313
<CONTACT>Adrienne Y. Bell, Email bellam@state.gov
<DESC>-REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e).</p>
<p>Description: <br />Department of State (DoS), Bureau of Human Resources (HR) is performing market research to determine industry interest and capabilities in providing a program by which overseas embassies can use web-based, automated, pre-employment skills test for LE staff recruitment worldwide. This is a Request for Information (RFI) announcement only. This is not a solicitation or request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submissions of this RFI nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement. This RFI is solely intended for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Responses to this notice will not be considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for expenses associated with this RFI. Respondents will not be briefed on the Government's review of submissions to this RFI.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Office of Overseas Employment (OE) works with the nearly 200 United States embassies and consulates around the globe to hire and employ approximately 53,000 USG Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) and other overseas employees. These employees are an integral part of the diplomatic team dedicated to representing America's interests to other countries. They provide the institutional knowledge and professional contacts that are so important to the embassy. Because FSN personnel perform vital mission program and support functions and all USG agencies under Chief of Mission (COM) authority depend heavily on them to perform oftentimes significant management roles and program functions, the recruitment process at our posts must be of the highest caliber. Pre-employment testing is one of the elements that ensure we are recruiting the best and the brightest.</p>
<p><br />Department of State Needs:<br />Each HR office at the approximately 200 US Missions abroad processes hundreds of job applications for each posted vacancy announcement. In an effort to regularize and expedite recruitment at post, HR/OE seeks to offer our overseas Missions universal pre-employment job skills testing for assessing in-country job applicants. HR/OE's informal survey of posts regarding pre-employment skills tests showed testing inconsistencies worldwide and established the need for standardized skills tests. Previous piloting of non-automated English Testing has proven that pre-employment testing expedites the employment process.</p>
<p>Technical Requirement:<br />At a minimum:</p>
<p>1. An online menu or online catalogue of validated, automated skills level testing available 24/7 via the internet. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The online menu or online catalogue should also define the various proficiency levels of each test.</span> The online menu or catalogue should include skills tests in the following areas:<br />a. Microsoft Applications - Word, Excel, PowerPoint<br />b. Math and Basic Accounting for office administration<br />c. English speaking, reading, writing and translating</p>
<p>2. Establish and operate a recruitment testing program for overseas posts.<br />3. Provide the Missions with easy online access to an unlimited number of required tests for testing purposes.<br />4. The tests must be easily accessible by applicants via the internet.<br />5. The test results must be reliable and provided to overseas posts quickly. <br />6. The vendor must provide a minimum of technical support to the embassies and Department administrators.<br />7. The vendor will provide some "in-house" branding/customization of the selected test packet. <br />8. The vendor will provide two price lists: a) for per-test purchase by posts and, b) an enterprise-wide license for unlimited testing by the Department of State at all overseas posts.</p>
<p><br />Market Reserach (Capability Statement):<br />The following are instructions for vendor's response to this RFI</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>1. Provide a detailed capability statement, focusing on your firm's proven ability to provide the requirement and not exceed ten (10) pages including cover pages, table of contents etc. The detailed capability statement should include the minimum requirements identified under technical requirements above.<br />2. Provide company and contact information<br />3. Sale brochures, videos, and other marketing information materials are not solicited and will not be reviewed.<br />4. Provide price information <br />5. Identification of the available contract vehicles which the test and supporting labor can be purchased through, such as: GSA Federal Supply Schedules (schedule/contract number and appropriate Special Item Numbers) or other GWAC vehicles by agency and contract number. <br />6. Provide the size classification of your business. If you are classified as a small business, HUBZone small business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business, Woman-owned small business and/or 8(a) certified small business, <br />7. Interested companies shall submit an electronic copy of their response (along with supporting documentation) via email to Adrienne Bell at bellam@state.gov The due date and time for submission of responses is 3:00 pm EST March 13, 2013.. <br />8. No phone calls related to this RFI will be accepted. All correspondence shall be sent via email only.</p>
<p><br />Disclaimer <br />This RFI is not an offer. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked "Proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses.. This announcement is Government market research and may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associates with responding to this RFI.</p>

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Negotiate and Award a Short-Term Sole Source Contract Extension with Federal Consulting Inc. for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Analyst Support Services to Ensure Continuity of Services Pending Completion of a Competitive Acquision
<SOLNBR>OIS-13-153
<RESPDATE>031313
<CONTACT>Carol Greenwood, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-492-3694, Fax 301-492-3438, Email Carol.Greenwood@nrc.gov - Michael D. Turner, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 492-3632, Fax (301) 492-3437, Email michael.turner@nrc.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Office of Administration, Division of Contracts intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract extension to Contract No. NRC-33-08-389 with Federal Consulting, Inc., (FCI) for continuation of highly important Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Analyst Support Services.</p>
<p>The NRC's Office of Information Services, Information and Records Services Division, Information Services Branch has primary responsibility for the reviewed fulfillment of all FOIA requests submitted to the agency. The proposed extension will maintain continuity of FOIA analyst support services preceding the award of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>Presently, the aforementioned services are being provided to NRC by FCI under NRC Contract No. NRC-33-08-389 which expires on March 31, 2013. Proposals received for the competitive follow-on acquisition to that contract are currently under evaluation by NRC; however, because of a number of factors that have significantly complicated the evaluation of proposals, award of a contract resulting from that solicitation cannot be made before the current contract expires.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the contract extension will be three (3) months, starting on April 1, 2013, through June 30, 2013, plus one three-month option to extend the term of the contract if that should become necessary, starting on July 1, 2013, through September 30, 2013.</p>
<p>FCI has the necessary knowledge, experience, and staff to maintain services currently being performed under NRC-33-08-389 while the competitive follow-on acquisition is completed and awaded. FCI is the only source that can seamlessly perform those requirements while NRC completes its evaluation and award process for the follow-on acquisition. It is not feasible to award a new contract to provide the required support between now and award of the follow-on contract for the following reasons:</p>
<p>- A new contractor would require several months to be able to comply with NRC Security standards.</p>
<p>- It would not be cost effective for the NRC to negotiate and award a short-term contract with any source besides FCI. If NRC were to do so, NRC would incur thousands of dollars in transition costs and those costs may very well have to be incurred yet again after the award of the follow-on contract. That duplication of costs could not be recovered by NRC through competition or any other means.<br /><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this contract extension is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition in those situations where only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>No source other than the incumbent can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required, and conducting a follow-on acquisition for this need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>For the reasons noted above, NRC intends to award the short-term contract extension to FCI to ensure that NRC is able to meet its mission without any lapse in services while it completes the competitive process for the follow-on acquisition.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Tinker AFB has a need for the establishment of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with local hotels to obtain lodging accommodations and services for Tinker Air Force Base, OK on a rental basis. A BPA is a simplified method of filling anticipated needs for services and is designed to reduce administrative costs by eliminating the need for issuing individual purchase orders. The BPA identifies the individuals designated as guests who are eligible to occupy either single or double occupancy hotel or motel rooms. These individuals will pay the hotel direct. Tinker AFB intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) from this combined synopsis/solicitation utilizing full and open competition. As needed, these services will be acquired by placing calls against a BPA. The Contractor is responsible for providing the lodging service and accomodations under each BPA for the personnel on active duty with the 507th ARW, for Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekends only Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Contractor will hold and guarantee the room until 0600 hours the following morning. The 507th office will provide the contractor a list of names of these members and date of arrival. Contractor will in turn supply confirmation numbers for those personnel listed on the provided list.The total ordering capacity under each BPA shall not exceed $5,000,000.00 and no call issued under any of the BPAs shall exceed $25,000.00. Each BPA shall be valid for a period of five years or when the total dollar amount of all calls issued under the BPA reaches $5,000,000.00, whichever comes first. Offerors submitting prices should refer to Price List under "Additional documentation" . Subsequently, prices will be updated annually (fiscal year) and remain good for a period of one year. Prices are to be submitted to Douglas Cornelius at douglas.cornelius@tinker.af.mil by 4:00 PM CST, 28 Ferbruary 2012. However all responsible sources may submit prices after close date of this notice, which will be considered by the agency for addition to the BPA.

This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly? (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <BR> <BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that?

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror?s TIN.

A foreign entity that is treated as an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code at 26 U.S.C. 7874 (or would be except that the inversion transactions were completed on or before March 4, 2003), is also an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of 6 U.S.C. 395 and for this solicitation provision (see FAR 9.108).

End of Provision <BR> <BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> Synopsis: <br> 1.	CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract(s) is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide for the primary disciplines of Structural, Civil, Geotechnical, Hydraulic and Hydrologic, Mechanical, and Electrical engineering (each of equal priority); additional disciplines are Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Cost Engineering, Surveying, Cartography, and Specification Writing. It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded by July 2013. This announcement may result in up to four (4) awards and is restricted to Small Business firms.  If concurrent multiple contract awards are made, task orders will be allocated based upon the Contracting Officer's determination of performance; the special qualifications of the firms; the nature of the work involved in the task order; the capacity of the firms to accomplish the work in the required time; and knowledge of the region.  In the final selection process, the most highly qualified firms may be interviewed.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330 and the Small Business size standard is $14 million in average annual receipts. The period for this contract is five (5) years for a total IDIQ value not to exceed $9,000,000 per contract.   Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. Work will be ordered by firm-fixed price task orders. The District intends to award two (2) IDIQ contracts, and may award two (2) additional contracts from this announcement.  The top ranked firm in the SF 330 evaluation will be requested to provide a firm fixed price proposal and may be awarded the first contract, if negotiations are completed; the second ranked firm to negotiate may be awarded the second contract, and so on. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tie breaker between firms considered as technically equal. The Contracting Officer will consider the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate in order:  past performance; the special qualifications of the firms; the nature of the work involved in the task order; the capacity of the firms to accomplish the work in the required time; and knowledge of the region.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act as determined by the employee's office location (not the location of the work).  Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract at the time of the original award and will become effective on the anniversary of the contract award date.   <br>  <br> 2.

<p>(6) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(7) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a <br />Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an MLCA 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(8) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:</p>
<p>Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Security<br />Transportation/Drivers Contract Administration<br />Quality Assurance Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each contract line item/CLIN as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule of Supplies/Services as follows:</p>

Future invoices for that item/CLIN have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing.

Therefore, to facilitate payment, the DUNS number shall be recorded on every invoice submitted to the US Coast Guard.</p>
<p>All payments for partial performance rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend progress payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subsequent agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified by the designated billing office and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) as accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration.</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: "THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER (To be assigned upon contract award).</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, DC (INL/RM)<br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:<br />This position is located in the Office of Resource Management, Bureau of International Narcotics, and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL/RM). The Bureau has overall responsibility for the development, supervision, and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and on international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. The Foreign Service Assignments Officer will perform duties in both domestic and foreign assignments, as needed, to supplement existing staff during times of heavy workload, when staff shortages occur, or when expertise is required for specific projects.</p>
<p>Relationship: <br />The Officer receives administrative direction from the Administrative Officer, but acts with a high degree of independence in planning, scheduling, and completing work, within the framework of delegated authority. Many assignments are self-initiated based on the Officer's assessment of post requirements and the means to meet them. As the primary liaison with post personnel and host nation officials, the Officer has broad latitude in coordinating work efforts and plays a key role in ensuring that posts operate effectively and in compliance with relevant regulations.</p>
<p>The Officer uses a high degree of expertise and independent judgment in developing, consulting, coordinating, and executing programs to achieve compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and organizational goals and objectives, and resolves all but the most complex and sensitive issues. Recommendations and decisions are assumed technically accurate, and work is reviewed in terms of the overall effectiveness of the efforts by management within the Division as well as post officials and staff who rely on the Officer's advice and support.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities: <br />&bull; Manages the Foreign Service Assignments process, providing expert advice and guidance to senior Bureau managers on all aspects of Foreign Service position management, recruitment, assignment, and evaluation. <br />&bull; Counsels Foreign Service staff on all assignment related questions and provides support and guidance to those individuals who have been offered positions within the Bureau. Coordinates all FS issues with the appropriate offices within the Bureau of Human Resources, e.g., HR/CDA and HR/PE, resolving issues pertaining to FS assignments and performance, and recommends ways to improve or streamline the process. <br />&bull; Oversees suggestion and award, quality, and or productivity programs related to these activities. Analyzes and evaluates, on a quantitative or qualitative basis, the effectiveness of programs or operations in meeting established goals and objectives. <br />&bull; Liaises with colleagues and professional contacts in other bureaus whose work and role are relevant to supporting INL Offices, including but not limited to Diplomatic Security, the Office of Medical Services, HR Career Development, and Assignments, the Family Liaison Office, the Office of Foreign Missions, Overseas Schools, Allowances and more. <br />&bull; Ensures advance planning and coordination of Bureau-funded annual conferences or workshops; manages the development of agendas and speakers; and, as lead officer for the Bureaus' management officer workshop, directs support staff as needed in all phases of preparation, logistics, and security and representation requirements. <br />&bull; Analyzes administrative processes and/or agency programs for the Executive Director, with particular emphasis on management and implementation of an effective program in meeting Foreign Service human resources goals and objectives for the Bureau and its worldwide NAS operations. <br />&bull; Identifies problem areas and opportunities for improvement and provides fully staffed recommendations to management, including the Assistant Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretaries. This encompasses issues such as streamlining processes, assessing the feasibility of automated systems to meeting the Bureau's HR responsibilities, standardizing operations, or collaborating with other organizations on mutual responsibilities, improved management practices or the impact of new or proposed legislation or regulations on HR programs. <br />&bull; Communicates with colleagues, agency management, and other contacts outside the agency to gather and analyze information about these agency processes and programs. <br />Personal Contacts:<br />&bull; Contacts include subject matter experts throughout the Department, as well as officials from traditional foreign affairs and other USG agencies, e.g. USAID and the Departments of Defense and Justice. Other contacts are with contracting firms, host nation officials, and the public. Contacts occur in a variety of structured and unstructured settings, and require highly developed communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution and leadership skills to attain desired results.</p>
<p>Purpose of Contacts<br />&bull; Contacts are to influence, motivate, or persuade people or groups to accept opinions or to take actions related to the goals and objective of INL programs; and/or involve the commitment or distribution of major resources. The Officer often encounters opposition or resistance due to significant organizational conflicts, competing objectives, major resource limitations, or reductions. The Officer often serves as the INL representative in these settings, and must use a great deal of tact and professionalism in persuading stakeholders of the merits of his/her positions; achieving consensus; and/or winning buy-in with INL objectives.</p>
<p>Physical Demands<br />&bull; The work generally does not impose unusual physical demands on the Officer.<br />&bull; Periodic travel of varying duration may be required.</p>
<p>Work Environment<br />&bull; The majority of the work is performed in a standard office setting.</p>
<p>Guidelines <br />&bull; Guidelines consist of basic departmental and EUR-IO policies and regulations covering various administrative and management functions and programs, as well as country and local laws. These guidelines provide the basic information but often lack specificity and definitive answers or solutions and thus are insufficient in dealing with unique or unusual situations. Further, due to changing political climates and regional responsibilities, the Officer must re-evaluate their applicability in light of changing situations and determine when to deviate from standard approaches in developing appropriate strategies and processes to meet post requirements. Given their lack of specificity, the Officer uses a high degree of judgment, discretion, and ingenuity in interpreting and applying the intent of these guides, and in revising current policy and regulatory guidance for use by others engaged in overseas post management and operations within and outside of the Department, e.g. other USG agencies with employees at assigned posts.</p>
<p>Complexity <br />&bull; The work involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development and execution of INL policies and programs domestically, supporting INL missions at posts, and involves resolving a broad range of administrative and management issues using different and unrelated approaches and techniques in an environment of time-sensitive pressures and deadlines.</p>
<p>&bull; The Officer develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation of INL assignments at posts, as well as delivery of critical administrative services and guidance. The work necessitates handling multiple actions, problems, and relationships concurrently. Decisions on how to proceed are often complicated by conflicting goals and objectives of post management, host nation laws and requirements, and world events. Decisions and actions must also take into account the precedents that are being set, or at least the perception that precedents are being set, and the long-term implications of short-term solutions.</p>
<p>&bull; The Officer must deliver service and resolve problems in this environment, and ensure that all stakeholders are satisfied with the results of his/her decisions and recommendations.</p>
<p>Scope and Effect <br />&bull; The purposes of the work are to collaborate with management in the Department in providing prompt and effective administrative support of the assignment FS personnel domestically and at INL positions at posts; support INL missions at posts in engaging their administrative and personnel resources as effectively as possible; liaise with relevant Bureaus and USG agencies to ensure that the each post's best interests are protected; and ensure that administrative and substantive policies are mutually compatible.</p>
<p>&bull; The Officer's efforts play a critical role in ensuring that posts' administrative, operational, and managerial requirements are met to ensure their effective operations and ability to carry out their public diplomacy missions.</p>

<DESC><p>The Defense Logistics Agency Energy (DLA Energy) has posted Amendment 0004 to the Grand Forks AFB/Cavalier AFS solicitation, SPE600-13-R-0801. The purpose of the amendment is to revise Section J of the Request for Proposal and to replace the Section J, Attachment JA43, Specialty Skills Training Requirements, with Attachment JA43-1, Grand Forks AFB Training Requirements for Electrical Distribution System. The Attachment JA43-1 can be found in the secure package: SPE600-13-9545.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: To access the secured documents on the FBO website, all vendors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) first and foremost. If you are not registered in CCR, you will need to register in SAM.

All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.

<p>================================================================</p>
<p>Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within<br />the scope of the classifications listed may be added after<br />award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses<br />(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).</p>
<p><br />----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The body of each wage determination lists the classification<br />and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the<br />cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage<br />determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical<br />order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular<br />rate is union or non-union.</p>
<p><br />Union Identifiers</p>
<p>An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with<br />characters other than "SU" denotes that the union<br />classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that<br />classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The<br />first four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and<br />the four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local<br />union number or district council number where applicable ,<br />i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the<br />example, is an internal number used in processing the wage<br />determination. The date, 07/01/2011, following these<br />characters is the effective date of the most current<br />negotiated rate/collective bargaining agreement which would be<br />July 1, 2011 in the above example.</p>
<p>Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any<br />changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the<br />rate.</p>
<p>0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually<br />each January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Union Identifiers</p>
<p>Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived<br />from survey data by computing average rates and are not union<br />rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may<br />include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007<br />5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union rates, LA<br />indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the<br />survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the<br />wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates<br />the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued<br />as a General Wage Determination on that date.</p>
<p>Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change<br />until a new survey is conducted.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests<br />for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour<br />Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted<br />because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the<br />Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial<br />contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)<br />and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal<br />process described here, initial contact should be with the<br />Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an<br />interested party (those affected by the action) can request<br />review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator<br />(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the<br />interested party's position and by any information (wage<br />payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an<br />interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative<br />Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>
<p>================================================================</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  Quotes are being requested via this synopsis and a written solicitation will not be issued. Requisition Number W81EWF30080708 is being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) with the intent to award as a simplified acquisition.  The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65.  This requirement is a 100% set-aside for small business under NAICS Code 334413 (SIC 3674 ) with a size standard of 500 Employees. All cost associated with delivery to Vicksburg, MS shall be included in the quote.    <br>    <br>  The use of dense wavelength division multiplexers, in conjunction with fiber optic sensors, will be a key component of research and field support.  The objective is to incorporate these devices in a modular experimental setup to perform the multiple roles of supporting in-theatre sensor deployment, field testing, and in-house research and development.  Much of the work involves researching new applications using fiber optic cables as acoustic and seismic sensors, as well as supporting field deployment of fiber optic cables.    <br>    <br>    <br>  The requirements for the dense wavelength multiplexers are as follows:    <br>    <br>  SPECIFICATIONS FOR DENSE WAVELENGTH DIVISION MULTIPLEXERS (DWDMs)   <br>    <br>  A set of optical Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexers (DWDMs) with 50GHz ITU Channel Spacing, and three ports, covering five channels over the following telecom wavelengths, in what is known as the C-band for fiber optics (  = 1530 nm to 1562 nm):  <br>    <br>  *ITU Channel #	Wavelength,   [nm]	Frequency [GHz]	Quantity  <br>  C33	         1550.92	               193,300	    4  <br>  C34	         1550.12	               193,400	    4  <br>  C35	         1549.32	               193,500	    4  <br>  C36	         1548.52	               193,600	    4  <br>  C37	         1547.72	               193,700	    4  <br>    <br>  (*note:  ITU stands for  quote mark International Telecommunication Union, quote mark  and is used as a standard in the telecommunications industry).    <br>    <br>  DWDM's are used to multiplex light signals for fiber optic applications.  This particular DWDM design is often referred to in the literature as an 'Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer [1x2]'.   Wavelength division multiplexing is a technique whereby optical signals, of different wavelengths, may be combined, transmitted together, and separated again.

The Government will only accept a Class of antenna if all of the antennas in that Class are proposed. The Government will not consider any offer that does not include all of the antennas found in a particular class. The TEP will be determined based on the prices proposed for all the antennas in a particular class. The Government will award to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s), in response to the solicitation, provides the Government the lowest evaluated price, and meets the acceptability standards on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Price:</p>
<p>The price proposal will be evaluated for completeness to ensure pricing has been submitted for all items in a particular class of antenna (Platform, Deployable, or Lightweight). All proposals will be evaluated for unbalanced pricing. Offerors are cautioned that unbalanced unit prices may be grounds for exclusion of a proposal from consideration for award. The Government will determine a Total Evaluated Price (TEP) for each Schedule proposed class of antenna based upon known Government requirements for the five-year ordering period. The TEP will be calculated per antenna class by multiplying the Government provided "TEP Evaluated QTY" by the Offeror's proposed antenna price. The sum of all calculated prices for each CLIN will determine the TEP per antenna class.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Technical:</p>
<p>Each Technical sub-factor will receive a rating of acceptable or unacceptable. If any sub-factor is rated - "unacceptable," the entire proposal will be rated technically unacceptable, and the proposal will be excluded from award consideration.</p>
<p>Sub-factor 1: Technical Capability - Technical Capability - The Government will rate the Offeror's technical capability as "acceptable" if the Offeror provides documented evidence of meeting all the technical requirements stated in the Statement of Work and Antenna Performance Characteristics (per class of antennas).</p>
<p>Sub-factor 2: Delivery Schedule - The Government will evaluate the Offeror's delivery schedule proposed for each CLIN. The Government will rate the Offeror's delivery schedule as "acceptable" if at least the first 25 antennas of each CLIN proposed will be delivered within 90 days ARO.</p>

<p>(xx) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. (End of Clause)</p>
<p>(xxi) There are no additional contract requirements or terms and conditions for this solicitation.</p>
<p>(xxii) The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) is not applicable for this solicitation.</p>
<p>(xxiii) There are no numbered notes for this solicitation.</p>

<DESC>27 FEBRUARY 2013- The purpose of this notice is to correct an inadvertent error within the Market Research questions.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.
As prescribed in 1346.503, insert the following clause: Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract. (b) The place of acceptance will be: <BR> <BR>New equipment ONLY, NO grey market or refurbished products. Items must be in original packaging, never used, and not altered in any way. Components of the requested equipment, to include memory, must be manufacturer-approved and may not be compatible, remanufactured, or refurbished equipment. All items must be covered by manufacturer?s warranty and procured through a manufacturer approved distribution channel. Sellers must be able to document their ability to provide items through manufacturer approved distribution channels upon request.
The Seller confirms to have sourced all products submitted in this Bid from manufacturer-approved channels for Federal sales, in accordance with all applicable laws and manufacturer?s current applicable policies at the time of purchase. Seller must be able to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with applicable manufacturer certification / specialization requirements. If software is provided or included, Seller shall, upon request, provide Buyer with a copy of the End User License Agreement. Seller certifies that all software is licensed originally to Buyer as the original licensee authorized to use the software. <BR> <BR>All Bids must be valid for 30 days from the closing date for this solicitation. No exceptions or qualifications. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No bids will be accepted from bidders proposing to use another firm?s GSA schedule, even if they have permission of the firm to use it. The bidder must be the owner of the GSA schedule in order to bid and to be considered for award. Bids that do not comply with this offer term will be removed from consideration. By proactively complying with this offer term, Sellers accept that the Government will make award to the GSA schedule holder only, as the sole awardee. Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the Government and receive payment from the Government. <BR> <BR>GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101. In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.") <BR> <BR>Bid prices for EACH line item must be accurate, fair, and reasonable, as determined by the contracting officer, using competitive price comparisons, market research, etc. Bundling multiple line item prices together (?materially unbalanced? pricing) is NOT acceptable, unless that exact bundle is listed as a single CLIN on the bidder?s contract. Any bid may be rejected if the prices for any line items are materially unbalanced. Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items as well. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><strong>TITLE<br /></strong>Minority Institutions of Higher Education (MIHE) Government Contracting Workshop
<p><strong>ABOUT THIS WORKSHOP <br /></strong>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) provides information for Minority Institutions of Higher Education (MIHE) that are interested in doing business with the Federal Government. This workshop was created to help MIHEs 1) become familiar with processes and procedures associated with federal government contracting; and 2) to identify and pursue contract opportunities with HHS. The objective of these workshops is to engage, equip, and inform the educational institution participants of the federal procurement process so that they become more effective in pursuing contracting opportunities at HHS. If you are not a MIHE, but are an educational institution of higher learning, and you would like to attend, please contact fedgovconworkshops@d2dinc.com.</p>
<p><strong>The workshop will cover:<br /></strong>Overview of the Federal Market/Procurement Process<br />Marketing to the Department of Health &amp; Human Services and Other Federal Agencies<br />Proposal Development<br />Price Proposal Development<br />Overview of Contract Compliance</p>
<p><strong>DATES &amp; LOCATIONS:<br /></strong>&bull; <strong>Wednesday, March 6, 2013<br /></strong>University of Puerto Rico<br />Medical Sciences Campus<br />School of Pharmacy<br />San Juan, PR<br />***Please note: the workshop will be conducted in English<br /><br />&bull; <strong>April 2013<br /></strong>&nbsp; Nashville, TN<br />&nbsp; TBD</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>May 2013<br /></strong>&nbsp; Houston, TX<br />&nbsp; TBD</p>
<p>This posting will be updated as more information becomes available. Please visit http://fedgovconworkshops.com/ for more information. The time of each workshop is different, so please visit the website.</p>
<p><strong>COST:</strong> FREE - there is no cost to register</p>
<p><strong>REGISTRATION<br /></strong>Pre-registration is required and limited. Registration will close when it is full. A link for each location is provided at http://fedgovconworkshops.com/.</p>
<p>If you register and cannot attend, please cancel your registration as soon as possible so that someone on the wait list can participate.</p>
<p>If you have questions regarding the event, please contact conference support at fedgovconworkshops@d2dinc.com.</p>
<p><strong>Who should attend?<br /></strong>MIHE faculty and staff who are interested in pursuing government contracts or who have initiated the process, but have not yet been successful should attend this workshop. Individuals already involved in government contracting should attend to gain additional knowledge about the process and to network with HHS staff attending the workshop. Faculty and staff from all types of MIHEs and other institutions of higher learning will find this workshop helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I attend?<br /></strong>The Federal Government is an excellent, and often times, untapped resource of revenue. In this economy, educational institutions need additional sources of revenue to supplement other funding efforts. This can be done by securing contracts to support government customers with a variety of services including areas such as research projects. MIHE faculty and staff should attend a workshop so they understand the government contracting environment and have the tools necessary to navigate the government processes.</p>
<p><strong>I'm a teacher and can't afford to miss class. Can I attend part of the workshop? <br /></strong>We understand that class schedules may overlap with the workshop schedule. This is a four-hour workshop scheduled in the afternoon/early evening in hopes to avoid most scheduling conflicts. We hope that you can join us for the entire event; however there is no requirement to attend the entire workshop. Come during the time that is convenient for your schedule.</p>
<p><strong>I already know the basics of government contract. My school already has government contracts. How will this workshop help me?<br /></strong>You may be familiar with the basics; however this workshop will delve deeper into govcon topics. This includes an overview of the federal market/procurement process; grants versus contracts; market research/opportunity identification; proposal development; understanding contract pricing; and overview of contract administration and compliance. You will also have the opportunity to interact with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) OSDBU representatives who will be on-site during the workshop.</p>

<p>Dear Prospective Offerors:</p>
<p>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to the Philippines, is soliciting proposals from qualified local organizations interested in providing the services detailed in the attached RFP for a project that will be administered by USAID's Office of Economic Development and Governance (OEDG).</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted through full and open competition among Philippine organizations only, for which the procedures for "contracting by negotiation, trade-off process" method of procurement, as described in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), will apply.</p>
<p>Proposals will be accepted from Philippine private, for-profit and non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including universities, research organizations, professional associations, and other relevant special interest associations. Faith-based and community organizations are also eligible to participate. In support of USAID's interest in expanding the number and sustainability of development partners, USAID encourages proposals from potential new local partners.</p>
<p>USAID/Philippines plans to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) completion type contract. <strong><em>The&nbsp;estimated amount of the contract (costs and fee) is US$ 24million covering a performance period of five years.</em></strong> Offerors must propose costs that they believe are appropriate, realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost proposals will be evaluated as part of the Best-Value procedure in determining contract award, including cost effectiveness of approaches to achieve the desired results.</p>
<p>This solicitation consists of this cover letter and the attached RFP. All Offerors are cautioned to carefully review this cover letter and the contents of the RFP.</p>
<p>Issuance of this solicitation and receipt of proposals from interested Offerors do not constitute a commitment on the part of the U.S Government or USAID to make an award. Neither does it constitute an obligation to reimburse interested Offerors for any costs they incurred in the preparation and submission of their proposal. Award of a contract will be subject to availability of funds and proper completion of required USAID internal processes.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it received the solicitation document in its entirety, including subsequent solicitation amendments, if any. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.</p>

However, qualifying firms which did respond may acknowledge having viewed this amended text and indicate your continued interest via email to the Contracts Specialist indicated below.  Interested WOSB concerns which did not respond to the earlier notices may submit capability statements, in accordance with the format, parameters and required information indicated below.

Small businesses must comply with FAR 52.219-14 -- Limitations on Subcontracting, regarding contract performance (at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern).  Is your company capable of providing a team composition that can support the entire scope of this contract effort with sufficient depth to perform the variety of tasks of varying complexity while performing at least 50 percent of the work?

<a href="mailto:kirstin.quinn@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) has a requirement for the following:  <br>    <br>  The Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) has tasked the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) to direct a medical research program.  As a function of this process, the Headquarters, USAMRMC receives scientific proposals, progress reports, and similar intramural documents from the Command's research laboratories and extramurally from the academic and scientific research community.  Each of these documents is reviewed for program relevance and, where appropriate, for scientific merit.  Peer review, a process of self-regulation involving evaluation by qualified individuals within the relevant field, is the mechanism used by the command to execute these reviews.  Extramural areas of research interest are summarized in the current USAMRMC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and in Program Announcements (PA).  Program Announcements will result in full proposals, and either pre-proposals or Letters of Intent (LOI).  While peer review within the USAMRMC is not governed by statute or DoD, Army, or USAMRMC policy or regulation, the requirements for the USAMRMC peer review program parallels many of the requirements detailed in 42 CFR, Part 52h, Scientific Peer Review of Research Grant Applications and Research and Development Contract Projects.  In addition, this command is tasked with on-going active management of research.  Periodic scientific and programmatic peer review of on-going research (performance reviews) is also required.  <br>    <br>  This will be a non-personal services support contract which contains no services that are Inherently Governmental Functions as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101 and 7.5.  The services required under this contract are subject to Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) IAW the FAR Subpart 9.5, as performance of these services will give the Contractor access to extensive data about contracts and assistance agreements of other contractors and research institutions that support the USAMRMC mission.  A draft OCI Mitigation plan will be included in the technical approach as part of the proposal, with the final plan due 10 days after award.  <br>    <br>  This contracting effort will provide an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)  type contract, with four option years. Task Orders will be firm fixed priced.  Functions to be performed under this IDIQ:  <br>    <br>  a.	Administrative management of Broad Agency Announcement and select Program Announcements.  <br>  b.	Administrative management of extramural Letters of Intent (LOI), pre, and full proposals for research and medical research related conferences.  <br>  c.	Scientific Peer Reviews of research proposals.  <br>  i.	Mail  <br>  ii.	Panel  <br>  iii.	Intramural  <br>  d.	Scientific Performance or Program Peer Review for on-going research.  <br>  e.	Other special scientific and/or programmatic reviews.  <br>  f.	Scientific Consulting Services.  <br>  g.	Electronic management of data and files.  <br>    <br>  All responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the agency.  The competitive solicitation, solicitation amendments and all questions and answers relating to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ or https://www.fedbizopps.gov.  <br>      <br>  The solicitation is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about, April 8, 2013.  Specifications of the requirement are provided in solicitation: W81XWH-13-R-0021.     <br>    <br>  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the website.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> PRIORITY 3 ACQUISITION MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION BELOW THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD <br>  <br> 1.  Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 <br>  <br> 2.  Description of Action: Urgent procurement of Total Reverse Shoulder replacement implants System needed for a non-routine surgery.   <br>  <br> 3.  Description of Products/Services:  Total Reverse Shoulder is used for surgical treatment for Shoulder replacement implants.     <br>  <br> 4.  Authority Cited:  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106-1(b) (1), Soliciting competition.  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency). <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 5.202(a) (2), Exceptions. The unusual and compelling requirement will not be advertised. <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106(c)(1), Soliciting competition.  Price and availability will be obtained telephonically. <br>  <br> 5.  Reason for Cited Authority: The above statutory authority is cited because this is a true, urgent request that has been verified by Emerita Torres on 7 February 2013.  The Total Reverse Shoulder System must be received for a non-routine surgery scheduled on 11 February 2013.  If the physician does not have this System during surgery, it could be detrimental to the patient's life as well as the hospital's overall medical mission.  <br>  <br> 6.  Contracting Officer Certification:  I certify this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br>  <br> Signature:  //Signed 2/7/2013// <br> Name:    Melissa Oliva				 <br> Title:   Contracting Officer			 <br>

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is seeking proposals from qualified organizations and/or higher education institutions to provide:
<p>1. Instructor-led training on the use of the OpenStudio whole-building energy modeling software and SDK.<br />2. User and technical support to OpenStudio users.<br />NREL shall provide OpenStudio training modules and material to the appointed training organization(s) under a license agreement. NREL intends to award license agreements resulting from this solicitation to the most qualified proposals based on the criteria stated herein. Such license will be made available without charge to selected higher education institutions who intend to offer the training program in connection with a course for which college or university credit is available. All other organizations will be required to pay an annual upfront fee of US$2,500.</p>
<p>Authorized OpenStudio trainers will be selected pursuant to the process described in this Announcement and will have access to detailed training curriculums developed by the NREL under the terms of the license agreement. The curriculum will be broken down into a series of modules allowing trainers to customize the training to the needs and experience level of the audience, as well as the time available for the class. Each module will have a detailed agenda, step by step instructions, and sample files. Some modules may also have a PowerPoint presentation that can be used to introduce an exercise.</p>
<p>NREL will update the training material as new OpenStudio releases are issued and as funding permits. Trainers will be able to offer attendees Continuing Education Units (CEU) from participating organizations such as the American Institute of Architects (AIA), Illuminating Engineers Society (IES). Trainers will attend a "Train the Trainers" workshop upon becoming an authorized OpenStudio training organization. Trainers will have direct access to the OpenStudio development team for support (both for training and for technical support) and to provide feedback on features and workflows. A few times a year, as appropriate, NREL will preview new or up-coming features to the authorized trainers via a webinar. NREL may list authorized training organizations on the OpenStudio website, to make it easier for trainers and users to find each other.</p>
<p>This Announcement constitutes the only solicitation; electronic proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>NREL reserves the right to issue more than one RFQ and to award more than one training or technical support organization. The license agreement(s) will renew annually, pending NREL assessment and periodic review of the training organization performance and qualifications. Such agreements may be terminated at any time by the training or technical support organization or by NREL for failure to comply with negotiated performance obligations. Such obligations may include, without limitation, a training evaluation form to be completed by training participants upon completion of the course and provided to NREL, maintenance of certain training qualifications during the term of the license and a commitment to refer requests for bug-fixes made by OpenStudio users to NREL. In addition, NREL may solicit additional training organizations at any time to replace or increase existing training needs to fulfill the OpenStudio software and SDK training or technical support needs.</p>
