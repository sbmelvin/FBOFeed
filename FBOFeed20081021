The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric distribution system for the Pennsylvania Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at Harrisburg International Airport (IAP), to Metropolitan Edison (Met-Ed).  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. Met-Ed (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows The Pennsylvania Air National Guard 193rd Special Operations Wing (SOW) is located at the Harrisburg International Airport, and is located in south central Pennsylvania, approximately 105 miles west of Philadelphia and nine miles north-west of Harrisburg.  The airport is owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is operated by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Aviation. The ANG occupies 23 buildings; 15 industrial; 6 administrative; and 2 services, amounting to approximately 295,000 square feet on 36 acres at the east-end of the airport. There are approximately 300 full time personnel on base with a twice a month drill weekend surge to approximately 1000 personnel. The Harrisburg International Airport (ANG) electrical system is an underground looped delta configuration.  The voltage is distributed at 13,200 volts and enters the base at one location on the east side of the base in a switch gear unit located at building number 71 (Corrosion Control Hanger on Olmsted Blvd).  The system contains 12 pad mounted transformers that range from 75kVA to 1000 kVA, six disconnect switches, and approximately 3200 linear feet of 15 kV 500 MCM copper wiring that is enclosed in duct banks buried at approximately three feet below the finished grade. The system was installed primarily in 1982 with transformer ages ranging from 1978 to 1998.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2001 and no offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.

NCI.<span>&nbsp; </span>Contractor shall comply with good
manufacturing practices (GMP).<span>&nbsp; </span>There is

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The majority of patients with
advanced metastatic cancer now enrolled in the NCI clinical trials have failed
conventional and most experimental treatments such as chemotherapy, treatment
with cytokine proteins, vaccination with tumor antigen peptides and recombinant
viruses that encode tumor antigens.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
retrovirus-producing master cell banks and clinical grade retroviral vector
generated within the NCI will support clinical protocols within NCI such as adoptive
transfer of tumor reactive T cells.<span>&nbsp; </span>NCI patients
with metastatic melanoma have a median survival time of six (6) months, and
patients rarely survive longer than three (3) years. <span>&nbsp;</span>Between three hundred (300) and four hundred (400)
new patients with metastatic melanoma are now being treated in the NCI each
year.</span></p>

supplying the necessary biosafety testing of our master cell bank and retroviral
vectors.<span>&nbsp; </span>BioReliance has developed and
validated a rigorous series of safety testing protocols with significant
Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) oversight in accordance with
accepted regulatory guidelines.<span>&nbsp; </span>In
addition, the proposed clinical trials may have a direct impact on patient
survival, and it is therefore crucial that these services be obtained without
delay.<span>&nbsp; </span>The need to develop experiment
protocols and verify that these procedures can be utilized for larger clinical
trials is essential to the development of life-saving therapies. </span></p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division (APPCD), located in RTP, North Carolina intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under theauthority of FAR 6.302-1, with Tekran Instruments Corporation for Three (3) Tekran 3332 Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring System Replacement Sample Probes.
   This procurement is for the replacement of Three (3) 3332 Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring System Sample Probes by the original equipment manufacturer, Tekran Instruments Corporation. The sample probes are components of EPA/NRMRL/APPCD's Tekran Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems. The existing sample probes are obsolete and are no longer technically supported. The estimated value of the mercury sample probes is $40,000. 
   The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capabilities to provide the sample probes, labor and expertise to upgrade our existing Continuous Emission Monitoring System. These unique capabilities are essential because if the Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring System Sample Probes upgrade cannot be obtained, EPA will not be able to operate its current Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring System to perform necessary research. 
   EPA has identified Tekran Instruments Corporation as the only provider of commercial equipment able to meet the requirements of this procurement. Subsequently EPA has determined that Tekran Instruments Corporation is the only manufacturer that can provide the items that can meet the requirement listed above.
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the items with the specifications listed above may submit appropriate documentation within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Michael Kreacic via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email kreacic.michael@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

A.  BACKGROUND

USAID/Ethiopias Health, AIDS, Population and Nutrition (HAPN) Team implements programs in health, with HIV/AIDS constituting the largest portion of the health program, at over $200 million for FY 2008.

HIV/AIDS activities are implemented through the Presidents Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which includes programs in primary prevention of HIV, Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT), Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC), palliative care, antiretroviral Treatment (ART), HIV/AIDS counseling and testing (HCT), and other care and support programs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:stacy.d.thurman@usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District</a>
<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ISSUED UNDER THE COMPETITIVE 8 (A) PROCEDURES.  COMPETITION WILL BE LIMITED TO 8 (A) FIRMS LOCATED WITHIN THE SURROUNDING GEOGRAPHICAL AREA SERVICES BY THE SBA-MISSISSIPPI DISTRICT OFFICE AND FIRMS WITHIN LA, TN, AL AND GA.  The target ceiling for contract award for design and construction is $16,000,000.00.  The Government cannot guarantee that additional funds can be made available for award.  Offerors are under no obligation to approach this amount.  This project is for the Design and Construction of an office facility consisting of approximately 70,000 square feet of office, conference and general use space for the Environmental Laboratory (EL) at the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) located in Vicksburg, Mississippi.  The Design-Build process will have two distinct phases. Phase-I will be the pre-qualification process, where the Government will select 2 to 5 Design-Build Contractors on the basis of Project Organization and Personnel, Offeror's Experience and Resource Commitment, Management Control Systems, Past Performance, Management/Technical Compliance Certification, and Financial Capacity.  The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Project Organization and Personnel being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important.<BR>Only the selected Design-Build Contractors will then qualify for the Phase-II of the process. In Phase-II of the procurement procedure, offerors will be given the opportunity to offer their preliminary design and cost proposals.  Final selection and basis for award of the design-build contract will be on the basis of Qualifications, Technical Quality, Price, and Other Salient Factors considered to be in the Government's best interests. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Qualifications being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important.  A stipend in the amount of $25,000.00 will be paid to all unsuccessful Phase II offerors whose technical proposal meets the solicitation requirements.  No stipend will be paid to any offeror that withdraws from the competition prior to award.  This is not a low bid award project. If awarded the contract, the offeror shall complete the design and construction documents and construct the facility in compliance with these completed requirements.  The new building will consist of providing individual office space accommodating 289 employees with capability for 25 percent expansion. The building could be two or three stories and shall be sited to increase visibility and impact from the initial approach to the building. The D-B Contractor shall design the new building with parking, sidewalks, landscaping, etc. for a campus-like environment. The new building shall complement other structures in the area around the building. However, design and construction creativity and innovation is encouraged.  <BR> <BR>Environmental Laboratory (EL) of the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) has several branches currently housed in separate locations on the ERDC compound. This project is to relocate all branches within the EL to a single building. Personnel will be housed in the new building that will be developed to promote organizational unity, mission congruence, and esprit de corps. The new construction is to be state of the art, cutting edge technology, with a positive first impression of the facility. The facility should communicate that this is a top Research & Development (R & D) facility at this location in a way that promotes group identity and pride, complements recruitment and supports staff retention. To accomplish this, the building shall be designed and constructed so that the building facilitates and encourages interaction among all EL personnel, and provides equal access by personnel in all of the departments. The project shall be designed with the intent of maximizing the use of sustainable design and development practices. The Design-Build contractor shall adhere to green building rating standards of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) to achieve GOLD certification as defined by USGBC.  A LEED Accredited Professional will be a mandatory team member. An ultimate goal is to submit the new building for environmental awards at the Army level or higher.<BR><BR>The building shall be classified as a Primary Gathering Building. If the conventional construction stand-off distances, as defined by US Army standards, are provided, conventional construction may be used for the building without a specific analysis of blast effects.<BR><BR>Plans and Specifications will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Web Page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Offerors may register on the Interested Vendors List (IVL) at http://www.2fbo.gov/ and retrieve an IVL from the same location. All technical inquiries and questions relating to W912EE-09-R-0001 are to be submitted via Bidder Inquiry in ProjNet at http://www.projnet.org/projnet.  Compact disc and hardcopies will not be available.  Offerors should check often for changes (Amendments).  Issue date on or about November 10, 2008.  Phase I of the Request for Proposal Due on or about December 11, 2008.  The due date for Phase II of the Request for Proposal will be determined after evaluation/selections have been made for Phase I.  <BR><BR>FUNDS ARE NOT PRESENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS ACQUISITION.  NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE UNTIL APPROPRIATED FUNDS ARE MADE AVAILABLE.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>TITLE:  LITENING Support Sources Sought Synopsis (THIS IS NOT AREQUEST FOR PROPOSAL)DESCRIPTION:The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding a requirement to provide logistics sustainment activities and follow-on product support operations for LITENING Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) currently integrated on the following platforms: F-15E, F-16, B-52, A-10, F/A-18, AV-8, EA-6B.  Support for the LITENING ATPs shall include AT, AT Block 1 and Gen 4 pod versions with three (3) datalink configurations. The purpose of the LITENING Targeting Pod System (LTPS) Support Program is to accommodate USAF, Air National Guard (ANG), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), United States Navy (USN), and United Stated Marine Corp (USMC) requirements for fielded LTPS.  The USAF proposes to establish a LITENING Support Contract (LSC) effective 1 January 2010, to provide LTPS users with support in the areas of LITENING ATP maintenance and upgrades (to include applicable Advanced Targeting Pod-Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) upgrades), Operational Flight Program (OFP) maintenance and upgrades, aircrew and maintenance training, site activation, over and above support, source documentation, technical manual maintenance, flight test support, studies, demonstrations, and pod integration support across aircraft platforms via Interim Contractor Support (ICS) or Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  The ATP-SE Program is a follow-on to the current USAF ATP programs and it is anticipated that upgrade of legacy ATPs, such as the LTPS, will not be within the scope of that program.  If the Government does require future upgrades of legacy ATP systems it is anticipated that work will be done by the contractors selected for continuing support and sustainment of individual legacy ATP systems, such as that being synopsized in this announcement.  The LTPS Support Program key acquisition objectives are to maintain or improve the current level of support to the LTPS users, accommodate DoD policy requirements such as Unique Item Identification (UID) and Operational, Safety, Suitability, & Effectiveness (OSS&E) tracking, and manage obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  Factors that will be used to implement and administer the program: 1. Ship replacement Line Replacement Units (LRUs) within seven (7) calendar days after a faulty LRU reaches the contractors facility.  For items deployed outside of continental United States (CONUS) the user will be responsible for shipment between CONUS and the deployed location. Interested sources shall have the potential capability to ship serviceable assets outside CONUS.   2. The selected source shall ensure 92% availability of LITENING ATPs in each fleet. 3.  The source shall monitor and report performance on a weekly and monthly basis via a secured website.  4.  The source shall be able to meet Depot Turn Around Time (TAT).  Depot TAT shall be measured using the median of the monthly LRU repair time. The Government expects the establishment of a flexible contract structure that will allow for the continuation of supplies and services necessary to fulfill the mission, maintain peacetime and training operations, ensure combat capabilities, and pod fleet disposition alternatives as pods transition into the final stages of their service life.  The Government contemplates the LSC will be a five-year Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract as a follow-on to current LITENING ID/IQ contracts with Northrop Grumman System Corporation (NGC), the Original Equipment Manufacturer and prime contractor.  It should be noted that NGC and Rafael own proprietary data which may be required in order to provide the support necessary in this LSC.  In the statement of qualifications, interested sources shall include their approach to obtaining the necessary data, as the Government will not provide the data.  The sponsoring activity is 647th Aeronautical Systems Squadron, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  Sources responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business, or a minority institution.  This effort is open to US bidders only.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code is 336413.  Interested sources shall register as a source on the PIXS website (https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil). Also, interested sources must respond with a complete capability/qualification package describing their technical expertise and experience, personnel and facilities.

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Synopsis is a Request for Information to assist the Hill AFB, Utah Range Threat System Program Office (RTSPO) in Market Research of Industry to (1) determine the feasibility of the design, development and production for the Joint Threat Emitter Increment 2 (JI2) program based on a competitive acquisition strategy; and (2) identify potential sources. This Sources Sought Synopsis supercedes previous Sources Sought Synopsis' Reference-Number-FA8217-08-R-TBD_ (posted 7 Nov 07), Reference-Number-FA8217-08-R-TBD2 (posted 8 Nov 07), FA8217-08-R-XXX2 (posted 8 Apr 08).
<p>The program office plans to generate requirements that lead to a phased-contract award approach, to help reduce program cost and technical risks. The 1st phase would consist of a competitive source selection that results in awarding a cost-plus type contract to potentially multiple contractors to develop and deliver a system design package. The 1st phase contract award is planned for approximately 3rd quarter FY09.</p>
<p>As part of the 2nd phase, a second source selection competition would take place between the contractors who delivered a system design package under the 1st phase contracts, and (possibly) contractors who become source qualified based on delivery of an adequate system design package they develop/complete exclusively at their own expense. The delivered system design packages would be evaluated as a component of the second phase source selection, and a best value award would be made to only one contractor for (1) delivery of one prototype (that gets fully developed, tested, and accepted) using a cost-plus type pricing arrangement; and (2) option(s) for delivery of approximately 20 production units at Firm-Fixed Prices.</p>
<p>The program office needs to determine approximately how long a contractor requires for developing and delivering a system design package (if they are awarded a contract under the 1st phase) that allows the contractor to provide (in a follow-on 2nd phase proposal) a 90% certainty of their proposed development costs and proposed Firm-Fixed Price production unit prices.</p>
<p>JI2 is the second development effort associated with the Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) program. The purpose of JI2 is to emulate the SA-15b Surface to Air Missile threat. Top-level system requirements and a technical description are listed below.</p>
<p>Request each interested contractor:<br />&bull; Identify an estimated point (e.g., Critical Design Review) or required length of time, during the development effort, that is required to develop and deliver a system design package that allows the contractor to propose a 90% certainty cost for delivery of one pre-production unit that gets fully developed/ tested/accepted, and a Firm-Fixed Price for production JI2 units under an Option. <br />&bull; Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of the estimated total cost for the system design package effort.<br />&bull; Provide a ROM of the estimated total cost for delivery of one pre-production unit that gets fully developed, tested, and accepted under 2nd phase.<br />&bull; Identify its ability to produce with no quantity restrictions (in case the Government does not receive an entire re-procurement package with no less than full Government Purpose Rights that allow for full and open competition, on everything). This is especially important for non-profit applied research type of contractors. <br />&bull; Identify if the company is a small-business and/or meets any other unique classification (e.g. 8(A)).<br />&bull; Identify an estimated completion time-frame for the 2nd phase delivery.<br />&bull; Provide input (with rationale) if the company does not believe that a cost-plus type pricing arrangement is the most appropriate for any of the above identified development-type effort (1st phase and/or 2nd phase). Also provide input (with rationale) if your company does not believe that a cost incentive would likely motivate the contractor to manage effectively.<br />&bull; Provide supporting rationale that they can meet the identified requirements. Specifically, include a description of:<br />1. Their experience developing similar systems.<br />2. The maturity of any technologies they would propose using.<br />3. Risk reduction efforts they would use for their proposed development, prototype, and production effort.<br />4. Technical maturity of the anticipated phased array antenna element, antenna design approach to include a description of the antenna element and phase shifters, and all existing systems and/or applications using the same operational frequency and bandwidth of the technology anticipated to be utilized. <br />&bull; Even though delivery of the requested ROMs is not required, please note that a delivered ROM would be determined to be very beneficial as part of market research, and that a delivered ROM will not be used to make an award decision, or to obligate the Government.</p>
<p><br />JI2 Top-Level System Requirements:</p>
<p>General Description: JI2 will consist of a Control Unit identified as JI2-CU, a Radar Unit identified as JI2-RU and will operate with a GFE power generator. The system will be a high-fidelity representation of the Radio Frequency output of the real threat system and will be mobile, operable on the move, and maintainable by organic personnel. The system will contain radars that have internal situational awareness capability and can track multiple targets. The system will be capable of autonomous operation, or deployed as part of an Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) and will contain a robust debriefing capability to support war-fighter training. The system will be highly maintainable and reliable.</p>
<p>Threat System: JI2 will emulate a true transmit (TX) and receive (RX) SA-15b radar for the Target Track Radar (TTR), Search and Acquisition Radar (SAR) and will: <br />&bull; The TTR will be highly mobile, full fidelity, true transmit and receive threat radar with multiple simultaneous aircraft tracks (minimum of 2).<br />&bull; The SAR will be highly mobile, full fidelity, true transmit and receive threat radar with ability to generate an air situation picture tracking and prioritizing multiple simultaneous aircraft tracks ( Minimum of 48) with search and track &lsquo;on the move' operations.<br />&bull; Produce antenna patterns representative of the actual threat to include antenna main beam and 1st order side lobes for the SA-15b TTR and SAR at a minimum.<br />&bull; Track the targets using skin tracking. External pointing sources (including ACTS/P5 and other TSPI sources, Identification Friend or Foe [IFF], Federal Aviation Administration [FAA]/DoD radars, Red IADS, etc.) will provide initial pointing information to initiate system-level target acquisition and track initiation.<br />&bull; Be designed to emulate the reactivity of the real system, in lieu of using an EA Receiver, since this increment is multi-track.</p>
<p>Mobility: JI2 will consist of a shelter or pallet with skids that can be carried on the back of a standard 1 to 5 ton vehicle and when not mounted on the vehicle can fit on a military stock listed and/or non-specially made commercially procured trailer. The shelter/pallet must have the capability of being lifted by helo/crane and have fork holes for forklift loading/unloading.</p>
<p>Weight Limit: JI2 including the generator will weigh a maximum of 10,000 lbs.</p>
<p>Reactivity: JI2 must possess reactivity capability for threat system engagement of target platforms with or without air combat instrumentation.</p>
<p>Aircrew Feedback: JI2 must possess a video system (with zoom lens) with display and digital record capability to provide post-mission feedback for aircrew debriefing. The camera will be operationally independent of the TTR. If aircraft is within line of sight and visibility is greater than 17 nm, the camera will be capable of tracking a clean F-16 (no external tanks) at all aspect angles and viewing a tracked aircraft (selected by operator) at a distance of 17 nm.</p>
<p>JI2 Technical Description:</p>
<p>JI2 will be an unclassified, high-fidelity emitter system that will emulate some or all of the signals of the SA-15b. The minimum signals to represent are the SA-15b target acquisition and tracking radar signals. The emitter system is expected to have two antennas, one for acquisition and the second (phased array) for target tracking and missile guidance. The acquisition antenna will support the operational frequency and bandwidth, and antenna beams that match the real system and support determination of the air-situation picture. The target tracking antenna will be a phased array, electronically scanned in azimuth and elevation. This antenna must operate in the J-Band (10 - 20 GHz) frequency range. <br />The threat emitter's signals must be generated with sufficient fidelity to be recognized and processed by applicable onboard sensors to include Radar Warning Receivers (RWRs), Electronic Attack systems, and High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile Targeting systems associated with existing military aircraft.</p>
<p>Antenna patterns will accurately replicate those of the SA-15b, to include antenna main beam and 1st order side lobes. Output power of the phased array antenna will be the full ERP of the SA-15b as defined by the Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming database. <br />The acquisition antenna signal(s) will emulate the SA-15b Search and Acquisition antenna at a 60 RPM rotation rate. The acquisition signal will be transmit and receive with true situational awareness displays</p>
<p>The threat emitter must be designed to operate in a military ground mobile environment. Environmental testing for shock, vibration, thermal (Operational between-40 degrees Fahrenheit to +125 degrees Fahrenheit with sun loading) will be used to verify environmental compliance. A single platform will be used. The total weight will be less than 10K pounds and transportable with a commercially available vehicle (Threshold). The desired weight is under 5K lbs, and when under 5K pounds, the system must be helo transportable without dismantling requiring special tools or equipment. The threat emitter will be mobile and operational (Acquisition Antenna only) on the move. The TTR antenna will be available for use immediately upon stopping of movement. The threat emitter will be capable of being deployed for training use in forward operating locations and deployed at improved (e.g. graded roads and concrete pads) and unimproved (e.g. no roads, no pad - literally anywhere on a range) sites.</p>
<p>The threat emitter will have the capability to receive, display, measure and store target track related data and provide feedback in ADDS/ICADS/TENA format for Aircrew Debriefing.</p>
<p>The threat emitter will be designed as a modular system with replaceable sub-assemblies to enable future implementation of additional objective threats, IR/UV stimulation systems) and support ACMI inputs from the range for initial pointing, and additional outputs for Aircrew Debriefing. The modularity will also facilitate minor repairs within 20 minutes to four hours, and complex repairs within two to eight hours. The Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) will be no less than 500 hours for the entire system, with the objective of 1000 hours or greater. The system will be designed for a system Up-Time Ratio (UTR) of 8 hours per day (Threshold) or 16 hours per day (Objective), 5 days per week, and 48 weeks per year for the 20 year life of the system. The threat emitter will be designed to meet 90 to 100 percent availability of the entire threat emitter during the scheduled operation of the system. The interval between scheduled maintenance actions must be greater than 30 days (Threshold) to no less than 60 days (Objective) with a duration of less than 90 minutes (Threshold) or 60 minutes (Objective) not including travel time.</p>
<p>The threat emitter will use a government determined 2-Level maintenance concept and be highly reliable and maintainable. Level 1 Organizational/Intermediate level (on/off-equipment) maintenance will be performed by military/contractor support personnel and Level 2 will be performed by either contracted and/or organic support.</p>
<p>The JTE Increment 1 (Block 0, Kit 1) system (which was delivered under a delivery order F09603-01-D-0209-QP05 to MTC Technologies, Inc./Cage Code 9J721) is not required to use the core Block 0, Kit 1 for the design of the JI2. Since the Government may not have a competitive bid package for the JTE Increment 1 (Block 0, Kit 1) system, if a contractor identifies a solution to use the core JTE Increment 1 (a threat kit integrated on the JTE), the contractor must clearly identify (with supporting rationale) how they have the ability to meet the requirements without a JTE Block 0, Kit 1 technical/software package from the Government. At a minimum, following is the technical data and software necessary for compatibility with the JTE Increment 1 that cannot be released due to limited and/or restricted rights include:</p>
<p>- Threat Emitter Unit Signal Generator (CEESIM) software<br />- Range Data Integration Processor components of the Command &amp; Control subsystem software<br />- Mission Situation Awareness Terminal components of the Command &amp; Control subsystem software<br />- Transmitter controller software</p>

<a href="mailto:temidayo.osinuga@nnsa.doe.gov">Osinuga, Temidayo I</a>
<DESC>The US Department of Energy (DOE) seeks qualified small business sources capable of designing, producing, and providing ongoing engineering support for a specialized tactical vehicle.  The Escort Vehicle Light Chassis (EVLC) Program, as defined by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Secure Transportation (OST), is tasked to provide a fleet of support vehicles for use in OST mission operations.  The Office of Secure Transportation provides safe and secure transportation of nuclear weapons, components, and special nuclear materials, and conducts other missions supporting the national security of the United States of America.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 336992, Military Armored Vehicle, Tank, and Tank Component Manufacturers, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.  The successful EVLC concept shall be a specialized response vehicle capable of sustained interstate highway operations (in excess of 24 continuous hours), light duty off-road maneuvering, and comfortable operating conditions for three (3) personnel; including special accommodations for one (1) passenger in a sleeper berth.  The EVLC shall include the integration of communications equipment provided by the Government, adequate cargo capacity for passenger equipment, installation of various Law Enforcement-type vehicle accessories, and the modification of electrical and/or mechanical systems of an Original Equipment Manufacture?s (OEM) vehicle chassis.  The EVLC concept shall include the design, fabrication, and incorporation of unique features, parts, and armor.   EVLC vehicles shall comply with all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations including strict adherence to applicable vehicle weight limitations. The successful qualified vendor must determine the design of the EVLC based on defined vehicle performance standards and requirements. 
DOE anticipates a three-step Procurement Process.  Each Step will have a separate evaluation criteria. Only successful vendors who meet the evaluation criteria in each Step would be considered for the successive Steps.  In Step I, vendors will be provided a limited specifications document and asked to provide a proposal that adequately defines key aspects of their business, relevant experience, and capability.  The Proposal shall include a description of the vendors proposed design concept based on their interpretation of the EVLC requirement.  In Step II, qualified vendors will be provided a complete vehicle specification and asked to respond to a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the production of a prototype based on the design concept presented in Step I of the solicitation.  In Step III, the qualified vendor(s) will be awarded a firm fixed price contract for steady-state production of the EVLC vehicle.  Based on available funding, the vendor should expect to deliver up to 6 3 vehicles within a five (5) year period.  Contract performance shall be at vendor facility.
Interested small business concerns should respond to this announcement by providing its company name, address, a point of contact with telephone number and e-mail address, and a statement of capability that includes: (1) an expression of interest, and (2) commercial literature that demonstrates the company's expertise and experience to perform the requirements contained in this Sources Sought Synopsis, no later than November 5th, 2008, 4:00pm EST.  The expression of interest and commercial literature shall be limited to not more than 15 pages, single spaced and Times New Roman 12 pt font.  
Only electronic copies of the expression of interest and commercial literature sent to won.sim@nnsa.doe.gov and a courtesy copy to temidayo.osinuga@nnsa.doe.gov shall be accepted.  Any questions or comments regarding this announcement should be e-mailed to temidayo.osinuga@nnsa.doe.gov.  Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted.
This Sources Sought Synopsis notice is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  Because a solicitation is not being issued at this time, this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. DOE/NNSA will therefore not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.
Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this Sources Sought Synopsis is strictly voluntary and the information obtained from industries responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future request for proposal.  
Please be advised that all information submitted will be considered procurement sensitive and will not be returned.  Information which the vendor considers "Proprietary Information" pursuant to existing laws and regulations must be marked accordingly [see FAR 3.104-1 (3) & (4)].

The power supply needs to provide at least 1000 Watts.  It also needs to be capable of operating in all the environments the gun operates in (-50F to +125F, sealed against rain, dust, etc).  This announcement is to determine if a power supply capable of meeting the above  needs is available.
All interested sources are encouraged to submit their abilities/capabilities no later than 30 days from date of this publication to:  Mr. Paul Fiorello, AMSCC-JML-ET  Bldg. 322, Picatinnny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000; email:  paul.fiorello@us.army.mil  phone:  973-724-5283. Please include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact, brochures/literature, etc., and any prior performance relating to this requirement.

<DESC>The Defense Intelligence Operations Coordination Center (DIOCC) located at the Defense Intelligence Analysis Center (DIAC) Bolling AFB, Washington DC is seeking sources to perform national level intelligence planning in support of combatant commands and defense policy-makers.  

The primary goal for this service support is the development of National Intelligence Support Plans which formally integrate and synchronize national level intelligence support to Combatant Commands Operations Plans.  Activities would include researching, coordinating, staffing, briefing, and facilitating the national intelligence support described above. This desired service would also ensure each plan is integrated and synchronized into theater intelligence activities and is coherent, feasible, and acceptable to the combatant commanders, their intelligence staffs and senior defense decision-makers.  

The contractor will research Combatant Command (COCOM) intelligence requirements and using Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) and COCOM policy and intelligence planning guidance will scope the intelligence planning requirement for coordination among the Combat Support Agencies (CSA) and Service Intelligence Centers (SIC) for the purpose of determining Responsible Analytic Center (RAC) and Collaborative Analytic Center (CAC) assignments.  

Service support would include setting milestones, conducting meetings, preparing NISP base-plan document, editing inputs and staffing the NISP with COCOMs, CSAs, Services, Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Joint Staff, and OSD.  Services require Global travel to survey COCOM intelligence staffs, conduct intelligence planning, participate in theater exercises, as well as travel to local Washington DC area locations.

The Government anticipates releasing a single solicitation from which multiple contracts may be awarded.  Requirements in the solicitation will be divided on a functional basis.  The Government may award as few as one (1) or as many as 3 contracts and anticipates that portions of this requirement will be subject to Full and Open Competition, and small business and 8(a) competitions only.  

The Government anticipates that this effort shall be awarded on a predominantly Firm Fixed Price (FFP) basis.  The Government will make final decisions on the set-asides based on market research and responses from this Request for Information (RFI), as well as other procurement and program related criteria.

Interested parties are requested to provide information on their ability to satisfy any or all of the requirements outlined above.  Information should be provided by electronic mail to Pamela Robinson at pamela.robinson@dia.mil.  

At a minimum, responses should include company name, size of business, point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), and a list of contracts within the past five (5) years under which the interested party has performed the same or similar work.  The deadline for submission of information is 03 November 2008 at 2:30 pm.  

This information is being requested for purposes of market research.  The Government will use this information to develop a list of potential bidders which can be view on this site under interested parties.  Questions concerning this notice should be submitted to Pamela Robinson at pamela.robinson@dia.mil.

<CONTACT>Melissa Prickett, Grants Negotiator, Phone (937) 656-9749, Email Melissa.Prickett@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>1. Subject: The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory seeks information pertaining to the capability of U.S. industry to support the Air Force with the development and experimental validation of hypersonic technologies. In particular, support is sought for the development and flight test evaluation of one or more technology experiments. Respondents are encouraged to provide substantiation for both technical and programmatic approaches. Further, the potential of industry to collaborate with the Air Force through the leverage of existing resources and the provision of new resources is highly desirable.<br />2. Purpose: The purpose of the effort proposed herein is twofold: 1) to develop fundamental hypersonics technologies by resolving basic hypersonic phenomena and 2) to advance the aerospace design database. The product of this effort will be basic science data and performance analyses applicable to the design of next generation high speed strike weapons. The technical data to be collected from this program will be used to extend the verification of current design tools and further Air Force efforts to buy down risk in the development of future weapon systems. Further, this data may be employed to enhance future design and analysis tools that deliver increased accuracy and precision. This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.<br />3. Deliverables: The objective of this RFI is to seek a description of a technical scope and programmatic approach to execute the hypersonic flight experiment as outlined below. The description shall include a notional vehicle geometry, inclusive of an assumed weight and aerodynamic performance; alternative test approaches that will accomplish the science objectives for the flight as outlined below; and a development strategy inclusive of an explanation of how the company would collaborate with AFRL to execute the flight experiment. This explanation shall include an estimate and breakdown of the financial resources and engineering manpower that would be required to execute the effort.<br />4. Background: The proposed research activity is to be executed in coordination with the Air Force's ''Hypersonic International Flight Research and Experimentation (HIFiRE)'' program. The United States Department of Defense (US DoD), as represented by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and the Australian Department of Defence (AS DoD), as represented by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO), have secured authorization under Project Arrangement (PA) Number AF-06-0046 to conduct a $54M joint research and development program entitled "Hypersonic International Flight Research and Experimentation (HIFiRE)". The purpose of this program is to investigate fundamental hypersonic phenomena and accelerate the development of aerospace vehicle technologies deemed critical to long range precision strike. The program is managed by an integrated Program Management Office, addressing the tactical and strategic objectives of both countries. The project will culminate with the development and flight test of ten vehicles. The flight tests are to be launched using sounding rockets to test conditions representative of those to be incurred by hypersonic vehicles. The flight test evaluations will be conducted at the Woomera Prohibited Weapons Test Range in South Australia. The launch of the first experiments, designated Flight 0 Pathfinder experiment and Flight Vehicle 1 aero-sciences experiment, is scheduled for November 2008. These flights will provide principal validation of the experimental strategy. Further, the vehicle system's performance data from these activities will be made available to contractors to support the development of subsequent flights. The two flight tests that are proposed herein will support Air Force goals in basic and applied research in the areas aero-propulsion integration, configuration aerodynamics, and stability and control for air-breathing hypersonic vehicles. The data collected during the flights will aid the development and validation of computational models and design methods for scramjet-powered hypersonic vehicles, and will further be used to characterize and validate the operability predictions of a hypersonic vehicle with integrated aerodynamics and propulsion. The first flight test will investigate inlet on and off-design performance and characterization of the inlet un-starting and re-starting flow physics. This flight test will occur with an unpowered vehicle containing a representative scramjet internal flow path. The assessment of the inlet's off-design performance will simultaneously capture the effects of the inlet and flow path aerodynamics on the stability and control characteristics of the flight test vehicle. The data collected during this portion of the flight experiment shall be used for the characterization of the uncertainties in the vehicle's lift, drag, and stability and control characteristics due to the flow path. Possible secondary test objectives relating to leading edge aerothermodynamics, aerodynamic heating prediction, and the performance of advanced materials and thermal protection systems may be accommodated during the flight test. It is expected that the second flight test will focus on the performance of the integrated airframe and propulsion system.<br />Consistent with the program, a ground launch system consisting of a low-cost, two-stage sounding rocket will boost the test vehicle to the desired test window. The vehicle will then separate from the second stage of the vehicle and continue in free flight under autonomous control for the duration of the flight experiment. As envisioned, the vehicles will be launched on a suppressed trajectory to accommodate a test window that ranges from approximately Mach 5 to Mach 9 to study the operability of the inlet over a range of Mach numbers. It is expected that the first flight test will occur in approximately 2011-2012 time frame. Any follow on flight tests will occur in subsequent years pending the availability of government and/or industry resources to support the manufacture of the flight test vehicles, purchase of the launch system, and the execution of the flight test.<br />1. Vehicle Description: The experimental payload shall be designed to ensure the mission can be effectively executed, and the experimental objectives attained, from launch to the desired test conditions aboard a two-stage Pedro-Oriole class launch system. The flight test vehicle shall incorporate a three-dimensional, streamline-traced inlet that exhibits significant influence on the external aerodynamic characteristics. The vehicle shall also be capable of full three axis control with aerodynamic control surfaces sized to appropriately to minimize trim drag and trim deflection. The vehicle shall also be designed to later accommodate a fuel system in order to support the assessment of integrated propulsion system operability. It is expected that during the execution of this project that neither the vehicle configuration nor the inlet/flowpath will be subjected to ground testing, and that the internal and external aerodynamics and flight dynamics of the vehicle will be determined solely via digital simulation. <br />2. Experiment Sequence: Following separation of the vehicle from the second-stage booster, the flight test vehicle will de-spin to zero degrees roll angle and acquire the test trajectory. The vehicle will execute a series of parameter identification maneuvers in order to study the effects of angle-of-attack and sideslip on the inlet performance and to identify the vehicle's stability and control characteristics. At a pre-determined Mach number, it is tentatively planned to have the vehicle experience a forced unstart of the inlet. The purpose of this event is to collect data on the inlet flow field to study the inlet flow physics during an inlet unstart and re-start, as well as the interaction of the spill flow with the external flow field on the dynamics of the flight test vehicle. The vehicle must remain under controlled flight during this event, and subsequently recover to resume the remainder of the flight test. Once the vehicle recovers and attains the desired flight path, execution of the parameter identification maneuvers will resume until the inlet naturally unstarts as it transitions through its lower operability limit, at which time the experiment will conclude.<br />5. Companies are to adhere to the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) procedures for the transmittal of responses, which are limited to unclassified. Company responses are to include a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with government representatives.

<CONTACT>Margaret M Hunt, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-283-1192, Fax 202-283-0610, Email margaret.m.hunt@irs.gov
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to award a sole source contract to International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) for the Employee User Portal (EUP) and Registered User Portal (RUP) Managed Services.  These services include hosting, and operations and maintenance support for the EUP and RUP.  This announcement is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government believes that there is only one responsible source that can provide the services that satisfy the agency requirements for EUP and RUP Managed Services in the required timeframe, as the IRS is currently engaged in determining the future direction of the portals.  The Government intends to award a fixed price and time and materials contract pursuant to FAR Part 15 under NAICS Code 541512.

Since January 2002, the EUP and RUP have served as the only electronic channel for interactions with the IRS and are currently a pivotal information source for over 120 million taxpayers and tax professionals, as well as IRS employees.  The EUP supports an intranet portal that allows IRS employees to access business applications and data.  The RUP is the IRS internet portal that allows registered individuals, third party users, and other individual taxpayers and their representative to access selected tax processing data, and other sensitive applications.  The Operations and Maintenance (O&M) for the EUP and RUP is currently performed by IBM.  The sites consist of approximately 515 hosting servers/devices located at three external, load-balanced sites (Martinsburg, West Virginia; Sterling, Virginia; and Chicago, Illinois).  At each level of the architecture, redundancy was implemented to meet the high level (100%) of availability required by the IRS.  Employee User and Registered User Portals host some 22 applications/utilities.  

The IRS is in the process of developing a long range strategy for Portal Managed Services.  The current portal hosting infrastructures at the IRS are mission critical systems that cannot be allowed to break or suffer service level degradation.  Since its launch in January 2002, the EUP and RUP have provided 100% availability to IRS employees and the taxpaying public.  The current O&M contract will expire in May 2009.  It is imperative that these IRS public facing portals continue to be maintained and available 24 hours a day/7 days a week.  Some of the challenges prohibiting a competitive acquisition at this time include:

infrastructure ownership implications; software (OS, Tools), Telecommunications, Facilities (Floor, Space, Power, etc.), and Network (each unique component) cannot be transferred timely to another vendor;

knowledge and execution of security complexities in the planned transition to a new service provider; Title III of the E-Government Act, of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347, OMB Circular A-130-NIST provides guidance consistent with the requirements of OMB Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), NIST Special Publications 800 series, TD P 85-01, Department of Treasury Security Manual, TD P 84-01, Information System Life Cycle (ISLC),TD P 83-01, Guidelines for Acquiring Federal Information Processing, TD P 71-10, Department of Treasury Security Manual and Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) 10.8 Series;

completion of the portal strategy analysis that will determine the technical direction of the EUP and RUP;

disruption in service would result in both internal and external complications; user applications would not have a platform to operate.

Given the complexity, mission criticality, and transitional requirements of the IRS portals, the IRS estimates the need for a sole-source contract, with the incumbent, consisting of one base year and 3 one year option periods.  This will ensure sufficient time to: 1) complete the IRS Portal Strategic Analysis including the submission and acceptance of all of the final deliverables, leading to IRS ability to conduct a competitive acquisition for future portal requirements; 2) develop a procurement strategy that implements the future direction of the portals and promotes competition to the maximum extent practicable; and, 3) successfully complete transition of all existing applications to the new portal infrastructure with no disruption of service during the transition period.  

No solicitation document is available, and requests for same will be considered non-responsive.  However, any firm that believes that it can meet the requirements above may give written notification to the contracting officer; firms must submit clear and convincing data in writing substantiating an ability to furnish the entire requirement.  Responses may not exceed ten pages.  Responses to this notice must be received by this office by November 5, 2008.  Responses should be sent to:  Internal Revenue Service, Office of Procurement, 6009 Oxon Hill Road, Oxon Hill, MD  20745, Attn:  Margaret M. Hunt, OS:A:P:I:F:B.  Responses will be accepted by facsimile at 202-283-4427.  If a response is received that meets the IRS requirements, and analysis of both technical and pricing documentation indicate that a competitive acquisition would be more advantageous to the Government, a formal solicitation may be issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Telephonic or e-mail inquiries will not be accepted.  The reference number for this announcement is Q9Q63KSIC01000.  If no compelling responses are received, award will be made to IBM.

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY FOR THE A/E32K-11 MUNITIONS LIFTING ASSEMBLY (MLA)

The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst, NJ plans to host an Industry Day on 13 November 2008, at Beale Air Force Base, California, in order to present information about an upcoming effort to procure the design, development, fabrication, and testing of the USMC Munitions Lifting Assembly (MLA), Model Designation A/E32K-11.  The A/E32K-11 will consist of four major assemblies including the on-load gantry, the rail conveyor, the off-load gantry and the interface control board.

THIS IS AN INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. 

The purpose of this Industry Day is to familiarize potential sources with the MLA requirements. The Government will provide an overview of the MLA program and its acquisition strategy. 

This Industry Day Announcement is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This Industry Day Announcement does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this announcement nor will the Government compensate any respondent for incurred costs associated with attending the Industry Day.

Vendors interested in attending this Industry Day are requested to provide the following information by November 4, 2008 via email to Michael Manaresi at michael.manaresi@navy.mil with a copy to Neil Davis at neil.davis@navy.mil.  

1.	Company name, address and phone number;
2.	Name(s) and title of personnel attending;
3.	Social security number;
4.	Date of birth; and
5.	Place of birth (city & state).  

The subject line of your email response shall read:  MLA Industry Day.  Attendees should plan to arrive between 0830 and 0900.  Industry Day will begin at 0900.

Not responding to this announcement shall not preclude participation in any future RFP. Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.

The objective of this potential procurement is to replace the current USMC Munitions Assembly Conveyor (MAC) Model Designation A/E32K-3, P/N: 8457540-10, NSN: 6RD-1730-01-202-5141 with a new munitions assembly conveyor system that is improved and compatible with the A/M32K-10 Universal Rough Terrain Munitions Trailer and the MTVR MK 23, 25, 27, & 28 series tactical vehicles.

The MLA will provide a mobile capability to rapidly assemble/disassemble conventional munitions and provide a means to load/unload to/from a munitions trailer.  During operation, the munitions components are brought to the on load gantry, placed on the rail conveyor for assembly and progress to the offload gantry where the complete assemblies are removed and transported to the flight line.  The unit is required to be disassembled for transport from base to base as mission locations change.  An external maintenance trailer will provide electrical power and pressurized air to power the MLA.

This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or commitment of any kind.

<p>CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS <br />(a) The contractor acknowledges that this contract is an important part of the U.S. Foreign Assistance <br />Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities that this entails. <br />(b) While in the Cooperating Country, the contractor is expected to show respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the Cooperating Country and not interfere in its political affairs.<br /><br />(c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph (b) of this provision, the contract may be unilaterally terminated by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor recognizes the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her immediate removal from any country when, in the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require.<br /><br />(d) The Country Director is the chief representative of CDC in the Cooperating Country. In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total CDC Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising CDC regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program. The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract.

The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such case, the contractor would be eligible for contributions under paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) as appropriate.<br /><br />(4) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid.

CDC shall reimburse 100% of the cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtains coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/health/health_1185.html. CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. In order for CDC to reimburse the cost of medevac insurance, CDC shall require the contractor to furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders and its cost, after issuance of an offer letter.</p>

<DESC>Narrow-Gap Improved Electroslag Welding of High Performance Steel for Bridges
A. Background
ASTM A709, Grade 70W high performance steel is being increasingly used for bridges in the United States. The Narrow Gap Improved Electroslag Welding process  (ESW-NG) developed under long term research sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration, developed in the 1980's and 1990's for welding conventional A36 and A588 structural steels is a greatly improved modification of conventional consumable guide electroslag welding. This research was conducted at the Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI), Beaverton, OR (FHWA technical report on ESW-NG; Number FHWA/RD-87/026, available from the Sales Department of the National Technical Information Service, telephone number 703-605-6000 or 800-553-6847, publication number PB89211056).  ESW-NG results in major increases in productivity in an already high productivity welding process, virtually eliminates weld defects, increases process reliability, and improves both weld metal and heat affected zone impact toughness. Fatigue tests on I-Beams demonstrated excellent fatigue properties.  
The previous research and the demonstrations that followed the research were limited to conventional steels.  Now, with the advent of high performance steels, there is an urgent need to determine whether or not Narrow Gap-Improved Electroslag (ESW-NG) welding process could be allowed for joining High Performance Steel (HPS) also.  The previously developed ESW-NG process consumables and welding conditions may have to be modified for joining HPS to ensure that welded joints thus made will be defect free and will have adequate strength and toughness in both the weld metal and heat-affected zones of the welded joints. 
The assessment of the weldment properties that can be achieved through the integration of both these new technologies, steel production and high productivity joining, needs to be carried out to determine the potential for, and the benefits of, ESW-NG  applied to HPS 70W.  The lack of preheating requirements, the extremely high weld productivity, and the cost effectiveness in thicknesses over 25 mm are strong drivers for use of the technology. Effective use of shop floor space and reduced plate handling also enhance fabrication efficiency.
The consumable development, while designed for conventional steels, will use the same wire  chemistry principles as those applied to welding HPS Gr 70W - low carbon and the use of Ni-Mo-Mn to develop high weld metal toughness and matching strength, while minimizing carbon content. The consumable chemistry will likely need to be slightly modified in order to match the 70 ksi strength level, since the weld metal strength for ESW-NG of A588 using the current weld metal chemistry is typically 68,000psi. and since the weld metal carbon content for A588 is typically around 0.09wt % carbon (after dilution from the base metal) and the carbon content for ESW-NG Gr70 is expected to be as low as 0.05wt %C. Some adjustment in the Ni-Mn- Mo levels can be anticipated in order to achieve a yield strength of between 72,000 psi and 74,000 psi. The second area of concentration will be to reduce the heat input to as low a level as can be practically and consistently achieved in order to maximize the heat affected zone properties.

C. Objectives
The primary objectives of this basic/applied research are to apply and extend ESW-NG practices and consumable development for application to HPS 70W. The two technical areas of concentration will be (1) evaluating consumable chemistry requirements and the resulting weld metal chemistry to achieve (a) a minimum 70 ksi strength level and (b) a weld metal microstructure with the maximum level of impact toughness, and (2) process modifications that will reduce the heat input to a minimum level that can be consistently and practically achieved in a production environment. For both objectives the starting baseline point of comparison will be the current wire chemistry and the current baseline recommended welding process parameters.
D. Requirements
Technical Approach
The Contractors  proposal shall delineate a technical approach taking into consideration of weld metal chemistry, grain structure and metallurgy and heat input which may influence mechnical properties of the weldment and heat affected zones (HAZ). Because there are a number of  variables that can influence heat input which can influence HAZ microstructure and properties, the technical approach and the assessment will be to maximize the mechanical properties. The assessment of the weld quality and HAZ should include the following factors at a minimum:
(1)	Application of  a thin metal sheath for the tubular metal powder cored electrode wire

(2)	Application of  multiple 1/16" diameter electrode wire rather than the typical single 3/32" diameter wire:

(3)	Application of multiple electrodes (2 versus 1) in order to reduce the current density for each wire

(4)	Increasing the water cooling effectiveness of the retaining shoes by increasing the water flow rate and by reducing the incoming water temperature 

The Government anticipates an approach which would focus on optimizing tensile properties and impact toughness while maintaining - consistency, reliability, defect free, and demonstrated fatigue behavior. 
Standards for the evaluation of test welds and specimens shall be consistent with tests required by the current AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code procedures and as noted below:
	Transverse Tensile Tests
	All Weld Metal Tensile Tests
	Radiographic Tests (RT) and Ultrasonic Tests (UT)
	Bend tests
	Weld metal and Heat Affected Zone Hardness Tests
	Weld metal Charpey V Notch (CVN) (8) mid thickness
	Heat Affected zone CVN (5) quarter thickness
weld and heat affected zone  macro and microstructure analysis
Additional analysis beyond standard D1.5 protocols will include weld metal chemistry.
The Government anticipates that initial weld samples shall be evaluated primarily for weld integrity, weld cross section profile, and dilution, rather than for tensile strength and toughness   and the full complement of D1.5 weld evaluation methods to fully evaluate the optimized HPS Gr 70W weldment  including HPS Gr70W to conventional structural steel, such as A588, hybrid weldments. 
The thickness of the weldments will be dependent on the available test plate material. Suitable  thicknesses range from about 38 mm (1.5") to 100 mm (4") thick.  Since HPS Gr. 70W is not available in 100 mm (4) thickness, the Government anticipates that the Contractor shall make hybrid weldments using conventional steel up to 100mm (4) plate and the second plate up to 76 mm(3) HPS Gr70W.  The exact thickness shall be proposed by the Contractor based on the plate availability and as approval by the Government.  For estimating purposes two plate thicknesses are anticipated.
It is anticipated that the Contractor shalll conduct optimization development of welds, including required weld analysis resulting in a weld procedure designed to minimize heat input levels to the lowest practical level. and electrode and consumable guide chemistry modification resulting in ESW-NG welds that meet minimum tensile properties for HPS Gr70W. The Contractor shalll conduct detailed impact toughness tests on fully optimized welds per proposed AASHTO/AWS D1.5 specifications for ESW-NG.  Also, the Contractor shall evaluate mechanical properties of HPS optimized ESW-NG for hybrid welds (joining HPS to conventional steel).  All test results, findings and recommendations shall be compiled in a report. The Government may post this report on the FHWA Web site.  The contractor shall strictly follow FHWA Web posting protocols and 508 compliance. 
The Government anticipates a kick-off meeting and has capability of Web conferencing.  Kick-off Web conference meeting shall be to seek directions from the COTR and the FHWA advisory group. The FHWA Web conferencing services will be used at no cost to the Contractor.  The Contractor shall prepare a power point presentation and other necessary visuals to discuss the proposed work plan including a detailed (time) schedule for the test program. 
Based on the directions provided by the advisory group and upon approval by the Government, the Contractor shall update the work plan.  After the kick-off meeting, the following shall be provided to the CO and to the COTR:
(1)	Hard copy of the work plan 
(2)	Electronic copy of the work plan
(3)	The Contractor shall provide minutes of the meeting.  The COTR may post these minutes on the FHWA Web site.  The contractor will strictly follow FHWA Web posting protocols and 508 compliance. 

Test Matrix and Optimization of ESW-NG for HPS Gr70W 

The Government anticipates that the Contractor shall develop a test matrix consistent with the proposed research approach to produce sound optimized welds with tensile strength of that required for HPS Gr70W steel.   The number of weldments and conditions considered in the test matrix will be rationalized by the contractor.  
Web meetings with the FHWA Advisory Group

The Government anticipates that the Contractor shall utilize Web conference(s) (Web meetings).  The FHWA Web conferencing services shall be used at no cost to the Contractor to present to the COTR and the FHWA advisory Group power point presentation(s) and other necessary visuals to discuss the research progress, test program results, research findings and recommendations including any modifications to the test program.

Based on the directions provided by the advisory group and upon approval by the Government, after each web meeting, the Contractor shall update the test program and the work plan.  Following the Web conference(s) meeting(s), the following shall be provided to the CO and the COTR, as applicable:

(1)   Hard copy of the revised test program including modified test matrix and the updated work plan.

(2)  Electronic copy of the updated work plan and updated power point slides (maximum 36 slides) suitable for posting on the FHWA Web site for dissemination of the related technical information among State DOTs, industries and other users.
 
(3)   The Contractor will provide minutes of the meeting.  The COTR may post these minutes on the FHWA Web site.  The contractor will strictly follow FHWA Web posting protocols and 508 compliance.

After receipt, the final procedures for ESW-NG on HPS will be subject to peer or scientific review.

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a need for initial and continued ISO Certification to the ISO 9000:2008, ISO 20000-1:2005 and ISO 27001:2005 standards. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

Potential offerors shall see attached items and below for further details regarding this acquisition.

Evaluation Factors
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government shall make an award to the offeror that submits the LOWEST PRICED TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) proposal.  Technical acceptability shall be determined against the minimum specifications set forth in the attached Statement of Work entitled, "National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, Enterprise Operations Directorate, Statement of Work for ISO 9000:2008, ISO 20000-1:2005 and ISO 27001:2005 ISO Certification Services."

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Offerors shall submit proposals inclusive of a Technical Volume and a Cost Volume (Prime cost proposal and if applicable an un-sanitized cost proposal of proposed Subcontractors), no later than 5:00pm EST, Tuesday, 05 NOVEMBER 2008. Proposals shall be valid up to 90 days.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The items specified above represent a follow on to previous contracts with Eclypse International Corporation.  The purposed contract action is for services for commercial items, which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or other costs incurred in response to this announcement. See Note 22. 
Notice for filing agency protests: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that an Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

TITLE:  Market Survey for Center Operations & Maintenance - Eight Major Trade Areas, for the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ
The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (Tech Center) has a continuing requirement for services that were previously procured on a single contract, DTFACT-04-C-00014, awarded to All Star Services, Inc.  This contract expires on September 30, 2009.  One of the FAA's fundamental procurement principles is to provide attainable and reasonable opportunities for small businesses.  This announcement seeks to survey and assess the current marketplace for small businesses that are capable of performing any one of the eight major trade area services listed in Table 1, attached.  
This market survey will aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside any of the requirements, listed on Table 1, for small business when the RFO follows. Responses to this announcement will be used to determine competition level and whether sufficient competition exists to set aside any of the eight major trade requirements for small business, for small, economically-disadvantaged (SEDB) firms; Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) of for very small businesses.  
Background:  Work to be done at the Tech Center covers 5000 acres, includes approximately 125 buildings, utility distribution systems, motor vehicles, and roads and grounds.  The Center contracts out nearly all its facility operations and maintenance work to private contractors, except for a small amount of work done by the Center's in-house shops.  
The current contract is a hybrid contract of fixed price work (namely operation and maintenance of the central utility plant and water treatment plant, scheduled preventive maintenance and servicing of installed equipment--approximately 15,000 items), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) time and materials and cost-plus fixed fee (such as for emergency repair of storm damage, or trash and hazardous waste removal and disposal).  Included in separate contracts and not part of this market survey are custodial/janitorial services, security guards and cafeteria operations.
The Center's COMS contract includes servicing of some of the tenant-owned facilities located on the campus.  Servicing of facilities owned and paid for by others is distinguished from Center facilities, and financed by the tenants.  Full servicing is currently provided for the FAA's Eastern Region Air Traffic Control Tower, Transportation Security laboratories and the Federal Air Marshall's training and administrative facilities; selective servicing is performed for the US Coast Guard and NJ Air National Guard.
The complete announcement is attached.Also attached are the Business Declaration Form and Table 1.

<DESC>1.0 Introduction

The Military Sealift Command (MSC) intends to purchase new, dedicated Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) davits to safely handle the RHIB on board the T-AGS 60 Class vessels.  The RHIBs on board the T-AGS Class are currently stowed port side on the 02 level at Frame 115 and deployed/retrieved by the ship service crane. Using the ship service crane can be hazardous and is not the preferred method for handling a RHIB.  This survey in no way commits the Government to purchase any products or services from responding vendors.  The information contained in the resulting solicitation may differ from this initial description.

Interested vendors are requested to address and supply the following:

1.  Name of organization with telephone/fax numbers, and name, email address, and mailing address of primary point of contact.

2.  Brief description of your organizations capabilities.

3.  Organizations business size status (e.g., large or small business, specific category of small business).

4.  Description and specifications (size, materials, etc.) of recommended davit.

5.  Provide any additional comments regarding the requirements.  


2.0 Background

There are six T-AGS 60 Class Oceanographic Survey Ships built for the U.S. Navy.    These ships are designed and constructed to provide multi-purpose oceanographic capabilities in coastal and deep ocean areas.  The ships are equipped with three (3) multi-purpose cranes, one (1) articulated davit, and five (5) types of winches which aid in mission performance.  The handling gear is capable of overside operations which include the carrying, launching, and recovering of equipment on the starboard side from midship to stern.   Drawings indicating potential locations for the davit are attached.


3.0 Scope

One davit will be required per vessel (6 davits total). 

The following provides the RHIB particulars to be handled by the davit: 

MFR and Model: Zodiac Hurricane Model 590 OB 
Length Overall: 5.8 m (19'-0") 
Length of Rigid Hull: 4.47 m (14'-8") 
Beam Overall: 2.44 m (8'-0") 
Beam Over Rigid Hull: 1.5 m (5'-0") 
Hoisting Weight without Crew: 818 kg (1800 lb) 
Hoisting Weight with Two Crew Approx: 980 kg (2160 lb)

It is the intent to supply one (1) davit for each vessel so that the RHIB will no longer need to be deployed via the ships service crane.

4.0 Requirements

4.1 Applicable Specifications

The davits shall be Electro-Hydraulic pivoting or gravity davit types and shall be U.S. Coast Guard approved and Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) compliant. The davits shall be capable of being located in multiple locations and attached to the vessel deck using existing 610 mm x 610 mm (24 x 24) recessed deck bolt holes with 25.4 mm (1&#1524;) bolts.  It is desired that the davit and foundation (skid) have the capability to be moved by fork truck and the ship service crane.


It is requested that the above information be provided no later than 4:00 PM on 06 NOVEMBER 2008.  Responses should be faxed to (202) 685-5965.  The points of contact for this action are Ms. Marilyn May at (202) 685-5953 or marilyn.may@navy.mil and Mrs. Stefani Nick at (202) 685-5962 or stefani.nick@navy.mil.

<DESC>Performance Work Statement

1.  SCOPE:
a.	The contract will obtain the services of a trucking company to pick up an estimated annual demand of 10,000 gallons of potassium chromate solution in the unclassified area of the Controlled Industrial Area (CIA) at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Industrial Maintenance Facility (PSNS&IMF), 1400 Farragut Ave, Bremerton, WA   98314 (west of Building 1110) and deliver the commodity to Northrop Grumman Newport News (NGNN) Shipyard in Newport News, VA.  The material is a hazardous material per Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations.  The contractor will provide the tanks to haul the material.   
b.	The volume of each shipment is expected to exceed the allowable axle weights for a single tank; therefore, each shipment volume will be divided about equally between two (2) tanks; about 5,000 gallons in each tank for a 10,000 gallon shipment.  The tanks for each shipment are expected to arrive at the PSNS&IMF security gate on two (2) consecutive days.  Shipyard security and escort personnel will meet the tanks and drivers upon arrival at PSNS&IMF.  Once the drivers and tanks have cleared security, they will be escorted to Building 1110 and spotted for loading.  
c.	The loading procedures require that PSNS&IMF inspect the tanks and confirm that they meet DOT requirements as well as other requirements specified herein prior to loading the tanks.  PSNS&IMF employees will connect the transfer system to the tanks and load the solution into the tanks using the tank bottom fill connection.  
d.	PSNS&IMF expects the bottom fill connection to be a 3" male coupling half meeting the requirements of Figure 2 of Commercial Item Description A-A-59326B "Coupling Halves, Quick-Disconnect, Cam-Locking Type".  PSNS&IMF will have the mating 3" female coupling half and associated adapters to connect to PSNS&IMF's loading hose.   Other bottom fill connections may be acceptable upon agreement with PSNS&IMF and confirmation that suitable adapters are available.
e.	The driver and tank will be escorted out of the Shipyard once loading operations are complete.  Loading operations at the Shipyard should take a maximum of one day for every 5,000 gallons loaded in a single tank.
f.	The shipment is to meet the delivery requirements of paragraph 5 of the potassium chromate solution to NGNN Shipyard.  As such, it is expected that the tanks will be unloaded at NGNN, rinsed, and returned to the trucking company within eighteen (18) days of arrival at NGNN. If the allotted eighteen (18) days to unload the tanks at NGNN is expected to be exceeded, the trucking company will be notified.  The contractor has responsibility for the commodity during transit and NGNN will assume responsibility upon receipt at NGNN. NGNN is responsible for rinsing the emptied tanker before it leaves their shipyard.  g.	The contractor's proposal shall include the cost for transit from PSNS&IMF to NGNN, four (4) days of time for the drivers to stay with the tanks at NGNN, a maximum of 14 days demurrage charges, and return transit to the vendor's distribution center.
h.	Any driver for use under this contract effort shall be a U.S. citizen.

2.  Material MSDS:  D157XX  (see Attachment 0002)
Copy of MSDS will be provided to the hauler along with the hazardous materials manifest when material is shipped and shall stay with shipment to destination.

<DESC>The description of the work involved in this procurement has changed significantly. The new description changes as follows:<BR>MINNEHAHA CREEK WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION (WPA) WALLS--CAP SECTION 14-- MINNEAPOLIS, MN. This project includes stabilizing approximately 1390 linear feet of the historic WPA walls, including excavating material under the walls to get to a solid base and then fill the void with pumped reinforced concrete. In areas where the void exists, large caissons will be drilled into the bedrock to provide support. For a 100 foot area where the walls have sloughed down, the walls will be removed and a concrete 'T' wall with a facade will be construction from Platteville limestone recovered from the creek. Site access will occur from the downstream end of the project areas and will be completely within the Minnehaha Creek Park which is all public land.<BR>

<DESC>Program Objectives and Description:The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) announces interest in research and development of persistent airborne Close Air Support (CAS) of ground Troops in Contact (TIC).  The area of interest includes new ideas and innovative approaches to rapidly mature proven technologies to a production readiness state, as well as applications of existing COTS-NDI solutions that may be integrated onto an existing airframe.  Operational considerations include austere fields, small support crew, minimal aircrew, low weight and drag.  Primary interest is in the following areas, listed in descending order of priority:
Fire Control Systems (Integrated-Stand Alone)
Battle-Mission Management
Integrated Air-Ground Picture (IAGP):
Cooperative Engagement Capability    
- Sensor Correlation-Evaluation
- Simulation and Modeling
- Command, Control, and Communications
- Network Centric Operations
- System Interoperability
- Other Applicable IAP Technologies
- Data, Sensor, Display Fusion  
Day-Night and Active-Passive Sensors
Target Identification-Recognition 
Weapons-Warhead Accuracy-Lethality
Precision Guided Munitions, Launchers
Guns, Mounts
Human or Machine Interface 
Communications (Local, Global)
Other applicable technologies

Teaming is encouraged.  An offeror may submit more than one concept aligned with the technologies listed above.  Responses are requested from any responsible US organizations including those from private industry, academic institutions, research institutions and non-profit organizations.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM.  

Responses:  Interested parties are invited to submit a white paper for preliminary consideration.  White papers may be submitted at any time after issuance of this BAA up to the expiration date of the BAA.  Successful responses should segment their studies into an initial 8 month or shorter Phase 1 to explore and validate the technical feasibility of the concept, and one or more additional phases as optional efforts culminating in technology demonstration.  The total effort including options should not exceed 24 months.  Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases.

Format: The form and format for white papers follows below.  White papers that do not satisfy these form and format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation.  All submissions should be in the English language.  White papers should be submitted electronically; a paper copy is not required. Electronic copies should be in PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word.  

White Paper Preparation: A white paper should be a brief summary.  It introduces the idea, solicits interaction with government, and avoids the expense of generating proposals that have little likelihood of selection or award within this BAA.  White papers should summarize the planned proposal and clearly articulate the innovative concept or technology development and demonstration being proposed.  White papers should contain a cover sheet (clearly marked White Paper), a ten page (maximum) summary of the technical idea, a one-page cost summary, and a one-paragraph (150-200 words) abstract of the white paper as a whole.  All pages should be printable on 8.5 by 11 inch paper; type not smaller than 12 point.  The page limitations for white papers include all figures, tables, and charts.  No formal transmittal letter is required.  White papers shall not include classified information. 

WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION WITH PROPRIETARY DATA: When an offeror must include proprietary data in order to fully communicate their concept, the offeror must clearly mark and identify any proprietary data that the offeror intends to be used only by the Government for evaluation purposes.  The offeror must also identify any technical data contained in the white paper that it is furnishing to the Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure.  In the absence of such identification, the Government will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data in the white paper.  Records or data bearing one of the DFARS-approved restrictive legends may be included in the white paper.  It is the intent of the Government to treat all white papers as privileged information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.

The offerors are cautioned, however, that portions of the white papers may be subject to release under terms of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.

NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor, which is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by USSOCOM from non-Government consultants and experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Non-Government technical consultants will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as GOVERNMENT ONLY. Evaluations and selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators.


Submittal address: All white papers should be sent electronically to:  Maj Brady Hauboldt, USSOCOM, SOAL-FW, (813) 826-9390, brady.hauboldt@socom.mil.  White papers received by USSOCOM but not submitted specifically to the BAA may not be considered under the BAA.

Evaluation and Notification: Acknowledgment of receipt of all white papers will be made. White papers will not be returned.  White papers will be evaluated based on the relevance to the SOF mission.  The initial screening will minimize unnecessary effort and expense in any subsequent proposal preparation and review.  Favorable response to a white paper is not an assurance that a full proposal on the white paper's topic will ultimately be selected for contract award.  

Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the technology objectives rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  The following factors are to be considered in the evaluation of white papers received under this BAA.  Listed in descending order of importance: 1) potential contribution to CAS-TIC mission; 2) likelihood of transition to the military if technically successful; 3) offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort; 4) overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and demonstration approach; 5) project plan; and 6) cost and cost realism.  All proposals must first be deemed acceptable under criteria (1) to receive a full technical review.  

The BAA will remain open for submissions for 12 months from the date of posting.  Submissions received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated.  USSOCOM will review and respond to each white paper on a quarterly basis; however reserves to right to review and respond as submissions are submitted.  Upon completion of the evaluation, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has merit and will be considered for award as funds become available, or 2) the proposal does not contain sufficient relevance to the SOF mission to be of interest to the command.  

Awards: Funds are currently available for multiple awards.  An invitation to submit a full proposal will be made to offerors on the basis of the white paper evaluation criteria above and program balance to provide best value to the Government.  Awards will be subject to the availability of funds.  Award instruments may take the form of a procurement contract, grant, or agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  All work beyond Phase I shall be submitted as options.  An estimated cost for options beyond Phase I must be included or the options will not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to 1) select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received, and 2) incrementally fund any award instrument.  All awards made as a result of this BAA will require the awardee to deliver a final technical report (as a minimum) at the end of the contract and or options.  The government will have unlimited data rights to all information and  products generated under contracts that result from this BAA.

Classified Submissions: White paper and proposal submissions in response to this BAA should be kept UNCLASSIFIED.  If classified information is expected to result from any contract, the offeror shall notify USSOCOM in the white paper or proposal.
  
Organizational Conflict of Interest:  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any government technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then the offeror shall so state in the affirmation.

Administration: USSOCOM will reply to questions relating to this BAA and will make replies to questions of general interest available to prospective offerors.  All correspondence including questions and requests for access to the replies to the questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to one of the addresses below.  USSOCOM prefers to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding this BAA.  The address for this BAA are: EMail:  brady.hauboldt@socom.mil.  Mail: U.S. Special Operations Command, 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621. Point of Contact:  Maj Brady Hauboldt, (813) 826-9390.
