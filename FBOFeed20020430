THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-02-00243 and the  solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This quote will be awarded as a result of a Simplified Acquisition with Full and Open Competition.  This procurement is NOT a small business set-aside.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, North  Carolina, is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing teflon filters of high purity to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  The teflon filters are used with a sampler to collect PM-2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5  micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks.  EPA obtains the filters each year from a filter manufacturer and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing.  The filters for a specific  year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution to the States.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM), in conjunction with the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division's Contracting Office, has a requirement to provide Helicopter Pilot Training Services for the U. S. Army Aviation Center's (USAAVNC) "Flight School XXI", located at Ft. Rucker, AL.  The "market research" conducted under FedBizOpps posting dated 12 Dec 2001, (Reference RFI-HT2, "69 - U.S. Army Aviation Training - Innovative Business Solutions/Training Approaches to Flight Simulation Training for Flight School XXI") is now complete. A ten (10) year "Award Term" Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity "Requirements" contract, with the possibility of earning five (5) additional years, is the contemplated acquisition strategy for Flight School XXI. 

The successful Flight School XXI service contractor will be responsible for providing all equipment, providing operational and logistical support, and implementing technology upgrades and ensuring that trained helicopter pilots remain current with the latest aircraft HW/SW configuration.  A Cancellation Ceiling will not be included in the Request for Proposal (RFP) or incorporated into the resultant contract.  The target Flight School XXI contract award date is expected to be Jan 2003.  In the interest of involving industry in the acquisition process, interested offerors are asked to provide a draft Statement of Objective (SOO) and/or any draft RFP Sections: B, L and/or M to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) to assist in developing the formal Statement of Work/RFP.  All draft materials should be received by the PCO not later than 23 May 2002 and should not include any "business sensitive" information, as the Government intends to discuss draft submissions during a "Pre-Solicitation Conference" to be held on or about 11 June 2002 in Orlando, FL.  Issuance of a formal RFP will follow, with a "Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Survey" to be held during September 2002. 

More detailed information regarding the Flight School XXI  requirement (e.g., helicopter training manuals, aviation training manuals, facility blueprints, etc.) can be found under the "Sources Sought" page found on the World Wide Web at: www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=stricom&men=OPA 

All respondents interested in participating in the Flight School XXI acquisition are requested to provide the following information: 

(1) Provide your business size in relation to NAICS Code 541330 (SIC Code 8711) size standard of $20M.  Also state if you are a small, small/disadvantaged, or certified 8(a) business, or other socioeconomic program. 
   
(2) State your interest as either a prime or sub contractor.  

Based upon "market research" conclusions, this acquisition is contemplated to be a full and open, negotiated acquisition, with the contract award based upon a best value "trade-off analysis". However, to assist the Government in establishing set-aside possibilities (FAR 19.5), small businesses are requested to provide their firm's specific capabilities to perform Flight Simulator Logistic services (e.g. technical expertise, personnel and managerial qualifications, past experience with similar services, proposed teaming arrangements, hardware/software capabilities, financial capabilities, etc.).

Interested parties should provide the above requested information not later than 23 May 2002 to the attention of Larry Grauert, PCO, and Jack Rowe, alternate PCO, at:  Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, Code 25736, 12350 Research Pkwy, Orlando, FL 32826-3275; or via e-mail to:  Larry_Grauert@stricom.army.mil, and Jack_Rowe@stricom.army.mil.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), National Institute of Justice (NIJ) attends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to the University of Virginia, Systems Engineering (UVA SysE) Department, Charlottesville, Virginia 22906.  This order with UVA SysE will consist primarily of consulting that will result in the implementation of a spatial data repository.  UVA SysE shall establish a data repository; continue development of  a repository database structure and the data access tools; conduct usability analysis and make suggested revisions; and create a transferable data repository method, software, and data structure. This project is a continuation of a (Phase I) prototypical project completed in FY2001 under a previous purchase order.  The UVA SysE Capstone Team is uniquely qualified because of their specialized training in developing data warehouses in practical settings and the experience gained from working on the previous project.  In addition, the UVA SysE department has unique experience and expertise in developing spatial data analysis interfaces that will help to inform this effort.  The training and experience of this team makes them uniquely qualified to provide these services resulting in a spatial repository.  The agency feels that changing contractors at this point would increase costs due to an extended timeline and decrease productivity due to the need to transfer knowledge gained in phase one of this project.  This purchase order shall be negotiated in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 2152(c)(1) ? Only One Responsible Source with Unique Capabilities.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.

<DESC>The Public Health Service (PHS),  Office of the Secretary (OS), Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), through the Program Support Center (PSC) intends to award a 6 month sole source simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 13 (under $100,000) to Medical Care Management Corporation (MCMC) in Bethesda, Maryland.  OHRP implements the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations for the protection of human subjects.  OHRP's Division of Education and Development fulfills the requirements of Public Law 99-158, Section 491(b) to "establish a program within the Department of Health and Human Services under which requests for clarification and guidance with respect to ethical issues raised in connection with biomedical or behavioral research involving human subjects are responded to promptly and appropriately."  As part of that mandate, OHRP engages in a variety of efforts to educate the various constituencies concerned about the ethical conduct of human subject research, including: institutions that engage in human subjects research, institutional review boards, researchers, research participants, and the general public.  One of these efforts is conducted by responding to e-mail inquiries received in OHRP's general e-mail mailbox.  At the present time, this is done on an ad hoc basis where every inquiry is responded to by the creation of de novo narrative designed to address the specific inquiry.  The development and deployment of a new, computer-based interactive resource/repository of OHRP guidance will help facilitate OHRP's ability to carry out this part of its statutory and regulatory mandate. MCMC provided consultant services for Phase I of this project.   Phase-I of the project identified the need to develop an official customer service plan and strategy (including an evaluation/communications quality improvement (CQI) component), and information/communication strategy to implement such plan, and a taxonomy/coding scheme for OHRP guidance, to improve the existing email response system (and, to the extent relevant, telephone and mail) inquiry/response systems within the limits of existing information technology, and to coordinate various OHRP initiatives such as the website redesign to ensure their compatibility with the envisioned interactive resource repository (IRR)/interactive resource repository system (IRRS). An appropriate taxonomy of OHRP guidance, and a corresponding coding scheme, are critical for improving the existing email inquiry/response system, and for the successful implementation of the envisioned IRR/IRRS. Such coding scheme would make guidance information more accessible to users.  As a result of the findings of Phase I, continuation services for the design, development, and deployment of an interactive resource/ repository of OHRP guidance be developed under Phase II.  MCMC is uniquely qualified to continue these services due to their intimate knowledge of the project and findings of Phase I and their expertise in substance of human subjects protection.  This proposed requirement for which the Government intends to solicit only one source is under the authority of of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the required services within 10 days of publication of this notice .  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation is available; therefore, requests for such document will be considered invalid responses.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received, the Contracting Officer will proceed to issue a purchase order to Medical Care Management Corporation.  Responses must be in writing and refer to 02T999925 to the attention of Marisha Foreman.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) seeks offers to continue operation of the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (the Registry). The Public Health Service Act, Section 379, mandates the Registry to facilitate unrelated bone marrow transplantation by matching patients with volunteer unrelated donors. Successful marrow transplants require a close match of tissue types between patient and donor. The Act requires the Registry, among other things, to: (1) establish and maintain a Board of Directors that meets certain compositional requirements; (2) establish and manage a system for finding marrow donors suitably matched to unrelated patients who need a marrow transplant; (3) conduct public education activities regarding the availability of unrelated donor transplants facilitated by the Registry and the need for additional donors; (4) recruit and conduct tissue typing of potential marrow donors; (5) maintain a nationwide registry of potential volunteer donors and a scientific registry of recipients of unrelated donor transplants; (6) establish standards for tissue typing, donor selection criteria, and procedures for marrow collection and transportation; (7) collect, analyze and publish data pertinent to unrelated donor marrow transplantation and the operation of the Registry, including data concerning patient outcomes at each transplant center; (8) provide advocacy and case management services to patients and donors; and (9) conduct other activities to increase marrow donation and the success of unrelated donor marrow transplants, and to reduce the differences in the chances of finding a matched donor between Caucasians and other population groups.

The Registry currently maintains formal agreements with numerous organizations in the U.S. and other countries, including 136 transplant centers, 91 donor centers, 16 foreign cooperative registries, 9 recruitment groups, 90 apheresis centers, 110 marrow collection centers, 11 cord blood banks, 22 laboratories, and 3 tissue repositories. The Registry contains 4.6 million volunteer potential donors. Each year, the Registry conducts approximately 8,000 searches for donors and facilitates nearly 2,000 transplants, many of them involving foreign donors or patients. The Registry must comply with Section 379 of the Public Health Service Act and other pertinent Federal requirements related to informed consent, confidentiality and privacy, data collection and publication, and computer security. The Registry submits proposed international agreements to HRSA for submission to the Department of State for clearance. Federal funding of the Registry began in 1987 with a grant from the Department of the Navy; Department of Health and Human Services funding began in 1990. The fiscal year 2002 HRSA appropriation for the Registry approximates $20 million. The Government contemplates awarding a cost-reimbursement contract with one base period and four one-year options.

Sources of further information include the Public Health Service Act and the web sites of: the current Registry contractor, the National Marrow Donor Program www.marrow.org, and the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry www.ibmtr.org. The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources. Send a pre-addressed envelope with your written request to the person above specified to obtain a paper copy of the request for proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) in Kampala, Uganda will issue a request for proposals (RFP) to implement aspects of Strategic Objective 7, Expanded Sustainable Economic Opportunities for Rural Sector Growth. This is one of three strategic objectives which compose the USAID/Uganda Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP) for the years 2002-2007. The ISP and annexes may be downloaded in three files from http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT976.pdf , http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT977.pdf , and http://ww.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT978.pdf . A thorough understanding of the USAID/Uganda ISP and the Government of Uganda Poverty Eradication Action Plan (http://www.finance.go.ug/documents.html) should prove very useful to offerors in preparing responsive proposals, once the RFP is issued. The solicitation will seek proposals to design and implement the Agricultural Productivity Enhancement Program (APEP) through a cost reimbursement contract for a period of five years, including the initial design phase. This activity will build on the successful approaches and results of current activities and those nearing completion, which were begun in the period prior to the new ISP. The primary objective of APEP will be to expand economic opportunities in the Ugandan agricultural sector by increasing agricultural productivity and marketing of key food and cash crop systems.  While building on past successes, the new program will place greater emphasis on creating economies of scale that will catalyze the transformation of Ugandan agriculture from low input/low output, subsistence farming to commercially competitive agriculture. The program will identify and address priority food and cash crop systems where productivity gains will lead to significant impacts on the economy and significant numbers of the rural population. APEP will address key constraints in the chain of production-to-market transactions, including input supply and distribution, applied research, technology applications, value-added processing, access to finance, producer organizations, and market development.  Emphasis also will be given to creating competitive agricultural and other off-farm rural enterprises as part of the transformation process. To request a copy of the solicitation that will be ready for distribution on or about May 15, 2002, please send an E-mail request to: rrutter@usaid.gov, or request a copy by mail by faxing your request to the Contracting Officer at 256 41 258981/233417. We also request that you include a current telephone number and/or a fax number or an e-mail address where you can be contacted. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet. (By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (Microsoft 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy). You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted below that, you have received the solicitation (when posted) through the Internet. As the recipient of the solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from INTERNET in its entirety. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you download the solicitation at FBO. Generally, the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt. However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet. You are therefore advised to regularly check the FBO Internet site for amendments. NAICS: 541611, Competition Level: Full and Open, Order of Magnitude (Threshold): Estimated $20 million.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) plans to award a sole source  contract to Lockheed Martin Management and Data Systems (LMM&DS), P.O. Box 8048, Philadelphia, PA 19101 for technical services to provide software enhancement activities for the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS). LMM&DS is the incumbent for engineering and development of the TTWCS.  This contract action will require the incumbent to work in close association with Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWC-DD) to support adaptive enhancements related to the continued evolution of TTWCS capabilities, perfective enhancements to improve software performance, suitability, reliability and maintainability, and corrective changes to fix defects.
      Initial TTWCS system level requirements included compliance with the Joint Technical Architecture, hardware-software independence, and for the TTWCS, to be expandable and extensible LMM&DS has independently developed core proprietary data that is necessary and essential for the enhancement activities of the TTWCS Operating Environment (OE).  The TTWCS Operating Environment supports intra software communications for Common Services and hardware diagnostics and by the use of Architecture Based Design (ABD) tools optimizes system design characteristics.  Detailed knowledge of ABD artifacts and design of the Operating Environment are therefore prerequisites to enable rapid response to correct emergent problems identified by the ships' forces and to support the addition of new system level requirements consistent with the evolutionary growth of software intensive weapon systems.  Additional requirements for this effort include certification within the past 24 months of a Level 3 or higher for software capability maturity using either the Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for software development, or the CMM Integrated for Systems Engineering and Software development.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the TTWCS, Lockheed Martin is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the TTWCS design and system architecture.   Therefore, award to any one other than the incumbent would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.
                The estimated period of performance for this prospective contractual action is 1 year, with 4 one-year options.  Note 22 applies.

<SUBJECT>D -- UXO Corrosion Integration-Work Plan Development, Sampling, Database and Model Development and Reporting
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-5TS5702C162
<RESPDATE>051302
<ARCHDATE>05282002
<CONTACT>Mara Shultz, Contracting Officer, Phone (618) 398-4929, Fax (618) 398-4931, Email mara.shultz@gsa.gov - Mara Shultz, Contracting Officer, Phone (618) 398-4929, Fax (618) 398-4931, Email mara.shultz@gsa.gov
<DESC>The GSA/FTS, Region 5 is announcing its intent to procure UXO Corrosion Integration services for sites outside of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP). Background of this project: The 1998 Defense Science Board report estimated that 1500 different sites, encompassing 15 million acres of land, contain Department of Defense (DoD) unexploded ordnance (UXO). Contained within the soil, these intact munitions corrode at vastly varying rates.  Depending on site-specific factors, the time to perforation or corrosion breakthrough can vary from 10 years to several thousand years. Understanding the relative rate of corrosion can greatly affect the determination of the risk posed by the exposure of the toxic energetic and constitute materials to the environment. The UXO are comprised of high explosives, the metallic container, and lesser quantities of fuse materials. While the metallic container, is not hazardous to human health, the fill components each have their own characteristic toxicity, temperature dependant solubility, and propensity for sorption; and thus, differing potentials to impact surface water and groundwater quality.  The elements described in this statement of work (SOW) will address the potential for energetic releases do to underground ordnance canister breach. We will sample UXO and adjacent soils under various environmental conditions to quantify the risk to the environment.  This work is an important element in evaluating UXO environmental risk at U.S. military installations. It is critical to DoD to understand the rate and mode of UXO corrosion as a basis for predicting when chemical constituents may be released from UXO. 
The efforts described in this statement of work are outside the scope of the ongoing UXO corrosion work funded by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP).  SERDP work focuses on UXO Corrosion on and in US DoD soils undergoing clearance by the Corp of Engineers. The efforts described here focus on UXO Corrosion on battlefields and US sites outside of the Huntsville Corp of Engineers clearance program.  This new effort is composed of the following elements: Work plan development  (Sampling Plan, QA/QC Plan, Health & Safety Plan);Field sampling at sites with ordnance of known age; Laboratory sampling and analysis, including biological; Database development; Model development (corrosion model analysis and update);Reporting. Testing to be conducted in this effort shall not include any UXO that is still explosively configured in any way, but shall include pieces of exploded munition bodies (range scrap) that represent the types of UXO that are found at individual military ranges.  The individual pieces of range scrap may have detectable quantities of explosives on their surfaces and must be handled accordingly.  Soils to be tested in this effort shall be collected from the same areas on the range as the range scrap and may contain explosives, as well, and must be handled accordingly.  The Government will provide the identification of each piece of range scrap provided to the contractor and will provide the specifications for the munitions body in the new, unused condition. Objectives: To accomplish UXO corrosion field sampling, UXO corrosion model development, UXO and soil analytical work, microbial corrosion assessment, and review ongoing work regarding the investigation of UXO Corrosion. 
Task Requirements:  The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, materials, and scientific and technical expertise to integrate, implement, and manage studies, modeling, sample and analysis dealing with potential UXO corrosion issues.   
The contractor shall write a work plan (health & safety, QA/QC, and Sampling Plan- to include a modeling test plan) and then teach the sampling plan protocol to field personnel at each UXO sampling site.  The contractor shall supply necessary sampling, field screening, and packaging for transport equipment to field personnel at each site. The contractor shall facilitate, coordinate, and provide resources to build a Microsoft Access database of UXO and soil parameters from the International and US sites (up to 6 sites will be chosen as part of the work plan development).   The Microsoft Access (version 2000) database must be compatible with Windows 2000 to facilitate its use by the DoD community. This database shall be compatible with no less than a Pentium 300 processor, 32 MB memory,1 GB hard disk,  24X CD ROM drive (minimum hardware requirement).  The database shall contain the following fields at a minimum: sample IDs, photographs, UXO (orientation, depths, disposal information, perforation positions and depth distribution), all laboratory data (soil type, soil size classes, moisture content, acidity, pH, resistivity, cation/anion concentrations, sulfate, sulfide, organic acids, organic content, porosity, permeability, metal x-ray diffraction, explosives concentrations, and biological (TBD).  The format and organization for this database shall be recommended by the contractor and accepted by the USAEC. The contractor shall execute and gather the data (analytical data) and perform data reduction, analyzing data associations and trends, to be included in a final report, on both the corrosion parameters (photographs, UXO position within soil column, pit depths and distribution, scale composition, possible galvanic or stress effects, metal microscopic analysis), biological (to be decided), and soil chemistry parameters: 
Ba, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na ? ICP, Alkalinity -EDTA Titration - SM 2320B 
Mercury Nitrate Titration (SM 2320 B),pH -meter -(ASTM D-1293),Total Acidity
Resistivity (initial) Instrumental ASTM D1125,
Resistivity (minimum) Instrumental ? ASTM D-1125,Sulfate- turbidimetric ? ASTM D-4130, Sulfide ?Sulfide Ion Detector Tubes ? API RP-13B-1, Organic Acids ? Back Titration Method ? SM 2320 B modified, Moisture content ? Oven Dry
Organic Content ? Muffle Furnace, Particle Size Distribution ? Sieve and Lazer methods, Soil Classification ? ASTM, Porosity ? by calculation or by measurement, Permeability ? by calculation or by measurement, 
Soil Energetic Concentrations according to draft EPA method 8095. A work plan (Sampling Plan, QA/QC, and Health & Safety Plan) shall be written and accepted by the Government prior to sampling and execution.  The contractor is not expected to physically sample the soil adjacent to the ordnance, but is expected to provide the instruction and guidance to those explosive ordnance specialists prior to and during sampling (where necessary).  There shall be approximately 100 soil samples, at least one per ordnance item, to characterize the general corrosivity of the soil.

<DESC>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for a team of Consultants to develop a conference program and prepare the briefing book for a Regional Waste-To-Energy/Renewable Energy Sources conference which shall take place in Prague, Czech Republic in October 2002.  The Consultant shall be selected with specific expertise in waste-to-energy technology and experience with the business side of the environmental sector.  The scope of this assignment shall include briefing book specific tasks and continuous dialogue with the TDA staff regarding the conference agenda and the attendee list.  The briefing book Consultant shall investigate and provide the contents for a project specific business book.  The Consultant shall also prepare the substance of the conference for TDA?s review and approval; recommend panel topics, identify potential speakers; provide detailed for opportunities in the region; identify approximately 40 European Delegates to attend the conference (as TDA?s guests); recommend approximately 300 targeted U.S. conference attendees; and develop a minimum of 5 Terms of Reference and Budgets for immediate TDA involvement.

The objective of this mission is to develop a briefing book and conference program that provides an interactive and creative forum for both European and American participants.  The Consultant shall be responsible for opportunity identification; country visits to identify delegates and export opportunities, communicate TDA capabilities to the European companies, develop the conference; and prepare a briefing book on CD ROM for the conference.

The Consultant shall research potential projects in Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia in order to prepare the briefing book.

Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, specialized training grants, business workshops, and various forms of technical assistance, we help U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure projects in emerging markets.  We assist in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors, which results in increased U.S. exports and jobs, and the completion of high quality successful project in host countries.

The Consultant must be in the position to present fair and unbiased information pursuant to the statement of work.

<DESC>Request for Proposals Notice for the Edward Zorinsky Federal Building Renovation, Omaha, Nebraska,  Job PCN: INE99004.  Request for Technical Proposals o/a 5-15-02. Request for Price Proposal o/a 8-30-02.  Estimated cost range:  $10,000,000 to $15,000,000.  Time for completion: 300 calendar days.  Summary of project:  The purpose of this source selection is to select a highly qualified construction contractor to provide renovation construction services on an existing Federal Office Building.  The existing Federal Office Building is a 415,000 gross square foot building located in Omaha, Nebraska and consists of nine (9) stories above grade, a basement, and partial sub-basement below grade plus a mechanical penthouse and small elevator penthouse at the top of the building.  This portion of the renovation will be a ?shell? construction contract which will include site/landscaping work, exterior demolition, exterior construction, some existing structural modifications plus interior layout and finish work.    This contract does not include the construction of  the MEP scope of work.   The successful contractor will be required to work with an MEP contractor (under a separate contract with GSA) and is required to provide overall scheduling and oversight responsibility for all shell contract work.  Tenant fit out work will be procured under separate contract by GSA.  In compliance with Executive Order 12770, the building is designed and will be constructed entirely with metric dimensions.  There may be minimal asbestos removal.  The bidder, or subcontractor used by the bidder, shall meet the competency qualification requirements for asbestos removal as specified in Section 00120 of the specification.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos removal shall satisfy special responsibility and shall provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with hazardous materials involved.  Proposals will include a base bid, and options.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Phase process. Phase I will be technical evaluations; Phase II will be for pricing. The Government intends to use the ?greatest value concept? in selecting the prime contractor.  The ?greatest value concept? is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors. The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  

Phase I, the Request for Technical Proposal (RFTP), contains a general scope of work, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  This RFTP will be issued on or about 5-15-02. All requests for the RFTP must be in writing.  Contact Joe York at 816-823-4915 or fax 816-926-3571.   There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on or about 5-30-02.  Proposals shall be received on or about 6-20-02 at the GSA, Office of Business & Support Services (6ADB), Federal Building, 1500 East Bannister Road, Room 1161, Kansas City, MO 64131-3088..  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFTP.  All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number on the face of the envelope for identification purposes.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52-215-1.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  There will be a short list of technically qualified contractors published in the FedBizOpps on or about 7-31-02.

Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance, are:  (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm (50%), (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel (35%), and (3) Management and Technical Approach (15%). The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factor.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price becomes more important. Joint venture arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependence of the members to provide a quality team.  The Government will evaluate Phase I submissions to establish those within a ?competitive range.? Only those firms within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to provide Phase II submissions, consisting of pricing and Subcontracting Plan and special competency requirements as specified in the specifications.

Phase II, Specifications (Bidding Documents) and drawings will be available for review at plan rooms at no cost.  The documents may be purchased by full size,  half size and CD (cost to be determined later)  Cost is non-refundable.  Bidders interested in obtaining the bidding documents will need to make financial arrangements directly with Lane Blueprinting, 1520 Main Street, Kansas City MO 64108, phone 816-221-2500.  The planholders list will be based on those requesting the documents. The bidding documents will be available on or about 8-30-02.   For further information contact Joe York at 816-823-4915 or fax 816-926-3571.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Glen Essink at 816-823-4904.

Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to negotiate a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.  In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the contractor will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Business concerns, Small Business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic limitative of the Federal Government, the GSA has established for fiscal year 2002 subcontracting goals of 40% for small business, 8% for small disadvantaged business, 5% for women-owned business, 2.5% for HUB Zone, and 5% for Veteran Owned (may include 3% Service Disabled Veteran Owned).    In support of the agency efforts, firms seeking consideration for this contract should provide maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities.  Offerors must also provide a brief written narrative of outreach efforts made to utilize these small businesses.   Phase Two offerors will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with their price proposals.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.

It is fully anticipated that the funding necessary for the optional work will be available early in the Government's fiscal year 2003 (beginning October 2002). After receipt of the Phase Two Technical and Price Proposals, an Evaluation Board will conduct a ?best value? analysis (see Subsection I.B.6 of the draft RFP), and submit their recommendations to the Selection Official for approval.  Award of one Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated approximately September, 2002, with Notice to Proceed issued approximately October, 2002. It is not the intent of EFLHD to receive project specific design or engineering recommendations as part of this Phase One selection process.  Offerors should limit their submittals to the information required by this Notice, and other information which may be relevant to the qualifications and experience of the Offeror.  No reimbursement will be made for any expenses associated with the preparation of Phase One submittals. Phase One Submittals:  Interested firms/teams may use Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, as the basis for their submittals.  SF 254 and 255 are available on the Government Printing Office?s website at: http://hydra.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_files.  Although SF 254 and 255 are formatted for Architect-Engineer and Related Services, the construction elements of the firms/team?s submittal may also be included on SF 254 and 255.  Alternate forms and formats may be submitted, provided that the applicable information from SF 254 and 255 is included.  The Phase One submittals shall be bound and tabbed with the major headings.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA Research and development in supply reduction of illicit drugs. The U.S. Army White Sands Missile Range, Electronic Proving Ground, Counterdrug Office, Fort Huachuca, AZ 85613-7110 in support of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Counterdru g Technology Assessment Center (CTAC), is soliciting white papers and proposals for innovative research and development projects to support the reduction of illicit contraband worldwide and to enhance the capabilities of Federal, State, and Local law enfor cement agencies conducting drug related investigations, sharing resources, and managing critical incidents.  Specifically, this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks applications and technologies that enhance our National capabilities to meet the strategic  Supply Reduction goals of ONDCP (see web site: www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov ). Areas of interest: This BAA focuses on science and technology-based initiatives that will contribute to the development and applications of technology to support: (1) Non-intru sive inspection - advanced concepts and approaches to interdict the flow of illicit drugs, currency and precursors from source countries, processing, in transit, across the borders, and to the final street consumer. These advancements include animal applic ations, radiographic, nuclear, electro-optical/hyper spectral, trace particle/vapor-based detection systems, and rapid processing, sorting, and screening methods. (2) Tactical Technologies - innovative devices, concepts, and systems for improving drug rela ted criminal investigations including the apprehension and successful prosecution of key criminals. These advancements include improvements to the law enforcement capabilities for surveillance, tracking, command and control, communications interoperability , communications intercept, and the management of information in support of investigations. Main areas of interest are: 1. Non-Intrusive Inspection:  Projects to be considered include advanced concepts and approaches for the interdiction of illicit drugs, currency and precursors from domestic and source countries, processing areas, in transit, across the borders (air, land, and sea), and to the final street consumer. These advancements include improvements to the processing, interpretation and analysis of d ata obtained from existing chemical, radiological and nuclear-based inspection systems as well as emerging interrogation systems offering improved detection and identification capability, to include improving the screening throughput and sorting of cargo a nd conveyances. These may include systems that utilize advances in chemical, radiological and nuclear-based detectors and detector arrays that improve resolution and the signal-to-noise; and advances in image and signal processing algorithms and intelligen t pre-screening techniques that aid operators in detecting and identifying illicit contraband. Hand-held devices that show evidence of ruggedized design and improved performance under field conditions. Other innovative approaches comprise employing diverse  data sets to link images obtained from prior inspections to spatial information of shipment containers and conveyances, historical trends derived from U.S. and foreign country law enforcement databases, and operator/driver information. These may include s ystems that utilize the latest advances in signal processing algorithms, nuclear, electro-optical/hyper spectral, particle/vapor collection and analysis approaches including animals. Proposed concepts and systems must include an approach for the test and v alidation of the system under operational field conditions. 2. Tactical Technologies: Projects to be considered include innovative devices, concepts and systems to enhance the capabilities of Federal, State, and Local law enforcement agencies conducting dr ug related criminal investigations, sharing resources and managing critical incidents. These advancements include improvements to the law enforcement capabiliti es for surveillance, tracking, command and control, communications interoperability, communications intercept, intelligence gathering and analysis, overall scene management, and the management of information in support of investigations. It is anticipated that that these devices and systems will apply the latest advances in digital video and audio signal processing, image reproduction and storage. Communications concepts include existing wireless data and voice networks and case management tools that make u se of open architecture and nonproprietary data storage schemes. Other interests include applications of systems and devices that allow the remote monitoring of cooperative and non-cooperative targets.  Concepts for case management may employ a central pro cessing architecture with separate modules that can be updated independently are of specific interest. These applications include planning tactical operations for the apprehension of criminals, as well as, applications for compiling and assembling related evidence in support of prosecutions. Proposed concepts and systems must include an approach for the test and validation of the system under operational field conditions. White papers and proposals: To save in preparation costs and resources offerors shall submit a white paper. The white paper shall not exceed 10 pages in length, including figures, charts, and tables. The 10 pages shall contain a technical description of the effort, identification of the risks, a schedule, and cost estimate.

<DESC>This acquisition is for a firm-fixed price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), environmental multiple award contract for sheep dip vat investigation and removal action at numerous sites on the Navaho Nation in Arizona and New Mexico. This procurement is 100% set-aside for competition between organizations owned or controlled by Native Americans under authority of the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47 (6-25-1910). The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) intends to award two or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts, however, the Government reserves the right to award only one contract as a result of this solicitation if at least two (2) qualifying quotations are not received. Awards will be made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 simplified acquisition procedures as amended through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-03. Contracts will be awarded to the responsible Native American organization(s) whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and offer the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods. The Government intends to award one contract on proposed task order 0001 identified in this solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s). The minimum guarantee is $5000 and applies to the five-year term of the contract(s). The aggregate value of task orders issued under the contract(s) will not exceed $2,500,000. The number and dollar value of task orders awarded under each contract will depend upon the results of the task order competition conducted among the firms that receive contract awards. Task orders will be competed on a firm fixed price basis among contract awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505(b). Typical work that may be performed under the resulting contract(s) includes: produce required CERCLA documentation or update existing documentation; prepare risk assessments to determine site risk to human health and the environment; plan and carry out removal actions at dip vat sites identified for remediation; and preparation of no further action and/or records of decision for any specified site included in the task order. Remediation actions shall include in-situ bioremediation, contaminated soil removal and transport to an approved disposal facility or other appropriate technology. The contaminants will include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under RCRA, CERCLA and the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA). The contaminants included are predominately toxaphene, lindane and Heptachlor. Contaminants may be present in soils, ground water and man-made structures. Contaminated sites were formerly used to dip sheep for purposes of insect control. Quotations will be evaluated on the following factors: 1) Ability to produce CERCLA documentation. 2) Ability to plan and carry out CERCLA investigations. 3) Ability to plan and carry out CERCLA removal actions. 4) Ability to assess site risk, particularly human health risk. 5) Past performance within the preceding three years. Factors 2 and 3 are equal to each other in importance and are twice as important as factors 1 and 4 which are also equal to each other. Factors 1, 2, 3 and 4 when taken together are 4 times the weight given to factor 5. Price will be considered when the quoters are judged as offering technically equivalent capabilities or if a price is so high as to diminish the value of an otherwise technically superior quotation. Quoters shall submit completed quotation packages in paper format. This may be done via fax, by mail, delivery service or via hand delivery to the contracting officer's attention at the address above. The Bureau does not have the ability to accept responses via electronic commerce or e-mail at the present time. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all quotations at any time prior to award; to award contract(s) to other than quoters submitting the lowest total prices(s) for task order 0001; to limit the number of quotations in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated quotations and to award to the quoter(s) submitting the quotation determined by the contracting officer to be most advantageous to the Government. Quoters are advised that an award may be made without discussions or any contact concerning quotations received. Therefore, quotations should be submitted that initially offer the most favorable terms. Quoters should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded the opportunity to qualify, discuss or revise their quotations. Costs associated with responding to the solicitation will not be compensated. The solicitation will be available in Microsoft Word 2000 for Windows file format recorded to a CD-ROM. Amendments will be shipped automatically to organizations requesting the solicitation. The solicitation is scheduled for release on or about May 9, 2002. Interested and qualified Native American organizations may request a copy of the synopsis on their letterhead addressed to the attention of the contracting officer. This request may be delivered by mail, delivery service, fax or by hand to the contracting office indicated above. The CD-ROM containing the solicitation will be shipped via FEDEX therefore you must indicate a physical delivery address not a post office box. Requests for additional information shall also be in written form to the attention of the contracting officer. Prospective contractors are advised that documents mailed via the U.S. Post Office to Government addresses are subject to delay due to irradiation requirements and it is therefore recommended that time-sensitive documents be sent by one of the other methods authorized. The BIA is not able to send or receive e-mail outside the Bureau at the present time.

<DESC>To apply for this financial assistance Program, applicants shall be state agencies on behalf of or in conjunction with industry or industry who have coordinated state agency endorsement on the State Endorsement Form, (form available in the solicitation).  Endorsement, here, refers to the act of a state(s) 1) recommending the proposed technology demonstration, 2) waiving its role as the primary applicant, and 3) assigning that role to industry via signature on the Form.  The State Endorsement Form must be reprinted on official state agency letterhead for signature by a state official, in cases where state agencies decline to be the primary applicant.  State agencies include state energy, state environmental, state business development, or any state agency as defined by 10 CFR 600.202.  In addition to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, and all federally-recognized Indian tribes are eligible as described in 10 CFR 600.202.  A list of participating state agencies can be found at www.oit.doe.gov/nice3. Applicants are not limited in the number of applications they can submit, provided that multiple applications are not submitted for the same project. Therefore, more than one application may be submitted by an applicant for different demonstrations.  However, funding will be limited to one award per demonstration.  Also more than one organization may be involved in an application, as long as the lead organization and lead financial assistance management responsibilities are defined.  Any sub-awards must be fully executed within 60 days or risk de-obligation of funds. Small businesses, according to the Small Business Administration definition, are especially encouraged to participate.  Applications submitted by the following will not be eligible for an award under this solicitation: (1) a federal agency; (2) a federally funded research and development center sponsored by a federal agency; or (3) DOE Management & Operating contractors. However, an application that includes performance of a portion of the work by the aforementioned will be evaluated and may be considered for award.  The portion of the project to be performed by the aforementioned must not be paid for by the funds from a potential award under this solicitation.  Also if another source of federal funds is used to pay for the portion of the proposed work, that other federal funding may not be counted as required cost share for the project. The Department of Energy's Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT) is funding a competitive grant program entitled the National Industrial Competitiveness Through Energy, Environment, and Economics (NICE3) Program.  The goal of the NICE3 Program is to advance U.S. competitiveness through commercial demonstration of energy efficient and clean production manufacturing and industrial technologies in industry.  This is accomplished by providing cost-shared, financial assistance to state and industry partnerships. Projects funded by NICE3 will achieve cleaner production in the U.S. manufacturing and industrial sectors through the adoption of energy efficient and cleaner production techniques.  Cleaner production refers to manufacturing and industrial processes that result in reduced energy use, waste, and emissions. These processes, when implemented in industry, improve U.S. industrial productivity and economic competitiveness.  It is expected that projects selected for one-time financial assistance awards will yield new processes and/or equipment that can significantly reduce use of energy and energy intensive feed-stocks and reduce generation of wastes in industry.  This goal is consistent with the mission of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which is to develop and promote the adoption of cost-effective renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies within the building, industrial, transportation, and power sectors for the benefit of economic competitiveness, energy security, and environmental quality of the nation. The following focus industries, which are the dominant energy users and waste generators in the U.S. manufacturing sector, are of particular interest to the DOE program: agriculture, aluminum, chemicals, forest products, glass, metal-casting, mining, petroleum, and steel. Interested parties should access the DOE Golden Field Office Home Page at http://www.golden.doe.gov/businessopportunities.html, click on Solicitations, and then access the solicitation number identified above.  The Golden Home Page will also provide instructions on registering and submitting applications in the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) web site.  The Solicitation can also be obtained directly through IIPS at http://e-center.doe.gov by browsing opportunities by Contracting Activity.  DOE will not issue paper copies of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) plans to award a sole source  contract to Lockheed Martin Management and Data Systems (LMM&DS), P.O. Box 8048, Philadelphia, PA 19101 for technical services to provide software enhancement activities for the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS). LMM&DS is the incumbent for engineering and development of the TTWCS.  This contract action will require the incumbent to work in close association with Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWC-DD) to support adaptive enhancements related to the continued evolution of TTWCS capabilities, perfective enhancements to improve software performance, suitability, reliability and maintainability, and corrective changes to fix defects.
      Initial TTWCS system level requirements included compliance with the Joint Technical Architecture, hardware-software independence, and for the TTWCS, to be expandable and extensible LMM&DS has independently developed core proprietary data that is necessary and essential for the enhancement activities of the TTWCS Operating Environment (OE).  The TTWCS Operating Environment supports intra software communications for Common Services and hardware diagnostics and by the use of Architecture Based Design (ABD) tools optimizes system design characteristics.  Detailed knowledge of ABD artifacts and design of the Operating Environment are therefore prerequisites to enable rapid response to correct emergent problems identified by the ships' forces and to support the addition of new system level requirements consistent with the evolutionary growth of software intensive weapon systems.  Additional requirements for this effort include certification within the past 24 months of a Level 3 or higher for software capability maturity using either the Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for software development, or the CMM Integrated for Systems Engineering and Software development.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the TTWCS, Lockheed Martin is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the TTWCS design and system architecture.   Therefore, award to any one other than the incumbent would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.
                The estimated period of performance for this prospective contractual action is 1 year, with 4 one-year options.  Note 22 applies.

The classification code for the instant notice should read "10 -Weapons" vice "S" as stated above.

Questions and Answers on RFP #N00421-02-R-3058

Q1.  Does the user wish to measure the ?thickness? of the coating or do they wish to measure the ?reflectivity? of the coating, but as a function of angle?  

A1.  We are not interested in measuring the thickness.  Reflectivity as a function of angle is of interest.

Q2.  If they do want a diffuse hemispherical reflectance (specular included/excluded) capabilities what does this mean?  There are many different accessories that could fit this application.  However, diffuse hemispherical reflectance accessories do not cover the desired full range, usually only to 20 microns (500cm-1)

A2.  Please quote on whatever diffuse hemispherical reflectance accessory you provide and specify the useful range.

Q3.  Do they want a service/maintenance contract for 3 years after the one-year warranty or 2 years after the one-year warranty?

A3.  Please quote 2 option years for 12 months each, as warranty starts from effective date of delivery.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a simulation feasibility study for the Toukimt and Meskala gas fields.

SERIOUS OFFERORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO VISIT ONAREP OFFICES (AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE) AND MEET WITH RELEVANT ONAREP STAFF BEFORE SUBMITTING A PROPOSAL.

The Office National de Recherches et d?Exploitations Petrolieres (ONAREP) is a public organization under the administrative supervision of Morocco?s Ministry of Energy and Mines, with a mandate of coordinating and managing all activities related to exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Morocco.  It explores for oil and natural gas in Morocco, and operates small onshore gas/condensate fields.  In addition, ONAREP is responsible for investment promotion in attracting foreign, including U.S. oil companies.  ONAREP negotiates the terms of reconnaissance (seismic) contracts and petroleum agreements, and applies jointly with its partners (foreign oil companies) for exploration and production licenses and permits.  It also maintains all available geophysical data and offers it to interested outside companies free of charge.

A simulation study for the Meskala and Toukimt gas fields is needed to minimize the excess water flow to the well bores, minimize the formation of condensate around the well bores, optimize production and recovery of gas condensate, and prepare a future development plan.  Based on performance data on the two fields, condensate had formed in the reservoir, reducing well production capacity.  One possible cause of the excessive water production experienced in some wells is water coning ? pulling a cone of water up into the well bottom by pressure difference between the water and the well bore.  

The objective of this study is to define a strategy to solve or mitigate the problems of production in the Toukimt and Meskala fields, and to adopt an optimal scenario of production, which will allow a precise evaluation of the final recovery of gas and condensate.  The study tasks are summarized as follows:  1) data gathering, review and analysis, 2) complete review of the existing production performance, 3) geophysical study, 4) geological model, characterization of the reservoirs, cartography, 5) analytical reservoir engineering, 6) numerical simulation of the reservoir, 7) preliminary environmental impact assessment, 8) production forecasts, 9) equipment, economic and financial evaluation, and 10) reports, presentations and deliverables.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $177,063 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).  The study has been estimated by TDA to cost US$354,126.  In addition to the TDA grant funding of US$177,063, the Grantee will cover the remaining costs required to complete the full terms of reference.
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background deskstudy report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and in French directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., Monday, May 6, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for the New US Land Port of Entry (Port) at Massena, NY, in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  GSA Northeast and Caribbean Region, Solicitation No. GS-02P-02-DTC-0020(N).  This project consists of the demolition and replacement of the existing US Border Station (Port) at Massena, NY with a new Port facility.  This project will have a principal emphasis on site development, new construction, and infrastructure improvements.  As a gateway to the United States, the Port must efficiently process traffic demands and operational requirements, while maintaining adequate safety for the staff and security of the border.  An appropriate Port design must holistically unify all program components into a distinguished and businesslike image reflecting the official status and serious law enforcement functions of the Port.  The new Port, over existing and newly acquired land, consists of the construction of new commercial vehicle queuing, parking, and inspection areas.  Additionally, the project includes, but is not limited to, the following: construction of a new secondary inspection warehouse and office buildings for commercial cargo; new export control building with inspection booths; infrastructure for private broker offices; new construction of the main administration building including offices above the primary passenger vehicle inspection booths; primary and secondary inspection plazas, and warehouse / garage facilities; demolition of existing structures and site features; temporary facilities to accommodate uninterrupted facility operations; extensive site work; and security enhancements.  The gross area of all existing buildings is approximately 1,402 m2.  The new expanded facility will contain a gross area of approximately 3,145 m2, and 80 outside parking spaces.  The estimated total cost of the expanded facility ranges between $13,000,000 and $14,500,000. The Design responsibilities will include, but are not limited to, program requirements, site development, transportation engineering, infrastructure improvements, demolition, civil, structural, interior construction, plumbing, HVAC, vertical transportation, fire protection, electrical system, lighting and power, sustainable features, and special systems (emergency generator, UPS, security, surveillance, communication and data system, energy management system).  The project is to include GSA design standards for secure facilities, as well as, specific tenant-agency security requirements. The existing facilities contain hazardous material requiring abatement.  The Scope of AE Services under this Firm Fixed Price Contract includes, but is not limited to: Predesign survey of existing conditions, operational analysis, programming studies; presentations to client; energy conservation analyses; development of housing plans, phasing and support for the relocation of the existing operations and occupants into temporary space, complete architectural and engineering design, preparation of specifications, CADD drawings, scheduling, value engineering, partnering, cost estimating, construction phasing and space planning, interior design, optional post construction contract services (PCCS), optional as-built drawings, optional construction phase A-E inspection services and other related services.  This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A-E Firms / Lead Designers interested in contracting of this work.  The A-E Firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have a contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the facilities' architecture.  The A-E Firm must address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction documents. In developing the project team required for Stage II, A-E Firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed within the State of New York, excluding specialty consultants.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expenses, or computer hookups for the prime firm or any consultants.  If the A-E Firm is comprised of a partnership, corporation or other legal entity permitted by law to practice architecture or engineering, a complete description of the proposed internal responsibilities of the components must be included in both the Stage I and Stage II submittals.  This entity must be in place at time of contract award.
The A-E selection will be completed in THREE stages as follows: In STAGE I, interested A-E Firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A-E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 1/2" x 11" format.  The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FBO announcement and briefly describing the A-E Firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; and Standard Form 254 (Architect Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project), which must be dated not more than twelve (12) months before the date of this synopsis.  Identification of major consultant firms is required at this stage.  An A-E Evaluation Panel will evaluate the submission based on the following criteria: (1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN [35%].  The A-E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan, building section, and site plan.  Each project shall demonstrate architectural design accomplishments with an emphasis on transportation engineering.  A minimum of two projects shall demonstrate civil engineering and/or multi-building design accomplishments.  The narrative shall also address how site constraints were satisfied by the design.  (2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT [25%].  In the Lead Designer's words (maximum of two typewritten pages), state overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply for this type of project.  (3) LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE [15%].  Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience and recognition for design efforts on similar projects.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. (4) LEAD DESIGNER PORTFOLIO [25%].  Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer's ability to provide design excellence.  Submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and typewritten description (maximum of two pages per project) of up to three new construction projects completed in the past ten years.  Narratives shall include a discussion of design challenges and resolutions. The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition etc. demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address her/his participation in the project.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private-sector peer, and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions. The Board will establish a short list of three to six A-E Firms.  For STAGE II, the short listed A-E Firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.  In this stage the entire project team, including the A-E Firms selected in the first stage, their designated lead designers and ALL the consultants who will work on the project, will be evaluated.  The A-E Firms will submit Standard Forms 254 and 255's which reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  A brief period, no longer than 14 calendar days, will be provided for the A-E firms to establish full project teams. The A-E Evaluation Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project, and project management.  The Stage II evaluations will culminate with an interview with the A-E Evaluation Board.  Stage II rankings will be used in conjunction with Stage I rankings to determine the A-E Firms that will be invited to participate in Stage III.  A minimum of three A-E Firms will be invited to participate in Stage III and will be further evaluated by an anonymous design competition, judged by a jury of independent design professionals.  The purpose of the design competition is to further evaluate the A-E's qualifications for this project by evaluating the design merits of each designer's "vision" for this specific project.  The design competition proposals will be used in conjunction with Stage II rankings in the final evaluation of the A-E Firms.  The designer's "vision" will weigh substantially in the final A-E Team selection by GSA.  The submitted design concepts become the property of the Government and may or may not be the basis, whole or in part, for the development of the final facility / building design.  This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52.219-19).  This procurement is open to small and large business concerns.  Before award of the contract, the A-E (if not a small business of $4,000,000.00 gross average sales receipts for the past three years), shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION: This is a Full and Open Sources Sought Synopsis and Market Survey to locate qualified companies, and to develop acquisition and technology planning strategies for the development of an operational space-based prototype hyperspectral imaging (HSI) sensor for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate's Hyperspectral Exploitation Program.

B. ACQUISITION AND TECHNOLOGY PLANNING:  AFRL is requesting information regarding advanced HSI technologies and concepts to meet broad-area search and target-characterization mission needs.  The information will be used to assist the Hyperspectral Exploitation Program in assessing the feasibility of and developing investment plans for a space-based demonstration system.  Information requested from industry (small and large businesses and academia) includes, but is not limited to, sensor system concepts, identification of enabling technologies, sensor manufacturing and risk reduction approaches, on-board processing strategies, assessments of the potential for commercial leveraging and cost estimates.  Of particular interest are innovative concepts and technologies that could lead to the development of a highly capable, cost-effective prototype.

C.  REQUIREMENTS: The prototype space-based hyperspectral imaging spectrometer system is expected to be capable of providing high-quality radiometric data over the 0.4 mm to 2.5 mm spectral regime with 5m x 5m spatial resolution pixels, co-registered with data from a 1m x 1m pixel broadband panchromatic sensor, to conduct the broad-area search mission with image cubes ranging from 20km x 20km to 20km x 100km. Specifically, AFRL is interested in technologies addressing mission needs as articulated by the following performance specifications:

Spectral Range: High performance is required throughout the reflective range from 0.4 mm to 2.5 mm for bathymetry, terrain classification, target material detection and identification, and other DoD applications.
Spectral Resolution: A nominal resolution of 10 nanometers is required for the identification of solids and liquids.
Spatial Resolution: A maximum GSD of five meters at nadir is considered consistent with the requirement to locate military vehicles, equipment and underwater obstacles.
Swath Width: A minimum swath width of 20 kilometers is desired to support the broad-area search mission requirement.
SNR: Consistently high SNR is required over the reflective range to provide a robust material identification capability.
Field of Regard: A nominal FOR of +/- 45 degrees from nadir with good imaging capability is desired to reduce revisit times. 
Imaging Direction: Imaging in any direction within the nominal FOR of +/- 45 degrees from nadir is required to search along coastlines or other lines of interest.
Onboard Product Generation: A capability is desired to generate products such as anomaly maps, terrain classification maps and target / material location information onboard the satellite for direct downlink to a tactical groundstation.
Collection Capacity: A capability to collect at least ten image cubes (20X20 kilometers) per orbit is required to cover multiple areas of interest.
Communication: A "store and dump" system is anticipated, with the additional desired capability to receive tasking from, and to downlink imagery or products to, compatible tactical ground sites.
Geolocation Accuracy: A capability to geolocate pixels with an accuracy of 25 meters (3 sigma) would enhance cueing for auxiliary sensors, as well as enhance fusion with other information sources.
Optical Distortion: Smile and keystone effects should be minimized to support automated product generation.
Calibration Accuracy: An automated capability to generate radiance data in near real time with an absolute calibration accuracy of better than two percent is desired.

These performance parameters should be considered as goals, with the GSD and swath parameters as firm system requirements.  Information concerning the technologies available to achieve the suggested performance is desired.  Please identify those parameters that have substantial cost impacts.

AFRL would like to entertain the incorporation of additional capabilities that would enhance the utility of the prototype.  A one-meter GSD panchromatic sensor capable of coincident imaging is a primary consideration.  Polarimetry, emissive MSI (temperature mapping), a reconfigurable sensor design capable of selectable focal lengths, yielding both five and one- to five-meter GSDs, and other potential utility enhancements are of interest to AFRL.

This solicited information is intended to give the Air Force an understanding of the range of possible solutions.  Please include answers to the following questions in your response:

	What is the maturity (NASA Technology Readiness Level ('TRL') of the technologies required to achieve the suggested performance (concept through current-off-the-shelf (COTS) elements)?
	What performance parameters are major cost drivers?
	How should the system concept outlined above be modified to ensure that the low cost and high performance goals are met?
	What is the earliest possible launch date for deployment of a well-characterized, space-based, operational HSI prototype?
	What is the ROM cost estimate for deployment of such a prototype, including the cost of the sensor, sensor characterization, bus, data capture and communications, and launch?
	What are the cost and schedule impacts of including each of the enhancement options?

There is no page limitation or evaluation criteria applicable to the above requested information.  Submit an original and three copies to the contracting office below within 30 days of publication of this announcement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Notice is No. AB1330-02-RP-00072.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25.  NOAA proposes to negotiate a sole-source fixed-price contract with Geoprobe Systems for Supplies and service.  The NOAA Ocean Service Office of Response and Restoration's Pribilof Islands Restoration project requires the following equipment to pursue ongoing site investigations and groundwater contaminations on St. Paul Island, AK: PM54DT Geoprobe Model 54DT Soil Probe - one (1) each; GH41 Hammer - one (1) each; (15778) Enclosed Transport Trailer - one (1) each; (AT1000) Portable Vacuum/Volume System - one (1) each; (513) 1.25" Accessory Tool System - one (1) each; LB Discrete Soil Sampling System - one (1) each; (516) Screen Point 15 Groundwater Sampling System - one (1); (518) Marco-Core Continuous Soil Sampling System - one (1); Post Run Tubing System - one (1); (DT1000) Unit Delivery and System Training - one (1); Direct Image Membrane Interface Probe System (FC4000) Field Instrument - one (1); MP3500 MIP Controller (used with FC4000) - one (1); Basic Component Package - one (1); Model 54DT - one (1); System Training at Geoprobe Systems, Salinas, KS - one (1); Optional Accessories - one (1). The Geoprobe 54DT is only system we are aware that will allow workers to quickly acquire undisturbed soils samples down to 200 feet. Manual insertion of a collection rod is greatly limited by the strength of the individual hammering down the rod string.  Furthermore, the manual method requires much more individual strength and given the harsh weather conditions on the island makes the collection inefficient.  Many of the sites on the Pribilofs transgress across sloped terrain. The 54DT is able to sample these hilly environments, where truck mounted system would not be able to access either, because of stability or because the truck would become stuck in the soft overburden.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to award this contract to Geoprobe Systems on a sole source basis, because of their extensive experience in manufacturing this type of equipment.  The proposal shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers - Commercial Items, and the offer shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.  FAR clause 52.212.4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition and there are no addenda to this provision.  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order - Commercial Items is applicable.  Include the additional clauses 52.219-3; 52.219-4; 
52.219-5; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-35; 52.222-36; 52.222-37; 52.223-9 (Alt. 1); 52.225-13; 52.232.34; 52.232-35; CAR 1352.201-70.  This is a firm fixed price contract.  The proposal from Geoprobe Systems must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., Pacific Time, May 14, 2002.  Full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) can be accessed on the Internet at www.arnet.gov/far.  For further information, please contact Carla Echols (206) 526-6370.  See Note #1 NAICS Code is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  Requests are due no later than 2:00 p.m., May 14, 2002.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) intends to negotiate with BAE Systems Aerospace, Inc., CNI Division, located at 164 Totowa Road, Wayne, NJ 07474-0975 on a sole source basis (Numbered Note 22) to provide support to the Joint Task Force (JTF) Wide-Area Relay Network (WARNET) Program. This transition and transformation process stems from the Office of Naval Research ELB ACTD which now will insert interim\placeholder wireless communication technologies, as found in the AN/VRC-99A(C) radio, into wireless communications architectures planned by transition partner organizations. The capabilities of the AN/VRC-99A(C) radio were developed, integrated, field-tested, and enhanced as part of the test and evaluation process of the ELB ACTD program.  BAE Systems provided follow-on enhancements to the AN/VRC-99A(C) radios that were demonstrated in MSD I to support the final systems design of the ELB ACTD WARNET and fabricate additional AN/VRC-99A(C) radios to support interim testing with operational forces.  BAE Systems also made specific enhancements that allowed more dynamic networking capability of the AN/VRC-99A(C) radios to support the final ELB ACTDD C4ISR communications architecture, now incorporated into the JTF WARNET architecture. The design and drawings of the AN/VRC-99A(C) radio are proprietary to BAE Systems. The JTF WARNET transition process will provide further opportunities to enhance, test, and improve this technology as it is incorporated into other programs.  The required start date for this effort is 01 July 2002.  Responses to this notice must be received within 45 days of publication of this notice.

<OFFADD>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Wright Research Site, Det 1 AFRL/PK Bldg 167, Area B, 2310 8th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433-7801
<SUBJECT>A -- Pointer/Tracker State-of-the-Art and Affordability Analysis
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Sensors Directorate is seeking information about Near Term (1 to 1-1/2 year) and Mid Term (3 to 5 year) projected availability, performance characteristics, and affordability data for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), non-developmental-item (NDI) and/or advanced developmental Pointer/Tracker (P/T) technologies, systems, and/or components. Advanced P/T technologies are enablers for a variety of potential military applications, including aircraft self-protection and airborne countermeasures. A supplemental package has been developed to provide technical performance attributes for the technology of interest. The supplemental package includes two questionnaires, explanatory material, and background information to support this P/T technology assessment. Interested contractors may obtain this supplemental information package from the AFRL POC at a Technical Interchange Meeting/Industry Day to be held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH, Area B, Building 620, northwest corner, Eagle Conference Room at 1:00PM EDT, 30 May 2002. Gathered information will be used to expand the Air Force database of available P/T components, and systems suitable for use in airborne IRCM systems. The information will be used to develop an acquisition strategy for a SDD program leading to production. AFRL partnered with LAIRCM System Program Office (SPO) will also use the information to build a potential offerors list for possible future procurement of hardware and/or research and development effort in advancing the state of the art in P/T technology. It is the desire of the AFRL to consider technologies that offer required capabilities with minimal impact to the integration and installation of the equipment in large aircraft. Successful P/T Technologies will be assessed against the following categories of attributes:  Aircraft Interface/Integration, System Performance, Life Cycle Cost, Maturity, and Logistics issues. Interest in an advantageous product will be followed by subsequent inquiries to the contributor. Even though this request is aimed toward Air Force-specific needs, organizations that have contributed to similar solicitations by other DOD branches or Government agencies should respond here as well to assure exposure of their technology to the Air Force. This announcement is a request for information and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued. However, AFRL and the Air Force will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning, especially near-to-mid term laboratory investment planning. It is recognized that any cost information provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates. Subsequent acquisitions may follow in the ways that best meet Air Force needs. The government invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies. If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the technology being proposed, please include this information in the response. P/T contractors who take part in the 30 May 2002 Industry Day may also be invited to participate in potential follow-on activities sponsored by the LAIRCM SPO or AFRL Sensors Directorate. AFRL may sponsor contractors as appropriate in upcoming activities.  However, contractors will participate at their own expense. Contractors providing P/T hardware and instrumentation in any potential future activity do so at their risk. The government will not be liable for damage caused by test operations or environmental factors. SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: This announcement and the AFRL supplemental data packages are UNCLASSIFIED. AFRL anticipates that information received in response to this RFI may be CLASSIFIED up to the SECRET level, especially if it discloses current or projected capabilities and limitations of P/T systems as installed on USAF aircraft. Consult the current classification guide for your technology for details. Contractor personnel who will travel to and work on any future activities must have a SECRET clearance. Attendance at the Technical Interchange Meeting/Industry Day will also require a SECRET clearance and a visit request submitted NLT 20 May 02, to the security POC below. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government. The Air Force will not reimburse providers for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI.
