<DESC>NA Estimated draft solicitation issue date is August 5, 2002.  Estimated closing date of draft solicitation is August 20, 2002.  Estimated final solicitation issue date is September 10, 2002. Estimated final solicitation closing date is October 10, 2002.  The  U.S. Army is in the process of modernizing all Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs).  Each SKO consists of a wide variety of tools and equipment essential to providing support to the Army’s inventory of technologically advanced tactical and combat support weapon  systems to meet the Army’s Ordnance and Combat missions.  This process is incremental.  With the completion of each redesign, each SKO will be procured and fielded. The Army is soliciting proposals from large and small businesses to establish long-term Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contracts for various tool sets, kits and outfits (SK0s).  It is the Army’s intent to make multiple awards under this solic itation to both large and small businesses.  Individual delivery orders will be competed among all awardees unless it is determined that a specific delivery order should be competed exclusively among small business awardees.  The Army will follow the Feder al Acquisition Regulation's  “rule of two” in determining whether a specific delivery order is to be competed among small business awardees (See FAR 19.502(b)). SKO's are defined as:   	Sets:  a collection of tools/components used by a group, section, squad, platoon or unit usually supplemented by tool kits to perform an organizational mission. Unit of issue of Set (SE) 	Kits:  An assembly of tools/components in a small pouch or box designed for use and carried by an individual or crew. Unit of issue of Kit (KT) 	Outfits: An assemblage of tools or equipment.  May include separately type-classified items as a component such as: Pneumatic Tool and Compressor Outfit, Water Purification Outfit, Tool Outfit Hydraulic Systems Repair and Tool Outfit Pioneer Portable Elec tric Tools. Unit of issue of Outfit (OT). For your information, Army Tools are defined as an instrument, implement, utensil, device or machine, powered or hand operated, used in diagnosis, making operating adjustments, performing damage or fault repair and preventive maintenance of Army material. In order to promote competition this requirement has been divided into the following segments: 1. Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 2. Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a  single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 3. Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be housed  in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 4. Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit i n a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components o f a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 5. Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its “carrier” by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Each segment will be individually competed and awarded.  The Army intends to establish two award pools for each segment: one will be created under full and open competition and the other will be for small business concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments.  Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical, performance risk and price proposal based on a sample SKO requirement.  The Army reserves the right to issue a delivery order on the sample SKO proposals.  The Army further reserves the right to issue an order under the award pool established under full and open competition or the award pool of small business concerns, depending upon proposals received. Small business concerns may compete for the award pool to be established under full and open competition and the pool to be established exclusively for small business concerns.  Small business concerns may submit alternative proposals based on meeting or n ot meeting the non-manufacturers rule (see 13 CFR 121.406).  Proposals based on meeting the non-manufacturers rule must be supported by adequate documentation. Offerors not receiving an award to be included in a pool of awardees will be debriefed and will have an opportunity to file a protest.   In the event that a requirement for a delivery order is competed exclusively among small businesses and only one offeror meets the nonmanufacturing rule, the contracting officer will issue the order to that offeror provided the price is fair and reasonable  and all other technical and past performance considerations are met.  The contracting officer will substantiate any determination regarding whether a price is fair and reasonable and will not consider a courtesy offer from a large business unless the cont racting officer determines that the small business offer is unreasonable.  In the event that the small business offer is unreasonable, the contracting officer may cancel the competition and compete the requirement among the full and open pool of awardees.  Finally, a small business who is otherwise eligible for award may apply for a COC if the contracting officer determines that the small business is unable to meet the nonmanufacturers rule. Interested potential offerors are invited to attend a pre-proposal conference to discuss the solicitation.  The Pre-Proposal conference will take place at The Lodge (formerly Jumers), Bettendorf, IA from 8:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 20, 2002.  This conference is open to all contractors.  The Pre-Proposal Conference will be a working luncheon.  The cost of the luncheon is $10.00 due by August 15th, 2002.  Checks will be made out to TACOM-RI Protocol and mailed to AMSTA-LC (Protocol/Laura Batchel or), TACOM-RI, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 61299-7630.  Sorry no credit card transactions.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
Project Title:  2nd Floor Courtroom Renovation
Location:  Sidney L. Christie Federal Building, 845 Fifth Avenue, Huntington, WV 25701
Solicitation Number:  GS-03P-07-CD-C-0062

Provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for renovation of existing 2nd floor courtroom.  The construction firm will be required to include existing finishes which are painted plaster walls, gypsum wall board ceiling, and carpet floors over original cork flooring on poured in place concrete.  The courtroom has significant standing and running stained ornamental trim, fixed bench seating, and guard rail.  The ceiling has ornamental dentil plaster molding and trim throughout.  Further work includes modification to juror box and associated window treatments, HVAC, and lighting.  Lastly, the work also includes providing an empty conduit system for audio and video systems.

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.   Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, management and key personnel qualifications, technical and organizational approach, and on their price proposals.

The acquisition shall consist of four (4) phases:  Phase 1 ? Receipt and evaluation of technical offers and of initial price proposals.  Phase 2 ? Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors on the basis of GSA's opinion.  GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 ? A determination of the competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 ? Completion of negotiations with firms in the competitive range, if necessary.  Receipt and evaluation of final proposal revisions.  

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 3, without negotiations.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications, and 3. Technical and Organizational Approach.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220.  This unrestricted procurement is being conducted under full and open competitive provisions in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The purpose of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program is to assess the ability of small businesses to compete successfully in certain industry categories without competition being restricted by the use of small business set-asides.  This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.

Description

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.

The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit proposals for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Chemical and Biological Technologies Medical Science and Technology (S&T) Division, which includes both the Core and Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI) programs, research and development program requirements. 

Scope:

The Chemical and Biological Technologies Directorate of DTRA includes the Medical S&T Division which is charged with meeting the science and technology requirements for medical countermeasures to chemical, biological and radiological threat agents.  The Medical S&T program may be generally characterized as composed of diagnostic, pretreatment and therapeutic development emphases.  Included in the Medical S&T program is the TMTI, which is specifically focused on innovative technology and processes to address emerging pathogens, as well as the potential threat of genetically modified agents, through the development of genetic sequence libraries, platform technologies and broad-spectrum therapeutics.

Purpose:
The DoD implements a vigorous medical research and development program in chemical and biological defense with the goal of protecting the warfighter from the ramifications of biological and chemical warfare agents.  This BAA is focused on developing tools and countermeasures that can be brought into acquisition and fielded worldwide.  These products must demonstrate regulatory compliance, general robustness, and be highly effective at a reasonable cost.  Successful candidates must demonstrate a clear path to regulatory approval, production, and end user utility.  They must all be amenable to use in a military environment.
Solicitation Approach and Overview:

This BAA seeks optimum approaches to meet technology objectives within the CB Medical S&T Division?s Core and TMTI programs as outlined in the BAA.  The Government encourages proposals that span a wide spectrum of possible technical and business solutions in response to technology topics.  

This BAA will be a multi-year BAA, remaining effective for three years from the initial date of issuance, unless amended otherwise.  The topics and timelines published in the initial issuance are firm.  In the future, ongoing, new or emerging requirements may necessitate amendment of the BAA to include new or different topics.  At any time that the topics are amended, a new proposal submission timeline will also be specified.  These amendments are expected, generally, to occur on an as-needed basis, and may occur more often than annually, resulting in multiple calls for proposals from this BAA.  This BAA, in addition to any amendments issued in conjunction with this BAA, will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and for informational purposes on the DTRA website.  It is the responsibility of the offerors and interested parties to stay abreast of BAA amendments by regularly checking the FedBizOpps website.

Acquisition and assistance instruments that will be considered for use for award include FAR-based Contracts and Other Transaction Agreements, with a preference for FAR-based Contracts.  The government does not intend to award grants under this solicitation.  All other pertinent information can be found in the BAA solicitation document.

All questions (administrative or technical) related to this BAA must be e-mailed to CBMedicalBAA@dtra.mil.

<DESC>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the relocation of the operating and living facilities for Kabul International Airport.

NAMSA is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. Division of the project in different contracts/lots is not foreseen.

The rough cost estimate for this project is between Euro 35 and 45 million (between $50 million and $64 million). The reference for the Invitation for Bid (IFB) is IFB-ISAF-ENG-068-002. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

The provision of classified information with the tender is not foreseen.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The requirements of NAMSA in execution of this project to be built on ground leveled by others include the following facilities:

- Passenger Reception Center (PRC)
- HQ Main Building (HQMB)
- Provide APOD Operations Center (AOC)
- Force Protection Building
- Cargo Air Terminal Office (CATO)
- Minor Buildings
- Relocation of existing hangar (rotary wing)
- Relocation of existing cargo tents
- Medical Facility Role 1
- Emergency Water Supply

All other buildings are designed with a conventional concrete load-bearing and anti-seismic structure, with a combination of concrete columns, concrete masonry units (blocks) and/or concrete walls as called for in each type of building, or with the use of existing deployable units, such as accommodation containers, hangars and large tents, all to be refurbished upon relocation. Additionally, other buildings have been designed as pre-engineered structures with steel frame and thermally insulated sandwich panel cladding. All other features of the buildings have been generally designed to minimum military requirement standards, with internal partitions in gypsum board, linoleum floors (ceramic tiles for floors and walls of wet areas), and sound-absorbing ceilings only in offices. Plumbing, electrical, and CIS distribution is to be run in exposed piping, ducting, and cable trays throughout, to limit cost and ensure ease of maintenance.

Safety of personnel in each type of building has been ensured by the provision of an adequate number and size of means of egress (exit doors, fire escape stairs) in case of fire, all provided with emergency lights, exit signs, etc., all in accordance with current European Norm (EN) standards, plus the installation of a centralized smoke alarm system with smoke detectors in each room, all connected to one central alarm panel per building that is connected to a 120dB siren and a pair of roof-mounted flashing lights, enabling the fire fighting unit of the base to detect immediately the building originating the alarm. Fire fighting provisions include the installation of one or two fire hydrant cabinets with rolled hoses in each floor of each type of building. Main electrical panels of each building will be controlled by a fireman switch. Roadside fire hydrants will be installed along all main circulation roads. All other buildings will be provided with an ample number of fire extinguishers of a type suitable for fires Class B and C. All buildings will be quipped with roof-mounted lightning rods in accordance with the applicable EN standards.

Utilities shall include the following:

Electrical generation and distribution: based on the provision of new power generators the power of which will be transformed from Low Voltage (400 V, 50 Hz) to Medium Voltage (6.000 V) and distributed through the camp by means of directly buried MT cables. A suitable number of MV/LV dry transformers located in each area will convert power to LV feeding the distribution panels of each facility. Power generators and main switchboards shall be housed in hardened buildings.

Water supply and distribution: Water shall be drawn from three well-spaced well points drilled to a depth of approx. 100m to ensure a constant supply of water of the better quality available. Piping from the well pumps will lead water to a central, blast-proof water reservoir holding three days of consumption at maximum usage rate (300 lt. man/day) or one week at rationed water consumption (130 lt. man/day) where the water will be treated to eliminate turbidity and disinfected before being stored in the reservoir. From the same facility, water pumps will feed the water supply network of the camp at a pressure of 8 bars. Pressure reduction valves lowering the pressure to 3 bars will be installed at the base of piping raisers supplying domestic usage points, while it will be maintained at 8 bars for connection to the fire hydrants and indoor fire hoses. Piping network has been dimensioned on the basis of maximum simultaneous consumption, i.e. two fire hydrants being used simultaneously at the rate of 80 cubic m/hour. To limit water consumption, all taps in ablutions shall be fitted with flow limitation appliances, with showers fitted with thermostatic temperature controls as well.

Sewage: Raw sewage will be collected from all discharge points and run to a number of lifting stations equipped with crushers/shredders of foreign objects, from which the sewage will be pressurized at 3 bars and run to a biological sewage treatment plant built in concrete and prefabricated modules. Treated effluent will have a quality allowing for its discharge in the drainage ditch surrounding the camp. A bypass valve will allow the storage of part of the treated effluent in storage reservoirs, from which a separate piping system will take the water to be used as irrigation water for the grassed areas during the summer months.

Solid waste: To reduce as much as possible the number of trucks leaving and entering the camp to dispose of solid waste, presenting a considerable risk for security, the project includes a garbage compactor capable of compacting the average daily production of solid waste into the volume of a single container that can be better inspected on returning to the camp after its discharge than the several trucks currently used for the same purpose.

CIS Connectivity: The project includes a network of PVC ducts linking the two SATCOM stations and Line-of-Sight communication towers to be built at the western and eastern sides of the camp (latticed towers 30.00m high included in the project) among themselves, and to each facility requiring connectivity. Consistent with previous authorizations, the project includes also penetrations and shafts for CIS inside facilities, but does not include ducting, cabling, wiring and dedicated CIS equipment (to be installed by others).

Paved areas: include the necessary asphalted roads, all designed to MLC 60, in widths of 3.00m (one way), 5.00m (two-lanes, low traffic) and 7.00m (two lanes, main roads), plus asphalt and concrete hardstands designed to accommodate cargo handling and storage facilities, a helicopter hangar, power generators, a sewage treatment plant and other lesser facilities. All roads running through densely populated areas will be completed with 1.00m-wide asphalted sidewalks. Other roads will instead be bordered by drainage ditches collecting the runoff of surface waters.

Design Standards: all structural, mechanical, electrical, and safety characteristics of the buildings to be built under the project will be calculated and designed in accordance with the applicable EN standards and having in mind the widest possible use of locally produced materials, subject to their compliance with the EN. In performance of the project, the contractor may refer to other standards (national or international) provided that their requirements are equal to or better than their equivalent EN Standards.

The following EN standards are of particular relevance for the design and construction of this project: 

EN 1990 Basis of Design
EN 1991 Actions on Structures
EN 1992 Design of Concrete Structures
EN 1993 Design of Steel Structures
EN 1994 Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Structures
EN 1995 Design of Timber Structures
EN 1996 Design of Masonry Structures
EN 1997 Geotechnical Design
EN 1998 Design Provisions for Earthquake Resistance of Structures
EN 1999 Design of Aluminum Structures

<CONTACT>Annette de Sercey 850-235-5483 , or Contracting Officer Wanda Cutchin at 850-636-6140.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) ,intends to issue a five-year follow-on Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to EADS Defence & Security Networks (formerly Cogent), Meadows Road, Newport, Gwent, NP19 4SS, Great Britain, for the design and fabrication of magnetic minesweeping cables to support Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM) operations.  Follow-on minesweeping cable fabrication and delivery shall consist of the fabrication and testing fully operational tow cables to be used to deploy (stream), tow, and recover a functional tow body  (sonar system or mine neutralization system) from an  MH-60S helicopter or other platform, in military applications.  The tow cable shall contain optical fibers, electrical power conductors, hard fairings, ribbon fairings, tow staff (wet end mechanical termination), wet end and dry end electro-optical connectors, and load carrying armor.  Optical fibers are used fo!  r data transmission, and electrical conductors are used to supply power to the towed body from the helicopter.  Engineering services are also being acquired to advance the state-of-the-art in design and production of OAMCM tow cables and to ensure the timely application of expert engineering services that contribute to the system performance of OAMCM towed systems.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Given the complexity of the MH-60S tow cable and the level of system knowledge required to manufacture and meet all interface and towing requirements of the very complex OAMCM equipment and systems, EADS is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking.  Furthermore, this is a follow-on to contract N61331-02-D-0036 for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system !  or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, w ithin the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  An extensive knowledge base was developed by performance of efforts under competitively awarded contracts N61331-95-C-0050, N61331-95-C-0051, N61331-95-C-0052, Delivery Orders 0034 and 0093 under contract N61331-97-D-0031, N61331-99-D-0035, and N61331-02-D-0036.   Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   In summary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.     Note 22 applies.

<DESC>NASA/JSC proposes to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Pacific Scientific, Energetic Materials, Co. (PSEMC) for the acquisition of J2-X Gas Generator solid propellant igniters for use in the RS-18 testing at White Sands Test Facility (WSTF). The contractor shall provide 20 units of J2-X Gas Generator Solid Propellant Igniters, weekly status reports of development and production starting at contract award and ending at hardware delivery, and engineering support of one engineer for test readiness review and acceptance test support. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Pacific Scientific, Energetic Materials, Co. (PSEMC).  PSEMC is the sole supplier of the J2-X gas generator solid propellant igniter.  The J2-X gas generator igniters were designed by PSEMC through Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) for Marshall Spaceflight Center (MSFC) for the J2-X program, a human-rated NASA spaceflight program.  J2-X design has been overseen by MSFC and PWR through Preliminary Design Review (PDR) stage, with performance, safety, manufacturing, and testing data provided to NASA MSFC and PWR. Because the RS-18 LOX/LCH4 test campaign includes NASA MSFC and PWR personnel, technical information exchange and personnel support is available to NASA JSC and WSTF personnel for use of the J2-X solid propellant igniters.  The estimated delivery date for the supplies is 14 weeks after receipt of award (early delivery is acceptable).  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Interested parties may submit their proposals to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on November 14, 2007.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, Office of Administration and Resources Management (OARM), Facilities Management Division (FMD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with DCT, Inc. under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 for a one-month extension period, plus a one-month option period, under Contract 68-C-03-017 for on-site operations and maintenance services pending award of a follow-on contract.  The current contract is scheduled to expire on 11/30/07.  It is expected that a follow-on contract will be awarded by January, 2008 as a result of Solicitation No. PR-CI-07-10484.

During this period, the contractor shall provide services in support of the operations and maintenance of the EPA-Cincinnati Facilities.  This includes routine maintenance of all building and laboratory systems, work orders, service calls, and emergency repairs.   Specifically, the contractor shall provide facility support services that include, but are not limited to: the operation and maintenance of buildings and equipment; alterations and repairs to the buildings; computer- assisted drafting (CAD) services; and engineering documentation.  Secondary functions include but are not limited to: fire alarm maintenance, snow removal, window washing, pest control, waste removal, and engraving services.  

DCT, Inc. is uniquely qualified to meet EPA's requirement during the extension period based on its operational expertise, knowledge of the facility and equipment, familiarity with the on-going projects, and its capability to meet any potential critical deadlines resulting from service calls and/or need of emergency repairs.  DCT is already on-site.  A competitive procurement for the proposed extension would entail substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Award to DCT, Inc. will ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of service.

This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   This action is being processed under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The applicable  NAICS code is 561210.  The anticipated award date is mid Nov, 2007.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Steven Perry, 3097821088
<DESC>Estimated issue date of Amendment 022 is February 24, 2006. Estimated closing date is April 10, 2006. The purpose of this amendment is to reopen the solicitation to augment the award pools established for full & open competition and small business concerns in Segments 1-3 to promote additional competition and production capacity.  The solicitation, origina lly issued on September 13, 2002, is for the procurement of various Sets, Kits and Outfits and may be referred to as the SKO solicitation. The term sets, kits, and outfits collectively refers to a wide variety of tools and equipment used to support the Arm y's tactical and combat support weapon systems and its Ordnance and Combat missions.  This amendment will likely result in the award of multiple contracts to expire concurrently with the existing award pool contracts.  A contract under a particular segment will give the awardee the opportunity to compete for future requirements in that Segm ent.  This amendment will not result in the award of a delivery order for any of the sample requirements.   We are soliciting proposals from both large and small businesses.  Delivery Orders will be competed in accordance with the fair opportunity to compete provisions set forth in the original solicitation.  The award of a contract is not a guarantee that an or   der will be placed against that contract.  The award only signifies that the awardee is eligible to compete for delivery orders pursuant to the fair opportunity to compete provisions.  We will use the contracts, consistent with the fair opportunity to co mpete provisions, to fulfill its SKO requirements unless otherwise exempted by law or regulation. In order to promote competition this requirement was divided into the following segments in the original solicitation: Segment 1 Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final use in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 2 Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 3 Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be   housed in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 4 Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a   unit in a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components of a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are go-to-war  items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 5 Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop se t a re permanently mounted to its carrier by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Segments 1-3 will be individually competed and awarded under this amendment.  Segments 4 and 5 may be augmented at a later date.  The Army intends to augment, or add to, the  award pools already established for each segment:  one under full and open compet ition and the other for small business concerns.  As stated in the original solicitation, the Government reserves the right to augment the award pools from time to time to promote additional competition or to secure production capacity concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more of Segments 1-3 in accordance with the Section L Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors in this amendment. Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical and past performance proposal base d on the sample  requirement that was used to create the award pools under the original solicitation.  The sample for each of the segments are as follows:   	Segment 1:  Small Arms Repairman Tool Kit  Segment 2: Engineer ConstructionCarpenterTool Kit; 	Segment 3:  Explosive Ordnance Disposal Tool Kit;  These DFPs are located on our open solicitation page as Attachments 001, 003, and 005. Offers will be evaluated in accordance with the Section entitled Evaluation Factors for Award included in this amendment. Contract clauses that will be applicable to resulting award pool contracts will e included in this amendment. If interested contact perrys2@ria.army.mil or lisa.devlin@us.army.mil.

<DESC>This modification supersedes the synopsis posted October 10, 2007.  It clarifies the acquisition strategy and provides the Certificate of Non-Disclosure and Financial Interest form.  All Contractors that have pre-registered for the Pre-Solicitation Conference need not re-register.

  The following is an outline of the acquisition procedures that the U.S. Department of Transportation intends to use in preparation and execution of Solicitation No. DTOS59-08-R-00002 for the Telecommunication Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Support Services and Related Supplies (TOM 8-13) acquisition.  The construct of this acquisition is considered due diligence in protecting sensitive information related to DOT assets and infrastructure while providing adequate information and proposal opportunity for potential offerors.  This announcement is being provided for both comment and informational purposes.  Potential offerors should be cognizant and give strict adherence to the mandatory pre-registration attendance requirements applicable to both the pre-solicitation conference and the subsequent pre-proposal conference.

  This acquisition may result in two separately awarded contracts. One award will result from full and open competition consistent with 2007 NAICS Codes 517210, and 517919.  The focus will be on meeting the core telecommunications/PBX assets for O&M support services within DOT headquarters located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  Core offerors are required to have an established Nortel certified relationship in order to receive an award.  The second award will be set-aside for a small business to provide non-core telecommunication O&M support services, such as infrastructure/closets management and connectivity, cabling, moves, additions and changes.  Non-core offers will only be accepted from 8(a), Hub Zoned and Service Disabled Veteran owned companies consistent with NAICS Codes 517919 and 541618.  While the Government anticipates making two awards under this single acquisition, the Government reserves the unilateral right to make only one award should it be determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  Non-core offerors are not precluded from submitting proposals for both the core and non-core awards.  It should be noted that the Government intends to closely monitor post award work to assure that the small business actually performs more than 50% of the work for any proposed teaming arrangement, where a qualified small business teams with a large business.

  The performance period will be a base year and four one-year options.  Most of the work will be performed at firm fixed prices.  The offerors will provide the firm fixed prices.   The remaining work will be performed through fixed price contract line items (CLINs) and/or fixed labor rates for time and materials and support services task orders.  The offerors will provide fixed prices per each CLIN and fixed fully loaded rates.  The core O&M support services award shall include an approximately one month transition period between the awardee and the incumbent.

 The core and non-core O&M support services are generally separated according to the applicable Statement of Work (SOW) and are not typically inter-mixed with respect to performance.  However, these core and non-core services are expected to interface at times and are required to be mutually supportive of Government requirements in such instances.  
The non-core telecommunication O&M support services provider will generally be precluded from work typical of the core O&M support services.  More specifically, the non-core O&M support services provider will not perform core O&M support services without explicit written direction from the cognizant Contracting Officer. 
All questions and comments regarding this synopsis are due by 12:00 noon, Thursday, November 1, 2007 and shall be directed to Ms. Clementine Caudle-Wright, U.S. Department of Transportation, OST Acquisition Services Division, M-63, W83-311, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590.  Please note that responses to all questions and comments received by the due date will be provided at the Pre-Solicitation Conference that will be held on Monday, November 5, 2007, at the DOT Headquarters Building Conference Rooms 8, 9, and 10, located at a secured building at 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington DC, 20590.   
The TOM 8-13 acquisition requires a Pre-Solicitation Conference registration and a signed Non-Disclosure submission are required for participation at the conference.  All interested offerors shall register no later than 12:00 noon, Thursday, November 1, 2007.   The required Pre-registration is not complete until a signed Non-Disclosure statement has been submitted and received by Ms. Kellie Feeney.  All advanced registration documents for the pre-solicitation conference will be conducted via electronic mail, and submitted to Ms. Kellie Feeney at the following email address: kellie.feeney@dot.gov.

All participants must allow enough time to clear security and be escorted to the designated Conference room where the doors will open at 9:00AM local.  Attendees will be required to sign-in, in order to receive the Draft Statement of Work.  
Please NOTE:  Pre-registration is required for admission to the Pre-Solicitation Conference. NO recording devices will be permitted at the conference session.  The session will begin at 9:30AM local time.   The Pre-Solicitation Conference will include a presentation regarding the DOT telecommunications assets and infrastructure requirement and information concerning the Draft solicitation.  All questions should be held until the conclusion of the presentation.
A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held with offerors who registered and attended the initial Pre-Solicitation Conference only. The Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on December 10, 2007 at 9:30 AM, in the Oklahoma City Conference Room at the DOT Headquarters Building, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590. Conference room doors will open at 9:00 AM.  Pre-proposal Conference registration is due by 12:00 noon Monday, December 8, 2007. Registration for the Pre-Proposal Conference will be via electronic mail to Ms. Feeney at kellie.feeney@dot.gov.

Attendees will be required to complete and sign another Non-Disclosure statement, even having done so for the pre-solicitation conference.  Please note that pre-registration is required for pre-proposal conference admission, no recording devices are not permitted.

The Pre-proposal conference will include a considerable amount of additional details regarding the DOT telecommunications assets and infrastructure requirement.  Attendees will be given the opportunity to ask questions.  All questions and answers will be released to registered attendees only.  Key milestones of the TOM 8-13 acquisition process will also be discussed at the Pre-Proposal Conference.
  
The Government contemplates a proposal due date of January 31, 2008 at 1400.  The actual proposal due date will be included in the solicitation.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
Project Title:  2nd Floor Courtroom Renovation
Location:  Sidney L. Christie Federal Building, 845 Fifth Avenue, Huntington, WV 25701
Solicitation Number:  GS-03P-07-CD-C-0062

Provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for renovation of existing 2nd floor courtroom.  The construction firm will be required to include existing finishes which are painted plaster walls, gypsum wall board ceiling, and carpet floors over original cork flooring on poured in place concrete.  The courtroom has significant standing and running stained ornamental trim, fixed bench seating, and guard rail.  The ceiling has ornamental dentil plaster molding and trim throughout.  Further work includes modification to juror box and associated window treatments, HVAC, and lighting.  Lastly, the work also includes providing an empty conduit system for audio and video systems.

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.   Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, management and key personnel qualifications, technical and organizational approach, and on their price proposals.

The acquisition shall consist of four (4) phases:  Phase 1 ? Receipt and evaluation of technical offers and of initial price proposals.  Phase 2 ? Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors on the basis of GSA's opinion.  GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 ? A determination of the competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 ? Completion of negotiations with firms in the competitive range, if necessary.  Receipt and evaluation of final proposal revisions.  

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 3, without negotiations.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications, and 3. Technical and Organizational Approach.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220.  The construction range for this project is estimated between $250,000 and $500,000.  This unrestricted procurement is being conducted under full and open competitive provisions in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The purpose of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program is to assess the ability of small businesses to compete successfully in certain industry categories without competition being restricted by the use of small business set-asides.

POC: Selma Matthews, 703-704-3377, selma.matthews@armypower.army.mil or Mary Ellen Roth, 703-704-0616, Maryellen.roth@us.army.mil.  Topics 1-3 of the basic BAA remain unchanged as a result of this amendment.  The complete BAA is available at the C-E LCMC Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/.  It is necessary for all potential offerors to access the IBOP to read the complete BAA, submission procedures, evaluation criteria and to submit whitepapers and prop osals.   In order to access the BAA and submit a proposal a contractor must first be registered on the IBOP.  A CAGE Code and DUNS number are required to complete registration for proposal submissions.  A contractor employee who is authorized to bind the c ontractor must complete the registration.  The process could take several days to finalize the registration and contractors are encouraged to register as soon as possible. This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of  the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open  competition and fully compliant with PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  Prospective offerors should note that this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation c osts generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bi d and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired.  Potential offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted contracting officer may obligate the government to an agreement involving the expenditure of Government funds.  Any resultant contract award would include all clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulations and appropriate supplements.  This BAA is intended for the developmen t of research efforts in support of the RDEC Army Power Division.  Specific information on program goals is provided in the following section, Program Description.  In order for any proposals to be considered, the proposed effort MUST meet the definition o f basic or applied research and development found at FAR 35.001.  This BAA is being evaluated using a two step process.  Prospective offerors will first submit a white paper for evaluation.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort and expense by potential offerors in preparing a full technical and cost proposal for efforts not considered responsive or for efforts deemed to have a low over all probability of obtaining support.  Submission of White Papers is mandatory prior to submission of a full proposal.  The selection of one or more proposals for award will be based on a peer and scientific evaluation of each offerors response (to include  both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.  White Papers/Proposals shall be submitted in electronic format via the IBOP.  The IBOP submittal shall include an electronic signature by an  individual having authority to enter into a contract.  There will be no formal request for proposal or any further solicitation document issued in regard to this BAA.  Therefore, interested parties should be alert for any amendments that may be published.   Amendments to this BAA will be issued through the IBOP at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  It is therefore recommended that Offerors join the specific mailing list under BAA W909MY-07-R-0016.  Once registered on the solicitation specific mailing list a v endor will receive email notification of any updates relating to the BAA.  Offerors may submit questions related to this BAA electronically using the Question format available in the Army IBOP BAA Power Technology solicitation folder. Questions of a techni cal nature may be address to the project lead, specified below, until such time as a white paper has been submitted.  All questions of a contractual nature and all questions after white paper submission must be directed to the Contracting Office Point of C ontacts specified at the IBOP.    ALL POTENTIAL OFFERORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT DUE TO UNANTICIPATED BUDGET FLUCTUATIONS, FUNDING IN ANY OR ALL AREAS CAN CHANGE WITH LITTLE OR NO NOTICE.

(d)     The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.

(e)     Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.   The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is requesting information to determine the availability of interested small businesses to compete for a contract to provide Technical Reports Preparation Support Services for the National Toxicology Program (NTP).  The Contractor shall serve as a resource to the NTP for the preparation of documents describing toxicology and carcinogenicity studies of selected chemicals.  Two principal reports series are to be produced.  These reports are (1) NTP Technical Reports which are book-length monographs (approximately 150 to 300 pages), and which provide background information on the biologic effects of a particular substance or set of chemicals and full details on the conduct, results, and interpretation of long-term (generally 2-year) NTP studies of the effects of the test chemical in rodents.  The subject matter of these reports include toxicology, animal physiology, histologic and clinical pathology, chemistry, genetics, and statistics, and may also on occasion include pharmacology, molecular biology, and other related disciplines.  (2) A second series, NTP Toxicity Reports, describes a variety of short-term toxicity studies in rodents.  These reports are generally shorter in length (50 to 150 pages) and involve the same subject areas as in (1) the Technical Reports.  The Contractor shall work in concert with NTP staff scientists and contractors to provide technical writing, copy editing, proofreading, word processing, desktop publishing, graphics, file research, and record keeping services.  The Contractor shall engage in report preparation activities for approximately 20 to 30 reports in various stages at one time.  Each report will be prepared in a series of four or five drafts, each incorporating text, materials, and revisions from NTP staff.  Each report will be presented for outside peer review at one of the intermediate draft stages; reviews of Technical Reports are conducted in public session.  The Contractor shall provide a PDF file of the report for each draft stage and shall also prepare PDF and/or HTML files of the public review drafts and the final reports for display on the NIEHS World Wide Web servers and of the final revision of the report for use by printers.  Approximately 24 reports total shall be presented for review and printed each year; the Contractor should expect to commence preparation of approximately two reports per month and to deliver approximately two drafts per week.  The contractor shall archive all materials received, maintain a log of all materials received and delivered, and submit a biweekly status report detailing the status of each report in preparation and the cumulative labor hours spent on each report.  All materials sent to the Contractor are considered the property of the Government, and upon completion of a report and delivery of the final version and files, the Contractor shall return to the Project Officer any of the materials as specified.  Each report shall follow a standard format and will contain a cover, various front matter, and separate sections for an Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, References, and various Appendixes.  Page layout will include text, tables (both embedded in pages of text and multi-page data sets), line art graphics, and photomicrographs with captions.  Reports are to be prepared with a desktop publishing package (e.g., QuarkXPress or Adobe Pagemaker) with the capability to incorporate the entire report, including all headings, text, tables, line art images, and photomicrographs, into a single file.  The Contractor shall be able to produce hard copies, electronic files, and Portable Document (PDF) and/or hypertext machine language (HTML) files of the entire report, or sections thereof, for use by Program.  The Contractor shall be able to receive and capture electronic files with text, graphics, and tables from a variety of sources, platforms, and programs.  Electronic data accessing methods will include reading disks, e-mail attachments (originating both from Macintosh and PC platforms), and World Wide Web sites.  These files may be in a variety of formats and programs, including but not limited to MS Word or Word Perfect (various versions) for text files, Excel spreadsheets, and TIFF, GIF or JPEG files for photographs.  The Contractor should also be able to read and capture text with citations incorporated in reference libraries (e.g., EndNote).  The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of transcription of any electronically converted or hand-keyed text or data.  On occasion the Contractor may be asked to prepare graphical displays of data (e.g., time plots or bar graphs) or chemical structures and metabolism pathways.  These should be prepared as transportable files with programs such as Photoshop for line art, Freehand for graphics, and Chem Draw or ISIS/Draw for chemical structures and not be embedded in a proprietary format.  The contractor shall have the capability of scanning line art graphics (e.g., chemistry spectra, schematic diagrams) into electronic files at a resolution of 600-1200 dpi.  In the event that photographs (rather than digital files) of photomicrographs are provided, the contractor shall have the capability of scanning the photograph at the original quality and producing a TIFF file at a final resolution of 300 dpi for color images or with gray tones for black and white images.  During the report preparation process the Contractor shall be able to extract portions of entire sections or the report and send them as electronic files to NTP staff for review. The Contractor will certify that a written, enforced administrative process to identify, manage, reduce and eliminate conflicting financial interest is currently in effect.  The anticipated effective date of the subsequent award is November 1, 2008.  The performance period for the base contract is expected to be 60 months.  Should the Government choose to exercise the time extension options for continued support; the period may be extended to October 31, 2018.  For estimating purposes the Government anticipated an approximate level-of-effort of 11 person-years per year for the contract and each one-year option.

<DESC>This notice is issued by NASA JSC WSTF as a Market Research/Request for Information (RFI) This RFI is a continuation of a previous RFI entitled, “Feasibility Study for Development of Stress Rupture Data from Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels”, (Reference Number:  NNJ07COPV) which closed on October 3, 2007. Please note that previous respondents to NNJ07COPV are required to respond to the new RFI.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information from vendors for Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV’S) regarding the costs and delivery times required to design, analyze, and build COPV’s per the requested specifications.  Information is requested for vessels that will represent flight materials and processes.  Vessels shall be manufactured of space flight proven resin systems and flight certified carbon fibers.  It is preferred that information be given for vessels used to establish an A-basis allowable per ANSI/AIAA S-081A-2006.  NASA’s immediate need for this capability is to perform accelerated tests to obtain data on approximately 140 small scale test articles for the determination of the best reliability models to use for the design and qualification of flight vessels.  Consequently, the goal of this RFI is to survey industry interest in accommodating the delivery of small scale carbon wrapped COPV’s for stress rupture life testing in support of NASA’s new fleet of manned exploration vehicles.  COPV’s for various configurations aboard the fleet of vehicles are being considered and time at pressure (stress rupture) data development is desired. CEV COPV Background The CEV is a crew launch vehicle that will be used to replace the Shuttle for support of the International Space Station and will also be used for the Constellation program for future lunar missions.	The CEV will have many COPV’s for both the propulsion and environmental control systems.	The propulsion system COPV’s will consist of pressurization and propellant vessels.	The pressurization COPV’s will store high pressure gases and the propellant COPV’s will store liquids for fuel and oxidizers at lower pressures.  The environmental control system COPV’s will consist of high pressure vessels for the storage of high pressure GN2 and GO2.  The following Figure shows a preliminary schematic for a high pressure GHe pressurization system. COPV Requested Specifications It must be noted that some of the following specifications are set forth as target goals based on estimations from the Crew Exploration Vehicle COPV Working Group.  Further discussions and meetings will be scheduled to address these specifications with vendors before the responses are submitted. Shape:			Cylindrical COPV Fill Ports:		2 boss ports with MS thread form  Liner:			Seamless Al 6061-T6 0.030 in Thick Tolerance on the thickness in the cylinder section is +/-0.003 Fiber:			Toray T-1000 The minimum tensile strength for fiber tests shall be 800 ksi.	Tensile strength tests shall be performed on spools on wrapping machines before test articles are wrapped and these tests must show a minimum strength of 800 ksi. Volume Fiber Ratio:		0.65 +/- 0.05 Target Design Burst Pressure:	6,000 to 10,000 psig Target Diameter:		4.0 to 8.0 in.  Cylinder Length:		Minimum cylinder length shall be 4.0 in. Proof pressure: 			Proof tests shall be performed after delivery to NASA Wrapping Pattern:	Minimum of 4 hoop wraps coupled with sufficient helical wraps to meet burst pressure requirement Burst Tests:	Burst tests shall be performed on 20 vessels to determine the variability Test Temperature:	70°F to 80°F Quantity:	140  Tentative RFI Schedule  Event or Task Date CEV COPV Stress Rupture Life Test Article RFI Release 10/12/2007 Technical Discussions with Vendors Via Telecons       10/17/2007 to 10/31/2007 RFI Responses Due				      11/15/2007 RFI Response Content Instructions At a minimum, the RFI response should include the following: 1.0	A statement indicating your company’s interest in the fabrication and delivery of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels for stress rupture life tests.  2.0	A list of tasks that your company believes it will need to perform to accommodate the delivery of the proposed COPV’s per the requested specifications.

<DESC>Background: The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the identification of potential bioagents outside of a typical laboratory setting has become an integral part of biodefense and biosecurity measures. This tool has the capability to detect the presence of specific nucleic acids at low levels, which frequently infers the presence of target organism. This presumption can be further strengthened if the genetic sequence of the PCR product (amplified fragment) is determined. DNA sequencing is currently a labor intensive process that must be performed in a laboratory, and this capability is not available for field-use.
Description: Virginia Contracting Activity is seeking to identify qualified sources to perform a feasibility study and then develop a compact, lightweight, portable, rugged (field-ready), genetic sequencer. The instrument must be capable of performing genetic sequencing with commercially available molecular biology reagents and consumables. The instrument must be rugged enough to circumvent the need to recalibrate and recertify the interrogation and readout systems (e.g., lasers) each time the unit is moved. Further, the instrument must have the option of running on alternative power (e.g. batteries) and be able to endure a variety of conditions such as extreme hot (>100?F), cold (<58 ?F), dry, dusty, and humid environments. The system must have an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) or be compatible with a laptop computer or PDA. The system protocol must have minimal processing time and effort-starting from the purification of PCR products, down to the actual DNA sequencing.
Requested Information: Interested and capable firms are asked to submit information (no more than 20 pages) outlining the following: 1) Company information, which includes point of contact. address, type of company. size. and security clearance; 2) description of expertise in the development of genetic sequencing technologies; this includes current work and related accomplishments; 3) description of genetic sequencers developed (or being developed) by the company, including prototypes with detailed specifications and testing data; 4) description of facilities and technical capabilities to perform the R&D leading to the fabrication of a prototype within 24 months.
This is a sources sought synopsis for market research only. Any information submitted by respondents as a result of this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), Administrative Resource Center (ARC), on behalf of the Federal Consulting Group (FCG), is assessing the market to gain information on contractors that can provide a capable staff and the necessary resources for developing and implementing statistically-based customer satisfaction models for participating government websites.  The Contractor must use its unique web-based approach to deploy a methodology that will enable federal managers to measure and manage the success of government websites based on the voice of the citizen.  In addition, for each participating government website, the Contractor must produce final aggregate, time series, benchmark comparison, response distribution, and segmentation reports for the corresponding government agency.  Furthermore, during the subscription period, the Contractor must help federal government agencies realize the following benefits of the Contractor's methodology:

1. Contractor must use a nation-wide, uniform and scientifically established measure of customer satisfaction to evaluate and manage the performance of federal government websites. 

2. Contractor must provide actionable results to drive decision-making that best support federal managers goals and objectives and help them determine how best to allocate resources to meet their defined goals.

Contractor must allow the government to utilize a standard measurement of quality that is comparable across government agencies, across multiple service delivery channels (e.g., face-to-face, call center, website, etc.), and to private sector industries and organizations measured by the Contractor and its chosen methodology.

The Contractor must be able to perform the following services in support of website assessment and improvement:

1. Develop customized econometric models for participating agency websites based on a proven statistical methodology;
2. Prepare and implement statistically-based on-line surveys to obtain model-related, demographic and other data from users of federal websites;
3. Ensure surveys are presented to the smallest possible number of random web visitors using a "pop up" or equivalent approach, not an "opt in" approach which would adversely affect the statistical validity of the survey;
4. Collect and process the survey data through customized, satisfaction models to derive scores for website quality elements (i.e., such as content, look and feel, search, navigation, and functionality, etc.), overall customer satisfaction, and future behaviors;
5. Analyze the results of the survey and develop appropriate on-line reports, charts and graphs;
6. Identify specific opportunities for improvements in areas customers have indicated are key drivers of satisfaction and where current customer satisfaction levels are low;
7. Determine if major website design and/or redesign is achieving the results expected;
8. Evaluate and present results to the agency staff which would include findings of the customer satisfaction measurement and actions that can be taken to improve customer satisfaction with the website; and
9. Support agency-specific requirements for custom questions, custom question clustering based on a statistical methodology, web visitor qualification, page-level surveys, skip logic surveys, usability audit reviews, and ad hoc reporting.

ARC is requesting information that will demonstrate the vendor's ability to meet the requirements listed above.  Please note that this information is being requested for information and planning purposes only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested.  ARC will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above based on the information received.  Dependent upon the results of this market survey, ARC may issue a solicitation to acquire the services.

<SUBJECT>D -- Adaptable Computing Environment/Self Assembling Software
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is seeking partnership relationships, consisting of license(s) and/or CRADA agreements with third parties to enable further development of The Adaptable Computing Environment (ACE) under the self-assembling software (SAS) technology platform.  The successful partner will have demonstrated ability in developing and bringing to market software platforms based on the Forth programming language.

The Adaptable Computing Environment (ACE) is a software environment?a platform or ?shell? that runs on Windows. When ACE is completed, the user will be able to adapt the system, make new parts of the system interactive, and even modify the behavior of the system itself, by invoking commands directly on the graphical user interface (GUI). The code to execute these commands is self-assembled under-the-hood using our self-assembling software (SAS) technology. SAS is a biologically inspired computing architecture, in which software agents dynamically self-assemble and execute code in response to stimuli such as GUI events. The system, written in the Forth programming language, is partially implemented. Some key features that have been implemented are (a) books in bookcases, where all data is stored, (b) context-sensitive compass menus (compass, because the buttons are located in compass directions relative to the mouse cursor position), (c) importing tabular data and displaying it in a book, (d) light-weight table querying/sorting, (e) a Reach&Get capability (sort of a "smart" copy/paste that prevents the user from copying invalid data), (f) a Logbook that automatically logs user actions and system results. Some development tools have also been implemented that enable a developer to modify the system using a mix of user interface and Forth programming. As mentioned above, significant Forth programming knowledge and expertise would be required to complete implementation of the end-user GUI-based adaptability.

<SUBJECT>R -- Award for Detention Services in Clayton County, Georgia
<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) intends to award a fixed priced contract using only one responsible source, The GEO, Group, Incorporated (GEO), requires the use of non-competitive procedures for obtaining private contract detention and related services in the State of Georgia to house persons in custody of the United States Marshals Service (USMS).  These comprehensive detention services will serve a population principally consisting of individuals charged with federal offenses and detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, a hearing on immigration status, or deportation.  

Contract performance requires the management and operation of a Contractor-owned/Contractor-operated detention facility for federal detainees.  The population will be individuals charged with federal offenses and detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, a hearing on their immigration status, or deportation.  OFDT will award a contract that allows the USMS, to house prisoners at the facility. The facility shall be provided to accommodate at least 576 USMS prisoners at a single site.

The facility shall be located within the geographic and political boundaries of the State of Georgia.  The facility shall be located within appropriate proximity and access to emergency services (medical, fire protection, law enforcement, etc.). The government intends on awarding a Fixed-Price contract type for, all necessary personnel, equipment, materials, supplies, and services do all things necessary for, or incident to, the management and operation of comprehensive detention services. 

On April 23, 2007, Clayton County, Georgia signed a competitive 20-year lease with GEO for the Robert A. Deyton Detention Facility.  Clayton County issued a competitive Request for Proposal on August 16, 2006 and received three (3) offers from three (3) qualified vendors.  After an internal review by the county?s review committee it was recommended unanimously that the Board of County Commissioners approve the lease to GEO.  On March 20, 2007 at a public hearing the Commissioners authorized the lease.

No other existing facility is in place for this procurement action, competition would require construction of a new facility.  New Construction would require a study of the potential environmental impacts, proposed mitigation, and any other relevant information pertaining to the impacts of the construction and operation of the proposed any facility.  Greater consideration would be given to the offer which represents the Aenvironmentally preferable@ alternative.   Environmentally preferable alternative means, the proposal that has a lesser or reduced negative effect on the human environment when compared with competing proposals.  Clearly, an existing facility would have less effect or no effect on the environment.  
Non-Federal Detention bed space for federal detainees is acquired through Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs), where a daily rate is paid to State and local governments.  If an Intergovernmental Agreement is not available, a facility specific contract is established with a private service provider. 

To help overcome some of the challenges and to control costs in acquiring non-federal detention services, the Department of Justice Appropriations Act for 2001  (Public Law 106-553) contained the following provision:

ASec. 119; Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including section 4(d) of the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 353(d)), the Attorney General hereafter may enter into contracts and other agreements, of any reasonable duration, for detention or incarceration space or facilities, including related services, on any reasonable basis.@

This authority is designed to allow for the use of non-traditional contract vehicles when acquiring detention and other related services.  Section 119 grants the Attorney General the authority to enter into contracts Aof any reasonable duration, for detention or incarceration space or facilities, including related services, on any reasonable basis@.  The concluding phrase Aon any reasonable basis@ is interpreted within the ordinary meaning to encompass all pertinent terms and conditions, which would be reasonable to include in a justified non-competitive basis.

Any interested party in this action may submit questions to Scott Stermer, Assistant Trustee for Procurement at scott.stermer2@usdoj.gov, no later November 15, 2007.

The first issue is the meaning of the term produced in the United States with respect to hand tools.  Our higher headquarters has sought and received input from the Department of Defense regarding the meaning of that clause.  In accordance with input fr om our higher headquarters, and in a change from the position previously announced during Industry day, our new position is:  Hand and measuring tools must have one hundred percent (100%) domestic content- to include all components of the tools.   The following is draft guidance that PM-SKOT is seeking industry comments upon: 	For tool sets which have a Federal Supply Classification (FSC) of 51 or 52, but which contain items which are not hand and measuring tools, PM-SKOT will look to the nature of the individual item to determine if the prohibition on foreign purchase of hand or measuring tools applies.  For instance, if a tool set has an FSC beginning with 51, but contains an item with an FSC beginning with 49, the prohibition on the purchase of foreign hand and measuring tools does not apply to the purchase of the item with a n FSC of 49.  In simpler terms, the prohibition on the purchase of hand and measuring tools applies to hand and measuring tools, not other items. 	For tool sets which have an FSC other than 51 or 52, but which contain hand or measuring tools, the Berry Amendment still applies to those hand or measuring tools.  PM-SKOT will not purchase foreign hand or measuring tools (i.e. FSC 51 or 52 items) regard less of the FSC of the set.  In some sets, the hand and measuring tools included have no designated FSC.  PM-SKOT will attempt to correct this.  If there is any doubt as to whether an item is a hand or measuring tool, please contact the contracting officer , who will then issue a ruling that applies to all offerors. PM-SKOT will add the following language to all solicitations with tools subject to the Berry Amendment restrictions: The Berry Amendment (DFARS Clause 252.225-7015) forbids the purchase of non U.S. hand and measuring tools (FSC 51 and 52).  Market research has indicated that there are certain tools, notably ____ and ___________, in the _(name of the set)_____________ tha t are not manufactured in the U.S.  The Berry Amendment does allow for exceptions if the items are being purchased for use in support of contingency operations; or to meet an urgent and compelling need, or the cost is below the simplified acquisition thres hold.  The contractor shall be required to obey the restrictions of the Berry Amendment and supply only domestic tools unless a specific exception has been invoked by the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).  Again, only the PCO may invoke an exception to the limitation on the purchase of hand and measuring tools.  When market research has shown these items to be domestically unavailable and the contracting officer has already determined that they will be used in support of contingency operations; or to mee t an urgent and compelling need, or the cost is below the simplified acquisition threshold, then offerors may purchase them from non-U.S. sources, subject to the Buy American Act (DFARS part 225.1) and any other applicable limitations, including prohibitio ns on purchases from certain foreign countries For this procurement, the  contracting officer has determined that ________ and _________ are domestically unavailable, and that they are to be used in support of a contingency operation.  The contracting officer hereby invokes the contingency operations exception for these tools. If an offeror is not able to obtain any other particular tool from a domestic source, the contractor is required to so inform the contracting officer and clearly identify that item in the offer, price the item and indicate the country of origin.  The contr acting officer may then open for discussions.  If discussions reveal that no offeror can obtain the tools from a domestic source, then the contracting officer may then decide to apply an exception to that tool.  If there is only one domestic source of that  tool, the contracting officer may either remove that tool from the list of items to be provided by the offerors and purchase it separately as GFM, or invoke an exception, or choose to take no action.

          Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
         (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
         Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
         Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
         Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
         (1)     The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
         (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 
         (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
         (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
         (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
         Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
         (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
         (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
         (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
         (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
         (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
         (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
         (d) Special rule for related partnerships.     For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
         (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
         (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
         (i) Warrants; 
         (ii) Options; 
         (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
         (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
         (v) Others similar interests. 
         (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
         (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>NOTICE OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER SAQMMA07R0048


Provided below are the questions that have been submitted as of October 15, 2007 under Solicitation Number SAQMMA07R0048 for Commercial Lease of Administrative Vehicles. The answers are provided following each question.  All instructions and deadlines remain the same as set forth in Amendment 03.  If there are any subsequent questions, they will be posted in the same manner as these.

1. Question: On what criteria will you be evaluating proposals for award recommendation?

Answer: Price reasonableness

2. Question: In order to properly provide pricing it will be necessary to know which states each model will be registered in other than the District of Columbia.  Every state has different tax rates.

Answer: Vehicle registration is up to the service provider; the vehicle may be registered in any state desired.

3. Question: The government does not have a federal standard labeled "large executive" or "premium executive".  Will you please give us examples of each classification?

Answer: Representative examples of large executive sedans include, but are not limited to: Chrysler 300 and Ford Crown Victoria. Representative examples of premium executive sedans include, but are not limited to: Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac STS.

4. Question: Do you want specs of all the vehicles? If so, what specs? 

Answer: No, makes and models are fine.

5. Are you requesting vehicles to be delivered within 15 days of the order or can they be factory ordered? (Factory orders normally take 6 to 8 weeks for delivery).
Answer: The Statement of Work states in part, ?The Lessor will then provide vehicles to the COR within 15 days of issuance of the call by the CO, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Lessor and the COR, in which case a ?not later than? delivery date will be specified in the call.? Our intent is to take possession of the vehicle within 15 days. If one vendor can?t provide it from whatever means are at his/her disposal, then we?ll go to the next vendor. If none can meet the 15 days, then we?ll go with whichever vendor we determine will provide the best value, based on cost and timeliness of delivery past 15 days.



6. Question: Are you requiring certain options on certain vehicles, as an example do you need leather interior or GPS navigation as part of your standard specifications? 
Answer: The Statement of Work states in part, ?The DOS will specify vehicle type and desired options on each call; Lessor may provide any manufacturer model vehicle that meets both DOS requirements and ?Buy American Act? regulations.  Vehicles may be any color (black, dark blue, or white preferred), with the exception that large executive and premium executive sedans must be black or dark blue.  

Vehicles will be provided with flexible fuel gas/ethanol (E85) capability when available from manufacturers in the type and class of vehicle ordered.
The Lessor may offer and the COR may accept substitution of specific vehicle types/options other than those initially requested by the COR when agreed to by the COR in advance and at no additional cost to the government.?

7.  Question: You request that lessor pay all vehicle title, registration and licensing fees. Where will the vehicles be garaged? Won?t Government tags be issued at the inception of the lease in order to alleviate any cost associated with registering the vehicles? 
Answer: Vehicles will be primarily garaged in the DC Metro area but requirements may arise in any of the 50 states; the COR would determine the Service Provider?s ability to meet any out-of-area requirements prior to placing an order.
SOW states in part, 

?LICENSING FEES AND TAXES
Lessor shall pay all vehicle title, registration and licensing fees, charges and taxes.

LICENSE PLATES
All vehicles provided by the Lessor will be properly licensed, at the Lessor?s expense, in accordance with procedures specified by the state in which the vehicle is registered.  The DOS reserves the right to replace Lessor vehicle license plates with official federal government vehicle license plates.  The DOS will ensure the security of license plates removed from Lessor vehicles and will replace the Lessor plates on the vehicle prior to return to the Lessor at the end of the lease period.? 

8. Question:   Annual miles estimated? 

Answer:  6000-8000 miles per vehicle per year

9. Question:   Taxes and tags - DC or VA? 

Answer: Vendor choice location for vehicles to be based. Address of record will be Main State, but vehicles could be used/garaged anywhere in the DC Metro area. We may have a requirement anywhere in the US, but we?d work that out with the vendor ahead of time to ensure they could meet the requirement.





10. Question:  How many vehicle types -sub compact, compact, mid-size, large, 
executive type? How many 7-passenger and 15-passenger vans? How many Cargo vans - small and full size? How many Pickups -small, mid-size and full size?

Answer: The quantities will depend on mission requirements. The only one we have a pretty good handle on to start is that we will need 14 large executive sedans (Grand Marquis, Fort LTD 4-door type).  We don?t anticipate leasing more than 20 vehicles in total at any given time.
    
11. Question: Any preference with GM, Ford, Chrysler or can there be mix of 
manufacturer?   What about Honda and Toyota? 

Answer:  GM, Ford, Chrysler strongly preferred, but regardless, vehicles provided must meet Buy American Act requirements

12. Question: May the contract awardee later provide vehicles that are not in the original proposal providing the pricing is agreeable?

Answer: Yes, provided also that any vehicle proposed for provision to DOS meets the requirements of the statement of work.

13. Question: In the "Ordering" paragraph you indicate that "the Lessor will notify the COR... of vehicle delivery lead-in time for each vehicle requested."  You then state that "the Lessor will then provide vehicles to the COR with 15 days of issue of the call unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Lessor and the COR..."  If vehicles are to be factory ordered, there will be a 6-8 week lead-in.  The 15 day requirement argues against ordering new vehicles for this contract.  Is it the Government's expectation that the Lessor will be able to order new vehicles and the Government will wait for delivery, or does the Government have the expectation that vehicles will be delivered within the 15 day timeframe?

Answer: The government?s preference is that requirements be met within 15 days whenever possible, through whatever means are available to the service provider (such as through sub-leasing agreements or procurement from dealer inventory). However, understanding the difficulty in meeting this requirement (especially when ?special? order items might be desired), the allowance is made in the agreement for the service provider and the COR to agree on delivery past 15 days.

14. Question: Under "Vehicle Replacement," if a large executive or premium executive vehicle is leased for 36 months and is turned in after 24 months, is it the Government's expectation that for the remainder of the 36 months, the Lessor will provide a new (i.e. two year newer model) at the same price as for the two year older vehicle being replaced?

Answer: No

15. Question: Under "Maintenance, you indicate that the 'Lessor will notify DOS when each vehicle is due for preventive maintenance."  As this maintenance is typically mileage driven as well as time driven, will DOS provide monthly cumulative mileage reports on every vehicle so that the Lessor can monitor same?  And do you expect on-site maintenance by the Lessor, or will it suffice to have an extended maintenance package under which you can have the maintenance done at any dealer?

Answer: DOS will provide periodic odometer readings to the service provider to assist in maintenance scheduling when requested by the service provider. No vehicle maintenance will be done on site. Where and how the vehicles are maintained is up to the Service Provider to determine, as long as the contract periodicity and distance requirements are met.

16. Question: Is this a new requirement?  If not, who is the incumbent?

Answer: This is not a new requirement, however more or fewer vehicles may be ordered at inception of the contract and at any time during the period of performance to meet changing mission requirements. Currently, some vehicles are being leased through a short-term purchase order arrangement, but we have no long-term contract in place at this time for this requirement.

17. Question: Will the Lessor be responsible for picking the vehicle up at Main State, getting it serviced, and then returning it?

Answer: The DOS will deliver vehicles to and retrieve vehicles from service provider designated repair facilities. DOS will also coordinate service/maintenance directly with the service provider designated maintenance facility upon notification from the service provider that a vehicle is due for service.

18. Question: Are you expecting that the Lessor will do maintenance on-site or will you accept an extended maintenance contract with the manufacturer which will allow the maintenance to be done at any of the manufacturer's dealers?

Answer: No vehicle maintenance will be done on site. Where and how the vehicles are maintained is up to the Service Provider to determine, as long as the contract periodicity and distance requirements are met.
