<DESC>Request for Information: Rapid Airfield Damage Assessment System (RADAS) - Sensor &amp; Data Processing<br />Agency: Department of the Air Force<br />Office: Air Force Materiel Command<br />Location: ESC - Electronic Systems Center<br /><br />TITLE: Request for Information (RFI) in support of planning/acquisition strategy development for Rapid Airfield Damage Assessment System (RADAS).
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is a Government effort in accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to conduct Market Research to support potential future planning initiatives through data collection. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. <br />All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable or suffer any consequential damage for any proprietary information not identified. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.<br />Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Air Force will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of the RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to the RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.<br />BACKGROUND: <br />The objective of the Rapid Airfield Damage Assessment System (RADAS) is to support post-attack recovery actions by rapidly assessing airfield damage and by identifying Minimum Operating Surface (MOS) /Minimum Airfield Operating Surface (MAOS) candidates for repair actions. RADAS will reduce the timeline required to assess airfield damage and restore airfield operations. RADAS will also reduce risk to personnel from unexploded ordnance by providing a stand-off capability for assessment to replace the current manual Airfield Damage Assessment Team (ADAT) process.<br />Specific paved surface areas, such as runways and select taxiways are high priority attack targets which create a vulnerability to Air Force operations. This vulnerability is further amplified as the USAF moves to expeditionary environments, where airbases are increasingly exposed to enemy attacks.<br />Recovering the airfield to support critical aircraft operations becomes a top priority subsequent to an attack. Hundreds of damage items may be found on an airfield following an attack. ADAT uses a process that prioritizes the necessary repairs in order of most pragmatic to resume aircraft operations. Typical airfield damage items from conventional weaponry are listed in Table 1. <br />The RADAS capability commences when the attack is over and is completed when three alternative MAOS candidates are identified <br />The RADAS capability includes the post-attack assessment of damage to runways, taxiways, ramps, and adjacent in-fields. See Table 2 for definition of areas to be assessed post-attack.</p>
<p><br />The RADAS capability will:<br />1. Identify damage: <br />a. Detect attack damage [craters, spalls, and camouflets] including the presence of unexploded ordnance (UXOs)<br />b. Identify damage location - georeferenced locations of damage/UXOs<br />c. Classify damage/UXOs classification, including size and type [crater, spall, camouflets, UXO])<br />2. Report damage via a data interface to the government owned Geospatial Expeditionary Planning Tool (GeoExPT).Technical information for the GeoExPT data interface is implemented via Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Shapefile format; additional interface detail is identified in RADAS Requirement E1.</p>
<p>The following step is included for clarity but will be performed by GeoExPT, which should be considered GFE for this RFI. <br />3. The GeoExPT Airfield Damage Importer module monitors a user-definable file folder for damage shapefiles and notifies the user of new damage shapefiles available for import.</p>
<p>Table 1. List and Description of Airfield Damage<br />Type Description <br />Crater The pit, depression, or cavity formed in the surface of the earth by an explosion. It may range from saucer shaped to conical, depending largely on the depth of burst. Crater Diagram<br /><br />Crater in Concrete<br /><br />Spalls Pavement damage that does not penetrate through the pavement surface to the underlying soil layers. A spall damage area could be up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) in diameter.<br />Spall fields are clusters of spalls within a defined area. Spall in Concrete<br /><br />UXO (Unexploded Ordnance) Explosive ordnance which has been primed, fused, armed or otherwise prepared for action, and which has been fired, dropped, launched, projected or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard to operations, installations, personnel, or material and remains unexploded either by malfunction or design.<br />Bomblet fields are clusters of sub-munitions within a defined area. Unexploded Ordnance<br /><br />Camouflet Craters with relatively small apparent diameters but deep penetration and subsurface voids (in layman's terms, the munition punctures through the pavement surface and explodes in the base material). Note; munitions that penetrate the surface but do not explode will still be treated as a camouflet. Camouflet in concrete</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Table 2. Airfield Configuration definitions<br />Airfield Configuration<br /><br />Apron/Ramp A defined area, on an airfield, intended to accommodate aircraft for the purposes of loading or unloading passengers or cargo, refueling, parking, or maintenance. <br />Infield Areas (paved or unpaved) on the airfield encompassed (or surrounded by) other operational surfaces. The infield is measured from the edge of the shoulders or outer edge of the marking line if a shoulder is not present. <br />Runway A defined rectangular area of an airfield, prepared for the landing and takeoff run of aircraft along its length. Runway width is typically measured from the outer edge of the load-bearing pavement on one side to the outer edge of the load-bearing pavement on the other side. <br />Shoulders Prepared (paved or unpaved) area adjacent to the edge of an operational pavement. <br />Shoulder width is measured from the outer edge of load-bearing pavement or outer edge of the runway markings to the edge of the shoulder.<br />Taxiway A specially prepared or designated path, on an airfield or heliport other than apron areas, on which aircraft move under their own power to and from landing, takeoff, service, and parking areas. The width of a taxiway is measured to the outer edges of the load-bearing pavement, or to the edge of a marking in the case where the taxiway abuts another asset or where the taxiway utilizes existing pavements; either active, such as along an apron, or inactive, such as within the boundaries of a previous active runway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(2) ADDITIONAL REQUIRED INFORMATION ON RECOMMENDED RADAS APPROACHES/SOLUTIONS</p>
<p>(1) Describe currently available off-the shelf sensor solutions and give their specifications. Discuss how sensor technology or integrated sensor technologies (e.g., radio frequency, seismic/acoustic, electro-optical, etc) would be installed, employed and integrated into relevant platforms. Describe how fixed mount, vehicle mount or airborne mount (e.g., Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)) platforms would be employed with the sensor system and what operator training/certification would be required for operations and maintenance. Describe major initial procurement and life cycle cost drivers associated with any proposed sensor(s) and platform(s).</p>
<p>(2) Provide National Stock Numbers of sensor solutions and associated ancillary equipment for sensors that are already in the Government inventory. Give associated sensor pricing information that is listed in GSA Schedules, vendor catalogs, or publicly announced Government contracts.</p>
<p>(3) Describe possible custom sensor solutions and provide specifications. Discuss how any custom sensor technology, or integrated custom sensor technologies would be installed and integrated into relevant platforms, (e.g., radio frequency, seismic/acoustic, electro-optical, etc) would be installed, employed and integrated into relevant platforms. Describe how fixed mount, vehicle mount or airborne mount (e.g., Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)) platforms would be employed with the sensor system and what operator training/certification would be required for operations and maintenance. Describe major initial procurement and life cycle cost drivers associated with any proposed custom sensor(s) and platform (s).</p>
<p>(4) Environmental Constraints. Provide any environmental constraints on the system or impacts to its performance, i.e., rain, fog, cold, heat, humidity, wind, snow, ice, etc.</p>
<p><br />(5) Reliability, Maintainability, Availability (RMA). The government requests information which will assist with determining the sustainability of material solution concepts. Request any reliability, maintainability and availability data available. The following data would be of assistance:</p>
<p>a. Maintenance Cycles and preventive maintenance: Provide information about any required periodic maintenance, calibrations or inspections required to support the system or subsystems. Examples include sensor calibrations needed at startup, or to maintain accuracy; preventive maintenance, lubrication, corrosion or damage inspection. Describe any required periodic heavy or depot maintenance, which would be performed away from the installed location or impact the system availability for use. How many hours per month? Averaged over one year? Does any of the preventive maintenance require system shutdown? If so, for how long?<br />b. Mean Time Between Critical Failures (MTBCF) MTBCF is the measure of the average operating time between failures of mission essential system functions (critical failure). A critical failure will be considered an event where the RADAS system is not able to collect and process data to feed GeoExPT (also called a "downing event). <br />c. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) MTBF is computed by dividing the total operating time by total number of corrective maintenance actions. Corrective maintenance actions are all actions performed to restore an item to a specified condition after an unscheduled maintenance event or failure (critical and non-critical). Corrective maintenance include, but not limited to, manually re-booting/reset of a processor or computer or operating system, localizing a problem, isolating a problem, disassembling a system, interchanging components, reassembling a system, aligning parts, and checking out a system. <br />d. Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) MTTR measures the average corrective maintenance time in an operational environment. MTTR starts when the technician arrives at the system or equipment for on-equipment maintenance or receives the assembly, subassembly, module, or circuit card assembly at the off-equipment repair location. MTTR includes all maintenance done to correct the malfunction, including preparation, LRU access, troubleshooting, removing and replacing parts, repair, adjusting, and conducting functional checks. MTTR does not include maintenance, supply, or other delays. <br />e. Mean Time To Restore System (MTTRS) MTTRS encompasses the time to repair (MTTR) and any other on-equipment activity to restore the system to an operational state from an unscheduled downing event. Generally MTTRS does include administrative and logistics delay time (ALDT). Here "Active MTTRS" is that portion for MTTRS does not include ALDT. <br />f. Maximum Time to Repair (MaxTTR) The MaxTTR is based on the repair times following a log-normal distribution, where 95% of the repair times will fall within three times the MTTR.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  This pre-solicitation notice is being issued in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.204.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), intends to competitively award a contract entitled "Advanced High Temperature (HT) Coatings for HT Oilfield Downhole Applications."  The BSEE Acquisition Operations Branch is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price type contract for the effort described herein but may consider other proposed types if determined appropriate.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), and the work is multi-disciplinary.   The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be not more than 24 months.
BACKGROUND:  The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), within the Department of the Interior (DOI), became effective on October 1, 2011.  BSEE works to promote safety, protect the environment, and conserve resources offshore through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement.  BSEE is seeking expert assistance in developing and evaluating the resulting properties of high temperature (HT) coatings on HT metal substrates in temperatures greater than 350 degrees Fahrenheit, erosion-corrosion conditions, and sour gas, including H2S and CO2, environments.  As oilfield exploration has moved farther offshore, high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) environments are being encountered more frequently.  The overarching goal of the subject procurement is to better understand and parameterize the effects of HPHT downhole environments, including corrosion and erosion-corrosion, on base metals, coatings, and coating application methods.  
SCOPE OF WORK:  The selected contractor will conduct a literature review focused on identifying existing oilfield and novel base metals, coatings, coating properties, and coating application processes with potential for use in the HPHT downhole environments.  Based upon the results of the literature review, the contractor then will determine potential base metal, alloy, and coating, and coating application combinations for use on tubulars and casings in HPHT environments.  The contractor will conduct temperature, sour gas, corrosion, and erosion testing on those selected materials, evaluate the test results, and report the detailed analyses to BSEE. 
HOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT:  If your organization is interested in participating in this acquisition, please send your organization's name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, and DUNS Number via email to Frank.Bennett@bsee.gov by 8:00 a.m. Monday, 25 June 2011.  Those organizations expressing an interest in this opportunity will receive a copy of the complete solicitation upon issuance.  Reference Solicitation No. E12PS00031 on all correspondence.  All inquiries shall be submitted in writing to the email address referenced above.

<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source contract to Vaisala, Inc, 194 South Taylor Avenue, Louisville CO 80027 for delivery of cloud to ground lightning for the geographic region of the CONUS, Puerto Rico and the USVI (Zone 1).  The contract is for a term of three months commencing on July 7, 2012 with two three month options.  This data is for use by the Automated Lightning Detection and Report System (ALDARS).
In accordance with the Acquisition Management System (AMS) policy, the basis for authorizing this single source procurement is because the current FAA contract with the present provider of cloud to ground lightning data expires on July 6, 2012, which does not afford the FAA the time necessary to complete a longer term competitive source selection procurement and provide for contract overlap during start up testing. Vaisala Inc. is the sole contractor currently providing lightning data to the FAA without interruption to the legacy equipment which is essential for the safety of the flying public. A competitive solicitation was released on May 31, 2012.  This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal. 
If you have any questions or comments on this contract action, please contact the Contracting Officer, Jacqueline Haralson no later than close of business June 20, 2010 at Jacqueline.haralson@faa.gov.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a Federal Corporation created under Title VI of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2004. The MCC is headed by a Chief Executive Officer, overseen by a Board of Directors, and chaired by the Secretary of State. The mission of MCC is to reduce poverty, in foreign poor countries, through economic growth. The MCC fulfills its mission by awarding compacts (e.g., grants) to these countries. The countries are carefully selected based on their performance to govern justly, invest in their citizens, and encourage economic freedom.
<p>The MCC Department of Administration and Finance (A&amp;F), Contracts &amp; Grants Management (CGM) Division, provides acquisition support for the MCC operations. The MCC is required to follow the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) when processing contract actions. The majority of contracts awarded are for professional services, including consultants with expertise in such fields as agriculture, finance, procurement, U.S. law and/or the laws of MCC compact recipient countries, and architect &amp; engineering services. Many contracts are issued for services to be performed outside the United States. Since the MCC has authority to contract for personal services, a large number of them are procured through personal services contracts.</p>
<p>The CGM Division requires professional services from one or more contractors to provide acquisition support services to supplement its competitive service staff. Currently, the CGM Division is staffed with a Managing Director and up to twenty five (25) staff members, including ten civil service employees and 10 to 15 positions filled by contractors. This reflects a management decision to contract out (out-source) a significant portion of the acquisition staff. To that end, MCC requires an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to facilitate a sufficient pool of candidates from which to fill positions as they become vacant.</p>
<p>MCC is specifically authorized by statute to award personal service contracts as defined by FAR 2.101 and 37.104 and as necessary to meet its mission. The nature of the contract administration work under this contract necessitates direct supervision of the contractor's staff by A&amp;F supervisors. Therefore, under this contract, the contractor shall provide personal services to the MCC. However, all contractor staff will carry a "contractor" MCC identification card, identify themselves in all correspondence as contractors representing MCC, and will not be granted contracting officer signatory authority.</p>
<p>All positions require the ability to work in a fast-paced, often stressful, environment with tight deadlines and multiple demands. A five day (Monday through Friday) work week, with potential overtime, is required. All contractors must be U.S. citizens, or have lawful permanent resident alien status and must successfully complete a background security investigation.</p>

<DESC>This notice is made in accordance with FAR Part 5.203 and will account for the 15 day pre-solicitation issuance requirement. The anticipated release date for the solicitation is June 1, 2011. <br /><br />The Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), Office of Security Technology (ST) has a requirement for a qualified contractor to provide a robust, cradle-to-grave Supply Chain Management (SCM) service. ST envisions a holistic approach to supply chain, with a strong management infrastructure capable of integrating and managing the flow of products and information. The goal is multifold: to create a responsive, proactive and cost-effective supply chain capable of not only managing a catalog of more than five-thousand unique products and distributing them to over 147 domestic and 285 overseas DOS facilities with real-time visibility, tracking and accurate lead times; but to provide like services for any other items ordered in support of DOS critical needs. <br /><br />Due to the unique, sometimes dangerous and hostile locations of DOS facilities, ST must maintain the ability to apply cutting edge technology to new problems in information and personnel protection. The contractor will need to possess an expert knowledge of Technical Security Systems (TSS) in order to fulfill the technology development aspect of the supply chain. The objectives are for the SCM Contractor to:
<p>&bull;Ensure best value pricing of products and services;</p>
<p>&bull;Reduce the time to obtain products and services, ensuring predictable, consistent lead times;</p>
<p>&bull;Standardize staging of equipment for shipping and implementation;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide reliable, on schedule deliveries worldwide;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide customer's real-time visibility into the supply chain process;</p>
<p>&bull;Manage costs and obsolescence through equipment repair;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide technical assistance and life-cycle support to perimeter X-Ray, explosive detection equipment, and other specialized equipment;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide real-time order status, accurate delivery schedules, and delivery confirmation notices to the ordering activity and installation contractors, of any item ordered (not merely those noted in the aforementioned catalog);</p>
<p>&bull;Facilitate the customs process for in-country receipt of overseas shipments;</p>
<p>&bull;Identify and develop technology to improve technical security capability, minimize security vulnerabilities, and reduce costs;</p>
<p>&bull;Maintain the technical specification documents for TSS;</p>
<p>&bull;Test and evaluate identified commercial-off-the-shelf equipment or systems for approval or disapproval;</p>
<p>&bull;Identify and incorporate innovative, superior technology in DS-approved equipment and systems while staying abreast of new developments and technologies;</p>
<p>&bull;Conduct market research, product surveys, systems integration efforts, and product comparisons to ensure the best possible technology or solution is used;</p>
<p>&bull;If no commercial-off-the-shelf products are available, design and develop specialized technical security applications, equipment, and solutions as required with approval to support appropriate standards;</p>
<p>&bull;Develop, create and maintain documentation for customer requirements, technology needs assessments, concept of operations, system specifications, product test and evaluation, pilot project plans, equipment deployment, technical drawings, technical bulletins and new product bulletins;</p>
<p>&bull;Assist the DS Training Center to create and maintain training materials for new equipment;</p>
<p>&bull;Assist customers with troubleshooting and equipment deployment;</p>
<p>&bull;Research, evaluate, and present recommendations for new locking hardware;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide lock support and technical assistance, and</p>
<p>&bull;Maintain online document repositories that include equipment bulletins, deployment documentation, manufacturer's literature, and drawings.</p>
<p>This contract will be unique in that ST anticipates awarding three separate but critically related contracts to support the delivery and installation of TSS to domestic and overseas posts. Each Contractor shall be required to collaborate to create the most effective and efficient support organization for meeting ST goals. To ensure that product delivery is coordinated with installation, Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA) shall be required. ACAs shall be applicable for any portion of the contract that necessitates joint participation in the accomplishment of the Government's requirement. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is one (1) base year and four (4) one-year options. This requirement will be solicited using 100% full and open competition. The Government reserves the right to issue multi-type task orders for specific tasks approved by the Contracting Officer. Contractor performance will be measured in accordance with the metrics specified in each task order. The contract will be awarded utilizing the best value trade-off source selection methodology. This means that the offeror's plan of operation is more significant than cost. As technical merit of the Offeror's proposals become more equal, the evaluated cost or price may become the determining factor. The National American Individual Classification Standard (NAICS) code for procurement is 541614, Process, Physical Distribution and Logistics Consulting Services</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to possess a SECRET Facility Clearance at the time of proposal submission. The contractor must have the ability to obtain a TOP SECRET Facility Clearance.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, Massachusetts, intends to issue a solicitation for the San Diego International Airport Runway 9 MALSR System Refurbishment Project. The solicitation is being competed as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside and is intended for a single award.
<p><br />The Volpe Center is supporting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for this project. The FAA owns and maintains an approach lighting system (ALS) to Runway 9 at the San Diego International Airport. An ALS is a configuration of signal lights disposed symmetrically about the extended runway centerline, starting at the landing threshold and extending outward into the approach zone. This system provides pilots with visual information regarding runway alignment, height perception, roll guidance and horizon references. Specifically, the system is a Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System (MALS) with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights (RAIL), considered a MALSR in combination. The MALS consists of a threshold light bar and seven steady burning light bars spaced at 200-foot intervals along the extended runway centerline and extending out a distance of 1,400 feet from the Runway 9 threshold. The RAIL portion consists of five sequence flashers located on the extended runway centerline, the first being located after the last steady burning light station, with successive light stations located at 200-foot intervals out to approximately 2,400 feet from the runway threshold. All lights are aimed into the Runway 9 approach and away from the runway threshold.<br /><br />MALSR Station 15+00 and each successive light station after that are supported on top of an elevated timber platform. Four of the platforms (Stations 15+00, 17+00, 19+00, 21+00) are located in a boat channel (the former mouth of the San Diego River and referred to on some maps as Navy Lagoon) and the last two stations (Stations 23+00 and 24+85) are located on land across the lagoon on elevated platforms as well within Naval Training Center (NTC) Park, a recently-developed San Diego city park. Initially installed in 1982, the platforms at Stations 15+00, 17+00, 19+00, 21+00 and six of the eight supporting timber piles at Stations 17+00, 19+00, and 21+00 have deteriorated to a point where the structural and operational integrity of the MALSR is in question.<br /><br />The FAA plans to make the necessary repairs to the MALSR and bring the platforms into Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) compliance. The proposed action is strictly maintenance-related and does not affect the existing functionality of the airport. The purpose of the contract is for a Contractor to install new piles, platforms, OSHA-compliant ladder system, and MALSR Lighting System.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is for this acquisition is 237990 with a small business size standard of $33.5 million. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.204 Disclosure of the magnitude of construction projects, the estimated price of this procurement is within the following price range: (e) Between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

<DESC>The U.S. Chemical Safety Board intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to DNV (Det Norske Veritas) Software, Katy, TX for the following:
<p>A single seat license for two sites of DNV's PHAST (Process Hazard Analysis Software Tool) software based on 1-year license term with 4 option years.</p>
<p>This purchase order is being issued to DNV Software because it is required by the government to perform chemical incident analysis in connection with CSB investigations. The CSB uses the DNV Software dispersion modeling software to assess situations which present potential hazards and to quantify their severity. PHAST enables our investigators to examine the progress of a potential incident from the initial release to far-field dispersion including modelling of pool spreading and evaporation, and flammable and toxic effects. No other software is as widely used by companies which CSB is or has investigated. Moreover, no other software contains the same range of models for discharge and dispersion as well as flammable, explosive and toxic effects. DNV Software is the developer and only supplier of PHAST.</p>
<p>This purchase is being issued to DNV Software because there is no alternative since they are the only source who can provide the items being requested by the government. This request is considered to be sole source to DNV Software. All responsible sources may submit a bid proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency. Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc, in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability. Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. The North American Classification Code (NAIC) is 541990. This award shall be made using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All interested firms must respond to CSB-12-RFQ-0008 by 05:00 P.M. EST, June 15, 2012. Request for information should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Allen Smith at 202-261-7638 or via email at allen.smith@csb.gov. All proposals should be e-mailed to contracts@csb.gov.</p>

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) requirement for a requires an upgrade of an existing HiSeq 2000 system to HiSeq 2500 system with post-warranty service/maintenance options inclusive of all parts, labor and travel for the entire system.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking business sources, including total small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, 8(a) certified companies and other than small businesses. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The government is seeking capability statements from manufacturing businesses capable of meeting the performance requirements.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Facility Biotechnology Resources (FBR) within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) requires an upgrade of an existing HiSeq 2000 system to HiSeq 2500 system with post-warranty service/maintenance options inclusive of all parts, labor and travel for the entire system.</p>
<p>The Facility for Biotechnology Resources (FBR) provides next generation sequencing (NGS) services for scientists within CBER of the FDA. FBR currently has a HiSeq2000, serial number 7001029, next generation sequencer from Illumina. It is a high-throughput DNA sequencing system capable of generating ~600 gigabase sequencing information in one run. Its high efficiency is based on running one or two flow cells, each has 8 lanes for samples. However some researchers do not need 8 lanes in the flow cells for their work when only a few samples for analysis are needed. The upgrade of the HiSeq 2000 to a HiSeq 2500 will enable the instrument to run 2-lane flow cell at a time, thus significatnly reducing the cost of an experiment requiring only 1-2 lanes in a flow cell. The upgraded instrument will allow the reagent flow appropriately for both 2-lane and 8-lane flow cells and the ability to alternate between the two run times as needed A validation run of the upgrade system shall be completed prior to acceptance.<br /><br />Post-Warranty Service Agreement</p>
<p>The service agreement shall include, at a minimum, the following:<br />&bull; Minimum of one (1) Preventative Maintenance visit per contract year;<br />&bull; Unlimited on-site preventative maintenance, services, and repairs;<br />&bull; Unlimited Priority Telephone and Email Support;<br />&bull; Peak performance maintenance kits;<br />&bull; Software updates;<br />&bull; Preventative maintenance, services, and repairs performed by an OEM trained and certified technician;<br />&bull; Preventative maintenance, services, and repairs include all labor, travel, and new OEM factory-certified replacement parts, components, subassemblies, etc. (except consumables);<br />&bull; Phone support available from 8am to 5pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday;<br />&bull; Priority scheduling for requests for service within 24 hrs; and</p>

<DESC>This is a follow on award for 15 Goes Transmitters capable of interfacing with the E-Sampler and E-Bam smoke monitors.&nbsp;&nbsp; The award was made to FTS Technology, 1065 Henry Eng Place, Victoria, BC&nbsp; V9B 6B2 for $87,500.00.&nbsp; Duns No. 242470466<br /><br />These transmitters are made by FTS Technologies, 1065 Henry Eng. Place, Victoria, BC and have proprietary protocol (interface) between the monitors.
<p>The monitors give data to the transmitters, which in turn transmit the data to the GOES Satellites. The Forest Service can retrieve the data from the satellites at no cost in order to monitor smoke output around the country.</p>
<p>The Forest Service has a national cache pilot program with 15 of the Met One E-Sampler and E-Bam smoke monitors that will be used with the FTS GOES transmitters. In order to keep the data reliable it is necessary to use the same transmission configuration which would entail purchasing the same transmitters. <br /><br />I researched on the Internet and contacted several companies and was told that the interface between the Met One monitors and transmitter is proprietary to FTS Technologies.</p>
<p>It is my opinion that FTS Technologies is a responsible firm and the Goes transmitters are being sold at a reasonable and fair price.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration if there were to be another transmitter, it would entail different maintenance, training and spare parts requirements that would increase the cost of the smoke monitor program.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p><br />1.0 DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>1.1 The Nonappropriated Funds Instrumentality (NAFI) Office, Commander Navy Installations Command (CNIC) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) under NAICS code 541512 in support of the Navy General Library Program (NGLP), and is seeking information on how an interested contractor could provide an all-inclusive, expandable, and non-web-based eBook lending library.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is for planning and informational purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the NAFI to acquire any products or services.

<p>2.0 STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>2.1 Background:</p>
<p>Recent changes in the publishing industry and price cuts for e-reading devices have resulted in a large segment of the population being served with e-Reader devices. These devices have made the circulation of eBooks an everyday option for library customers on shore with end users able to access an ever growing number of eBooks via direct purchase on personally owned devices. To keep pace with these publishing trends many libraries on shore also lend eReader devices to customers, and provide access to web-based digital libraries. eBooks in the current publishing and library marketplaces is dependent on customers having reliable internet access and sufficient bandwidth for file transfer. While underway, sailors on surface going vessels DO NOT have access to sufficient bandwidth continuously, and sailors deployed on submarines have NO access to recreational internet connections. Submariners also have a severely limited Surface Library Multimedia Resource Center (LMRC) collection because of storage restrictions. LMRCs that are able to store a physical library collection could be greatly expanded to provide access to current publications. All sailors, surface and submarine, also have restrictions on personal gear storage, and may not be able to pack and store every electronic device they wish to use while underway.</p>
<p>Library services ashore and aboard ships are a mission essential component of the U.S. Navy's Morale Welfare and Recreation services, and the Navy General Library Program (NGLP) has provided on shore customers with access to a web-based digital lending library since 2005.</p>
<p>2.2 Purpose:</p>
<p>This RFI is for an all-inclusive and expandable non-web-based eBook lending library that would bring a similar level of service to shipboard LMRC customers.

<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for Small Business concerns, as identified in FAR Part 19.102, for market research purposes only, and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. The General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Special Programs Division, is seeking possible sources to provide design-build services under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. <br /><br />The small business size standard associated with NAICS 236220 is $33.5 Million (effective August 22, 2008), which means that a company, including its affiliates, would be considered a "small business" if their average annual gross receipts does not exceed $33.5 Million for the past three years. If a company has not been in business for three years, the average weekly revenue for the number of weeks the company has been in business is multiplied by 52 to determine the average annual receipts.</p>
<p>Place of Performance: Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Restriction: Contractor must either be located in Puerto Rico or demonstrate the ability to perform design and construction services in Puerto Rico at a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to seek possible small business contractors capable of providing design and construction services to support the Department of Homeland Security, U.S Customs and Border Protection, Air and Marine Facilities, in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.<br /><br />The work will consist of services to include, but not be limited to, the design and construction of a 22,792 s.f. maintenance hangar, a 9,597 s.f. administrative support facility, and an open hangar area with fifteen (15) parking spaces.

The new construction area is located in close proximity to a hangar (#574) and will partially replace the existing parking lot. The hangar shall be designed to accommodate six (6) aircraft. The project is located in an active airport and will require the coordination and phasing of all work so as not to disturb existing operations. The contractor will be required to work with the U.S. Government and the local Puerto Rican government to ensure compliance with all applicable requirements. The new facility will include security measures; as such, previous experience with Federal security standards is desired.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Program has a requirement to embrace and communicate the message of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI).  The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) proposes to create a revised National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) consisting of 32 HUCs in the L'Anguille area of Arkansas. With current high resolution digital ortho aerial photography as well as LiDAR data, ADEQ will update the existing medium and high resolution NHD data for the Bayou Meto area from 1:100,000 and 1:24,000 scale to 1:4,800 scale for the entire area. This will update water sources such as streams, lakes, rivers, ponds and the flow of the water. This update will assist in the analysis of water resources for flow, flood inundation, impacts of a spill, etc.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the government considers the item specified as a sole source from The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) and proposes to negotiate with that entity on that basis.

<DESC>The Program Manager for Training Systems (PM TRASYS) intends to award a sole source contract in the amount of approximately $200K to build seven (7) C15 engine/transmission trainers, identical to those already supplied under a previous contract to Camp Johnson, aboard USMC Base Camp LeJeune.

Because the Government has already fielded substantial numbers of identical C15 engine/transmission trainers and only requires seven (7) additional units, any system provided at this point in time must be the same as those already fielded in form fit and function with fully interchangeable sub-assemblies to reduce the burden of configuration management on the Government, allow for interchangeability of sub-components to maximum extent possible, and to ensure cohesive training.

The C15 engine/transmission trainer is a critical component in the teaching of maintenance and troubleshooting skills necessary to maintain engine and transmission systems on heavy duty military vehicles.
  It is the intent of the Government to have the requisite engines and transmissions supplied to the vendor as Government furnished equipment (GFE) for installation/modification into an acceptable training system.  These trainers will then be supplied to the school house at Camp Johnson in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.

In order to train Marines on new devices, a training system has been developed to replicate the engine and transmission loads being placed on the components outside the vehicle frame.  This device allows the full troubleshooting of diagnostic codes via the Vehicle Automotive Diagnostic System (VADS) by sending the codes to the computer to allow the full evaluation of the faults.

The contractor will be responsible for providing all labor, materials, consumables, equipment, tools, and test equipment necessary to facilitate the integration of the GFE equipment into a complete training solution.

All questions, concerns, and information concerning this synopsis should be addressed to Ms.
 Sandi Brubaker at sandi.brubaker@usmc.mil or mailed to Ms. Sandi Brubaker at the contracting office listed below.

<DESC>United States Army Project Manager Electronic Warfare (PM EW) requests industry comments on the clarity, format, and technical detail of the Electronic Warfare Planning & Management Tool (EWPMT) "DRAFT Performance Based Specification (PBS)." This specification covers the EWPMT for the Integrated Electronic Warfare System (IEWS).  IEWS will provide commanders from Corps to Company focusing on the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) with an organic EW capability that dramatically improves a land force's ability to seize, retain, and exploit an advantage within the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) in order to execute decisive operations successfully.<br><br>EWPMT is a software program giving EWOs a mission planning capability to plan, coordinate, manage, and de-conflict unit EW activities.  It will provide battle management for distributed, networked EW capability, aligned with fires and synchronize air and ground electromagnetic spectrum operations across the G2/3/6.  EWPMT capabilities include producing EW orders and estimates, plan and appropriately employ EW assets, conduct effective EW targeting using lethal and non-lethal fires support; enhance development of the Electronic Order of Battle; and conduct EW battle damage assessment.  EMPMT will provide a risk assessment and Course of Action (COA) development for EW missions with all software applications and tools that will be instantiated as a set of services to be run within the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) and one or more presentation-layer widgets to be run on a thin client laptop. <br>	 <br>PM EW requests all comments/questions be submitted not later than 22 June 2012 using the provided, standard Comment Resolution Format (CRM).  All comments will be reviewed by the Government PBS team whose goal is to provide as much clarity and detail within the PBS to support a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Note: This request is for planning purposes only in accordance with FAR 15.201 and does not constitute a RFP.  Additionally, this request should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to eventually issue an RFP.  <br><br>CRM responses shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer at the following email address: Patrick.Morse1@us.army.mil.<br><br>CRM responses and any technical questions shall also be addressed to Mr. Steve Abbott, Lead Engineer PM EW, at the following email address: steve.abbott@us.army.mil.<br>

This acquisition is to provide Table Trans software licenses and maintenance support currently being used for the FDA's Adverse Event Data from AERS.
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires TableTrans software which is a data mapping tool that can help with converting data to a more usable format. Modifying data to a usable format has been a major initiative at the FDA. Much of the data submitted to FDA requires reformatting to be used in analytic tools. TableTrans is used to prepare the Adverse Event Data from AERS for use in Empirical Signal, a data mining tool. This tool can also be used to modify pre-clinical and clinical trial data.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the annual maintenance is one year. This requirement is currently being provided by PPD Development, LP and there are no resellers or 3rd parties that can provide these licenses. There are no other sources that can provide maintenance for this software.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide additional licenses and software support for the FDA. The software must support data transformations as a sequence of basic steps. Specifically, the software should posses the following salient characteristics:</p>
<p>&bull; Specify, execute and automatically document complex data transformations <br />&bull; Specify and extract transformed data interactively or in batch mode to files or databases <br />&bull; Provides a wide range of built-in transformation operators and database functions to minimize programming<br />&bull; Visual Programming <br />o Simplify data management and retrieval tasks through visual programming. <br />o Transform data visually, step-by-step <br />o Include visual transformations diagrams in order to facilitate explanation and modification<br />&bull; Selection from many data transformation operators<br />&bull; Provide SQL functionality without programming<br />&bull; Automatic documentation<br />&bull; 21 CFR compliant<br />Additionally, the software vendor shall provide support, including installation support, updates and technical support during regular business hours.

<DESC>QIAGEN Inc. Annual Service Agreement for QIAGEN Automated System #BioRobot 3000 and #BioRobot 8000

<DESC>Documentation Type: Special Notice
<p>Posted Date: June 8, 2012</p>
<p>Classification Code: B--Special Studies and Analyses - Not R&amp;D</p>
<p>Subject: Emissions Inventory Support</p>
<p><br />Description<br />The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to enter into negotiations with TranSystem Corporation for a four-month extension to existing contract, EP-D-07-097, on a sole source basis, IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). The current contract was awarded on a small business set-aside competition basis and is to expire 06/30/2012. A follow-on competitive procurement is in process; however, it will not be awarded before EP-D-07-097 expires. This contract is for services in support of The Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (0AQPS) to provide support for EPA's emission inventory application, modification, and development responsibilities. These activities will provide effective coverage of emission inventories for the pollutants currently regulated or contemplated for regulation, i.e., volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), ammonia, sulfur dioxide (SO2), Lead (Pb), global warming gases and hazardous air pollutants.</p>
<p>The OAQPS relies on this contract for support for (1) preparation, analysis, and review of emission inventories; (2) development of data in support of emissions processing tools; (3) emision factor program support; (4) emissions monitoring program support; and, (5) technology transfer activities. Any interruption in this support poses a significant risk of missing statutory and court-ordered deadlines. Many of these deadlines will occur within the next 12 months, which requires analytical support well in advance of those deadlines. Specifically, National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), and review of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) are some of the regulatory efforts with approaching deadlines.</p>
<p>The Agency has a substantial investment in the unique experience and knowledge that TranSystems Corporation developed while providing emissions inventory support for OAQPS. Transystems Corporation has been providing support for these programs since Contract EP-D-07-097 was awarded in 2007. They are uniquely qualified to provide the additional four-month effort because timing is critical and no other contractor could acquire the knowledge and expertise of the EPA's emission inventory application, modification, and development requirement in the time frame that is required. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another contractor to provide the service that would meet this requirement, and the costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue an award for contract extension under other than full and open competition and should not be considered a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement not later than June 22, 2012 at 12:01 p.m. EST. Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is viable. If no acceptable timely responses are received, the contract with TranSystems Corporation will be extended by a four-month period. A determination by the Government not to compete this contract extension, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable. E-mail your interest to newsome.otelia@epa.gov. Award is anticipated on or about June 29, 2012.</p>

<DESC>Program Title:  Army Mobile Instrumented Training System (AMITS)<br><br>Introduction:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (PM CTIS) intends to procure an integrated live Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS) training capability with a focus on reduced operational, support, and sustainment costs and implementing a communications architecture that supports future TESS capabilities. <br><br>HITS is the Army program of record and AMITS will be the contract name providing the HITS capability.<br><br>Acquisition Strategy Planning Information (Draft):<br><br>Contract Vehicle:  TBD <br>Contract Type: TBD<br><br>Approximate Funding: $143M, FY13-FY18<br> 	Base award Base award ~ $7M FY13 (1st  Range 8-9 Months ARO)<br> 	FY14  ~ $29M (4 Ranges) <br> 	FY15  ~ $30M (4 Ranges) <br> 	FY16  ~ $30M (4 Ranges)<br> 	FY17  ~ $31M (4 Ranges) <br> 	FY18  ~ $16M (2 Ranges)<br><br>Acquisition Time Estimates: <br> 	Sources Sought Release July 2012, followed up with Industry day<br> 	RFP Release September 2012 <br> 	Contract Award April 2013<br><br><br>Requirement: PM TRADE has a requirement to field a HITS training capability to 21 OCONUS and OCONUS sites over a 5 year period.  Most sites are CONUS but include Hawaii, Alaska, Germany, and Korea.  Additional FMS and support (customer funded) requirements may increase quantity buys.<br><br>Army Mobile Instrumented Training Systems (AMITS) will be fielded at rate of one per quarter beginning in 4Q13 and ending in 4Q18. The AMITS, with existing TESS and future OneTESS, will provide the end-to-end Home Station Training Capability in a mobile configuration. AMITS consists of a mobile instrumentation control center with AAR capability, mobile tower trailers, and a bi directional communications network between the vehicles and soldiers equipped with TESS, and has the capability for Over-The-Air remote configuration management updates to OneTESS/A-TESS type systems.  <br><br>A key objective of the AMITS program will be to reduce the operational support and sustainment costs of a HITS capability.  The integrated mobile shelter will host 4 operators, all network communications equipment, a powered telescoping antenna tower, rack servers, displays, permanent workstation desk/storage area, limited AAR capability, diesel generator, fuel, interior and exterior lighting, HVAC system for environmental extremes, and sound/thermal insulation.  The multi axle commercial shelter and mobile tower trailers will be capable of being towed by a HMMWV or F-250 type truck over semi-improved roads.  The 4 operators will be responsible for setting up, operating, maintaining, and taking down the entire AMITS.<br><br>Additionally, OneTESS indirect fire pairings will rely on AMITS communications to complete player Real Time casualty Assessment (RTCA) pairings and not the MILES laser.  This will require very low latency rates to support RTCA within the time of flight of the indirect fire munitions (mortars, artillery, MK-29, M203/320).   The communications architecture must be capable of supporting up to 2000 live entities (approximately 30% vehicles and 70% dismounts).  Intent is to acquire approximately 1165 player unit radios per fielding site. <br><br>Consolidated configuration management intent is to have it performed at a single location (likely Orlando) and pushed to each of the sites and OneTESS devices to reduce support and sustainment costs and improve configuration management.  <br><br>Follow-on Industry Meetings:  The government intends to release a draft set of technical documents and draft acquisition strategy information under a Sources Sought release in mid to late July.  Approximately 2 weeks later the government will host an Industry Day with one-on-one sessions.  <br><br>Business Collaboration Site on LT2 Portal: An AMITS business collaboration site has been established on the www.lt2portal.org site to help facilitate prime contractor and subcontractor product and capability exposure. New users must register and will be given access to the portal.  Navigate to the collaboration page and click the AMITS link to access the role/product/POC spread sheet.<br><br>RFI: As a part of Market Research, the project team requests interested Prime contractors provide a 1-5 page product summary of existing fielded capabilities currently in use in a military/government operational/training environment supporting the same or similar requirements.  Responses must include evidence of being capable of meeting an 8 month after contract award delivery schedule with no development funding provided.  Please clearly indicate if you are a large or small business.  If a small business, identify other appropriate information for set-aside purposes (8(a), woman-owned, etc).  Additionally, if you are a STOC II contractor in PEO STRI's STOC II IDIQ contracts, please indicate that.<br><br>Prime contractors are encouraged to schedule an initial face to face meeting with Mr. Rob Wolf between 19 June and 3 July to facilitate government market research and provide their RFI response via email to rob.wolf1@us.army.mil.  Written responses should be submitted at least one fill business day prior to the scheduled face-to face. If you are not scheduling an initial meeting please provide your response NLT 28 June.<br><br>POCs:  Technical: Mr. Rob Wolf, 407 384 5233 rob.wolf1@us.army.mil,  Contracts:  Mr. Terry Gotter, 407 380 4338 terry.gotter@us.army.mil <br>

This new solicitation number FCO-00-CORP-0000C, Refresh #15 will replace solicitation number FCO-00-CORP-0000C, Refresh #14, posted on April 4, 2012 and includes updated clauses and provisions.

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 9 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Offerors are responsible for payment to Open Ratings, Inc. for past performance evaluation prior to submission of an offer.

The Consolidated Schedule program is an acquisition vehicle that streamlines the acquisition process.  Offers may be submitted for evaluation to obtain a single contract for multiple schedule business lines that fall within the scope of participating schedules.  Existing schedule contractors may migrate to obtain a single contract as an alternative to holding multiple (2 or more) schedule contracts.  Offers and migration requests will only be evaluated under this schedule program when the offer/migration proposes 2 or more schedule business lines.  See Part I, Section entitled Goods & Services of the solicitation for detailed information on participating schedules.
This solicitation is open continuously with no closing date. The resultant contracts are awarded as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity; Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment. Contract periods commence on the Date of Award through a 5-year base period with three 5-year option periods. The resultant contracts provide a streamlined acquisition approach to fulfilling requirements that fall within the scope of more than one schedule for acquiring a total solution. Agency ordering procedures for services and further information on the GSA Multiple Award Schedules program may be found at www.gsa.gov/schedules. 
  
GSA is only issuing this solicitation/request for proposal through the FedBizOpps internet site, GSA will not provide paper copies of this solicitation. Interested parties may access the solicitation at Internet address http://www.FedBizOpps.gov. This site contains information describing the Federal Business Opportunities and how to register to receive automatic notices of acquisitions.

<DESC>To be the Governments leader in acquisition services, GSA sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs. With the recent award of 15 BPAs of Office Supplies in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) and to best allocate government resources, GSA temporarily postponed Schedule 75 to new Multiple Awards Schedules (MAS) offers for 24 months, effective October 1, 2010. At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program. 

*This solicitation continues to be postponed to new offers.

GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program. Since holding a schedule contract is a very expensive proposition for the schedule holder and GSA, we are reallocating our resources to better serve our customer base. Current Schedule 75 contract holders with available options that are successfully performing will continue to be exercised. Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored. 

Questions regarding postponement:

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is a sole source acquisition notice for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has a requirement for customer relationship assessments through the use and interpretation of customer surveys for the Launch Services Program (LSP). This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Request for Quotation to Harlan Brown & Company, Inc., Sinking Spring, PA for the LSP 2012 Customer Survey requirements listed in the attached Statement of Work. Harlan Brown & Company, Inc. provided this same assessment in 2010.  Harlan Brown & Company, Inc.  has unique mission perspective and knowledge gained of NASAs culture, history, and customer organizational relationships as a result of compiling the 2010 assessment.  The 2012 assessment must utilize the results of the 2010 to compare with the results of the 2012 assessment.  The 2012 assessment must allow LSP to better understand its customer needs, concerns, and how to tailor the mission support it provides to meet mission milestones. Harlan Brown & Company, Inc.  will be requested to provide a refresher and continuance to the assessment presentation provided to the LSP management team throughout the performance period. With respect to the current assessment under consideration at this time, Harlan Brown & Company, Inc.,  participated in the 2010 evaluation and has expertise in the design needs of the 2012 survey/assessment instruments.  Based on Harlan Brown & Company, Inc.s unique technical expertise and prior familiarity and work experience on the project, competition is impractical. It is in the best interest of the Government to procure customer relationship assessments from Harlan Brown & Company. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable. <br />0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank." <br />WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number TO BE DETERMINED<br />Delivery Order TO BE DETERMINED<br />Cage Code/Ext TO BE DETERMINED<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date TO BE DETERMINED<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>MSFSC INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING CHARGES<br />At the time of invoice, a shipping receipt must be provided to substantiate shipping or freight charges greater than $25.00.</p>
<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL.

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Reserved.<br />(g) Contract award. The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in this solicitation and award to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the Government. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint (see "Evaluation" below).<br />(h) Reserved.<br />(i) Reserved.<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun &amp; Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An vendor within the United States may contact Dun &amp; Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at: http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform.<br />Any vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless the vendor is exempted in accordance FAR 4.1102, by submission of an quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 12.602(a) and FAR 13.106-2, the following is provided:<br />EVALUATION<br />(a) The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this Request for Quotation (RFQ) to the vendor whose quotation conforms to the solicitation and is considered most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement based on the Statement of Work (See Attachment 1)<br />(ii) price<br />Basis for award: The award will be made to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the government. As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive, whose quotation reflects a complete understanding of the requirement, and represents the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price. The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The technical area will be evaluated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. Only those quotations determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated on price. If the quotation received is determined to be unacceptable, the vendor will be excluded from competition and will not be considered for award.<br />(b) Reserved.<br />(c) A purchase order, mailed or otherwise furnished to the vendor shall result in a binding contract upon receipt of written acknowlegement by the vendor or commencement of performance.<br />________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: In accordance with FAR 13.004, the following information regarding quotations is provided:<br />Legal Effect of Quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 12.602(a) and FAR 13.106-2, the following is provided:<br />EVALUATION<br />(a) The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this Request for Quotation (RFQ) to the vendor whose quotation conforms to the solicitation and is considered most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement based on the Statement of Work (See Attachment 1)<br />(ii) price<br />Basis for award: The award will be made to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the government. As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive, whose quotation reflects a complete understanding of the requirement, and represents the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price. The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The technical area will be evaluated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. Only those quotations determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated on price. If the quotation received is determined to be unacceptable, the vendor will be excluded from competition and will not be considered for award.<br />(b) Reserved.<br />(c) A purchase order, mailed or otherwise furnished to the vendor shall result in a binding contract upon receipt of written acknowlegement by the vendor or commencement of performance.<br />________________________________________________________________________<br />NOTE: In accordance with FAR 13.004, the following information regarding quotations is provided:<br />Legal Effect of Quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>(i) List of attachments for this combined synopsis/solicitation:</p>

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is used.</p>
<p>The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1, Price. For award purposes, the offeror will be evaluated on the TOTAL PRICE of all CLINS as contained in the schedule. Apparent calculation errors found in an offer may be corrected by the Government. Only US Dollar or Euro currency offers will be accepted in accordance with (IAW) provision 5352.225-9004, Submission of Offers in Other Than United States Currency. All offers that are received in Euro currency will be converted to US Dollars by using the established Foreign Currency Fluctuation Defense (FCFD) budget rate, which is currently 0.7491 Euro per US Dollar.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2, Past Performance. The purpose of past performance evaluation is to assess the offeror's ability to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past work records. Past performance will be evaluated for recency, relevancy, and quality of services rendered. Evaluation of past performance will be a critical assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The Government reserves the right to use past performance information obtained from other sources (questionnaires, CPARS data, customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, and any other sources) that may have useful and/or relevant information. One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror's past performance has been evaluated:</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUTION RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Acceptable Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports an unacceptable rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>(4) Award Process: The Government will make an award to the lowest price offeror with an Acceptable past performance rating. The Government will evaluate all submissions for price. The lowest price offer will then be evaluated for past performance. If the lowest priced offeror's past performance is determined to be "Acceptable", the evaluation process will stop and award will be made to that offeror. If the lowest priced offeror's past performance is determined to be "Unacceptable", the Government will evaluate the past performance of the next lowest offeror. This process will continue, as needed, until an offeror is rated "Acceptable" for past performance. This offeror will receive the award. The Government intends to make one award to the offeror meeting the above criteria without discussions, but reserves the right to open discussions at any time in the evaluation process. <br />(End of provision)<br /><br />(x) Include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Alt I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with your offer or complete paragraph (b)(2) of 52.212-3 Alt 1, if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov .

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is used.</p>
<p>The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1, Price. : Quotation pricing for the Base Year and Option Year 1 will be evaluated together as one proposal and will also be evaluated for fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3, Award and Documentation.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2, Past Experience. Past experience will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement for specific requirements. Offerors must meet requirements listed in Para 4 and provide all necessary documented proof. Offerors who meet the requirements will be given a pass rating.</p>
<p>One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past experience factor when an offeror's past experience has been evaluated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PAST EXPERIENCE EVALUTION RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Pass Based on the offeror's past experience record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Fail Based on the offeror's past experience record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past experience or for whom information on past experience is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past experience rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past experience (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past experience. In the context of pass/fail, "unknown" shall be considered "pass."</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past experience. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past experience information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past experience is defined as past experience information that supports a fail rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 3, Technical. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p>(4) Award Process: The Government will award one contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offer, whose quote conforms to this RFQ and the Performance Work Statement (PWS), will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The award will be made to the low offer, whose quotation represents the best value in terms of price and past experience when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer. For specific past experience requirements refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p>Quotation pricing will be accepted in either US Dollars or Euro. The FCFD rate that will be used for evaluation purposes is $1.00 = &euro; 0.7491.</p>

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is used.</p>
<p>The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1, Price. : Quotation pricing for the Base Year and Option Year 1 will be evaluated together as one proposal and will also be evaluated for fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3, Award and Documentation.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2, Past Experience. Past experience will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement for specific requirements. Offerors must meet requirements listed in Para 4 and provide all necessary documented proof. Offerors who meet the requirements will be given a pass rating.</p>
<p>One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror's past performance has been evaluated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PAST EXPERIENCE EVALUTION RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Pass Based on the offeror's past expericne record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Fail Based on the offeror's past experience record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past experience or for whom information on past experience is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past experience rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past experience (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past experience. In the context of pass/fail, "unknown" shall be considered "pass."</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past experience. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past experience information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past experience is defined as past experience information that supports a fail rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 3, Technical. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p><br />(4) Award Process: The Government will award one contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offer, whose quote conforms to this RFQ and the Performance Work Statement (PWS), will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The award will be made to the low offer, whose quotation represents the best value in terms of price and past experience when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer. For specific past experience requirements refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p>Quotation pricing will be accepted in either US Dollars or Euro. The FCFD rate that will be used for evaluation purposes is $1.00 = &euro; 0.7491.</p>

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is used.</p>
<p>The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1, Price. : Quotation pricing for the Base Year and Option Year 1 will be evaluated together as one proposal and will also be evaluated for fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3, Award and Documentation.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2, Past Experience. Past experience will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement for specific requirements. Offerors must meet requirements listed in Para 4 and provide all necessary documented proof. Offerors who meet the requirements will be given a pass rating.</p>
<p>One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror's past performance has been evaluated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PAST EXPERIENCE EVALUTION RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Pass Based on the offeror's past expericne record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Fail Based on the offeror's past experience record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past experience or for whom information on past experience is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past experience rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past experience (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past experience. In the context of pass/fail, "unknown" shall be considered "pass."</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past experience. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past experience information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past experience is defined as past experience information that supports a fail rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 3, Technical. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p><br />(4) Award Process: The Government will award one contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offer, whose quote conforms to this RFQ and the Performance Work Statement (PWS), will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The award will be made to the low offer, whose quotation represents the best value in terms of price and past experience when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer. For specific past experience requirements refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p>Quotation pricing will be accepted in either US Dollars or Euro. The FCFD rate that will be used for evaluation purposes is $1.00 = &euro; 0.7491.</p>

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is used.</p>
<p>The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1, Price. : Quotation pricing for the Base Year and Option Year 1 will be evaluated together as one proposal and will also be evaluated for fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3, Award and Documentation.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2, Past Experience. Past experience will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement for specific requirements. Offerors must meet requirements listed in Para 4 and provide all necessary documented proof. Offerors who meet the requirements will be given a pass rating.</p>
<p>One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror's past performance has been evaluated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PAST EXPERIENCE EVALUTION RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Pass Based on the offeror's past expericne record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Fail Based on the offeror's past experience record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past experience or for whom information on past experience is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past experience rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past experience (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past experience. In the context of pass/fail, "unknown" shall be considered "pass."</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past experience. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past experience information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past experience is defined as past experience information that supports a fail rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 3, Technical. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p><br />(4) Award Process: The Government will award one contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offer, whose quote conforms to this RFQ and the Performance Work Statement (PWS), will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The award will be made to the low offer, whose quotation represents the best value in terms of price and past experience when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer. For specific past experience requirements refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p>Quotation pricing will be accepted in either US Dollars or Euro. The FCFD rate that will be used for evaluation purposes is $1.00 = &euro; 0.7491.</p>

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is used.</p>
<p>The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1, Price. : Quotation pricing for the Base Year and Option Year 1 will be evaluated together as one proposal and will also be evaluated for fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3, Award and Documentation.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2, Past Experience. Past experience will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement for specific requirements. Offerors must meet requirements listed in Para 4 and provide all necessary documented proof. Offerors who meet the requirements will be given a pass rating.</p>
<p>One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror's past performance has been evaluated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PAST EXPERIENCE EVALUTION RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Pass Based on the offeror's past expericne record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Fail Based on the offeror's past experience record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past experience or for whom information on past experience is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past experience rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past experience (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past experience. In the context of pass/fail, "unknown" shall be considered "pass."</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past experience. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past experience information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past experience is defined as past experience information that supports a fail rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 3, Technical. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p><br />(4) Award Process: The Government will award one contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offer, whose quote conforms to this RFQ and the Performance Work Statement (PWS), will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The award will be made to the low offer, whose quotation represents the best value in terms of price and past experience when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer. For specific past experience requirements refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p>Quotation pricing will be accepted in either US Dollars or Euro. The FCFD rate that will be used for evaluation purposes is $1.00 = &euro; 0.7491.</p>

(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items, is used.  

The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:  

(1)  Factor 1, Price.  :  Quotation pricing for the Base Year and Option Year 1 will be evaluated together as one proposal and will also be evaluated for fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3, Award and Documentation.

(2)  Factor 2, Past Experience.  Past experience will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement for specific requirements.  Offerors must meet requirements listed in Para 4 and provide all necessary documented proof.  Offerors who meet the requirements will be given a pass rating.

One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror’s past performance has been evaluated:  




PAST EXPERIENCE EVALUTION RATINGS
RATING	DESCRIPTION

Pass	Based on the offeror’s past expericne record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror’s performance record is unknown. (See note below.)
Fail	Based on the offeror’s past experience record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.  

Note:  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past experience or for whom information on past experience is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past experience rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past experience (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)).  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past experience.  In the context of pass/fail, “unknown” shall be considered “pass.”

Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past experience. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past experience information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse past experience is defined as past experience information that supports a fail rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.

(3)  Factor 3, Technical.  The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition.  After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award.  If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.  


(4) Award Process:  The Government will award one contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offer, whose quote conforms to this RFQ and the Performance Work Statement (PWS), will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The award will be made to the low offer, whose quotation represents the best value in terms of price and past experience when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer. For specific past experience requirements refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition.  After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award.  If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.  

Quotation pricing will be accepted in either US Dollars or Euro. The FCFD rate that will be used for evaluation purposes is $1.00 = € 0.7491.

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is used.</p>
<p>The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1, Price. : Quotation pricing for the Base Year and Option Year 1 will be evaluated together as one proposal and will also be evaluated for fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3, Award and Documentation.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2, Past Experience. Past experience will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement for specific requirements. Offerors must meet requirements listed in Para 4 and provide all necessary documented proof. Offerors who meet the requirements will be given a pass rating.</p>
<p>One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror's past performance has been evaluated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PAST EXPERIENCE EVALUTION RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Pass Based on the offeror's past expericne record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Fail Based on the offeror's past experience record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past experience or for whom information on past experience is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past experience rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past experience (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past experience. In the context of pass/fail, "unknown" shall be considered "pass."</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past experience. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past experience information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past experience is defined as past experience information that supports a fail rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 3, Technical. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p><br />(4) Award Process: The Government will award one contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offer, whose quote conforms to this RFQ and the Performance Work Statement (PWS), will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The award will be made to the low offer, whose quotation represents the best value in terms of price and past experience when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer. For specific past experience requirements refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p>Quotation pricing will be accepted in either US Dollars or Euro. The FCFD rate that will be used for evaluation purposes is $1.00 = &euro; 0.7491.</p>

(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items, is used.  

The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:  

(1)  Factor 1, Price.  :  Quotation pricing for the Base Year and Option Year 1 will be evaluated together as one proposal and will also be evaluated for fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3, Award and Documentation.

(2)  Factor 2, Past Experience.  Past experience will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement for specific requirements.  Offerors must meet requirements listed in Para 4 and provide all necessary documented proof.  Offerors who meet the requirements will be given a pass rating.

One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror’s past performance has been evaluated:  




PAST EXPERIENCE EVALUTION RATINGS
RATING	DESCRIPTION

Pass	Based on the offeror’s past expericne record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror’s performance record is unknown. (See note below.)
Fail	Based on the offeror’s past experience record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.  

Note:  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past experience or for whom information on past experience is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past experience rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past experience (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)).  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past experience.  In the context of pass/fail, “unknown” shall be considered “pass.”

Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past experience. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past experience information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse past experience is defined as past experience information that supports a fail rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.

(3)  Factor 3, Technical.  The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition.  After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award.  If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.  


(4) Award Process:  The Government will award one contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offer, whose quote conforms to this RFQ and the Performance Work Statement (PWS), will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The award will be made to the low offer, whose quotation represents the best value in terms of price and past experience when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer. For specific past experience requirements refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition.  After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award.  If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.  

Quotation pricing will be accepted in either US Dollars or Euro. The FCFD rate that will be used for evaluation purposes is $1.00 = € 0.7491.

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is used.</p>
<p>The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1, Price. : Quotation pricing for the Base Year and Option Year 1 will be evaluated together as one proposal and will also be evaluated for fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3, Award and Documentation.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2, Past Experience. Past experience will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement for specific requirements. Offerors must meet requirements listed in Para 4 and provide all necessary documented proof. Offerors who meet the requirements will be given a pass rating.</p>
<p>One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror's past performance has been evaluated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PAST EXPERIENCE EVALUTION RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Pass Based on the offeror's past expericne record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Fail Based on the offeror's past experience record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past experience or for whom information on past experience is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past experience rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past experience (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past experience. In the context of pass/fail, "unknown" shall be considered "pass."</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past experience. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past experience information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past experience is defined as past experience information that supports a fail rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 3, Technical. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p><br />(4) Award Process: The Government will award one contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offer, whose quote conforms to this RFQ and the Performance Work Statement (PWS), will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The award will be made to the low offer, whose quotation represents the best value in terms of price and past experience when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer. For specific past experience requirements refer to Attachment 1 PWS Para. 4, Qualifications and Experience Requirement. The low offeror with a pass rating on past experience will be contacted to schedule an audition. After successfully meeting the criteria in the PWS Para 4, the offeror will be selected for award. If the offeror does not demonstrate the criteria successfully, the next low offeror with a pass rating will be contacted and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p>Quotation pricing will be accepted in either US Dollars or Euro. The FCFD rate that will be used for evaluation purposes is $1.00 = &euro; 0.7491.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

Records shall be made available upon request for inspection, and shall be forwarded to the PAR. Records rejected by the PAR due to improper preparation shall be corrected and returned by the Contractor at no additional cost to the Government.</p>
<p>14. HERBICIDE OPERATIONS</p>
<p>14.1. SCOPE. Undesirable weeds, shrubs, selected hardwood trees and other herbaceous<br />vegetation shall be controlled by broadcasting a mixture of Arsenal or Chopper and Accord (no substitutes) over the 156 acres to be treated as designated by the attached map. Application shall be accomplished during the period June 1- October 31, 2012, although application by September 1 is preferred for best timing for a site preparation burn conducted by Joint Base Charleston personnel. The Contractor is required to submit the Labels of any Pesticides he intends to use for approval or may use products from a DoD approved list provided by AMC Command Entomologist. The Contractor will submit Labels and Material Data Sheets for approval on all materials 30 days prior to use. An approval form, pesticide label, and MSDS will be submitted to the IPMP (Integrated Pest Management Program). The IPMP will forward it to AMC Command Entomologist for approval. Prospective bidders may suggest alternative herbicide prescriptions for suggestion only, which may be considered by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>14.2. PROCEDURE. The work shall be accomplished by broadcasting using a ground application, unless the Contracting Officer approves some other means in writing. Over the area to be treated, a relatively small number of oaks, hickories, and dogwoods were intentionally left standing during the timber harvesting operation for wildlife and aesthetic purposes (hence the term "modified clearcut"). The Contractor shall make every effort possible to avoid applying herbicide within the drip line of these trees that may result in mortality. Numerous other mast producing trees of the aforementioned species from seedling to sapling in size are scattered across the site and it is expected that these small trees will suffer mortality. Care shall be taken so that vegetation in areas adjacent to treatment areas is not damaged. The Contractor shall repair any damage caused by herbicide treatments at no additional cost to the Government. On the 156 acres where herbicides would be applied, about half of the acreage lends itself to application by mule type vehicles. The other half is so rough with irregular ground conditions and logging debris, such that the latter area is not appropriate for mules. Application by skidder or backpack is most appropriate here. Application on the entire acreage by skidder or backpack is recommended.</p>
<p>15. TREE PLANTING OPERATIONS</p>
<p>15.1. SCOPE. Contractor shall furnish all seedlings, labor, materials, equipment (including safety equipment), tools, transportation, supervision, and perform all work required to plant improved containerized longleaf pine seedlings on 156 acres at JB CHS-Weapons as indicated on the attached map in accordance with the specifications of the contract. All tree seedlings shall be planted no earlier than November 30, 2012 with the containerized longleaf seedlings planted prior to December 31, 2012.</p>
<p>15.2. ADVERSE SITE CONDITIONS. If unanticipated problems are encountered due to high water table or other uncontrollable factors, Contractor will be directed to plant these sites when conditions are favorable.</p>
<p>15.3. SEEDLINGS</p>
<p>15.3.1. Containerized Seedlings. The Contractor shall furnish containerized longleaf pine seedlings meeting the following specifications:</p>
<p>- Needle length must be 3 inches or greater and live. Completely dead, brown or <br />yellow needles are not acceptable (some at the bottom of the seedling are okay); <br />- Root collar diameter of 0.20 inches or greater; <br />- The taproot at the bottom of the plug should be air pruned and callused. <br />Lateral root tips visible on the outside of the plug should be firm and healthy.<br />Visible mycorrhiza is desirable; <br />- Plugs must be 3.0 cubic inches or greater in volume; <br />- Plugs must be a minimum of 3.25 inches deep; <br />- There cannot be any contaminating substances such as weed and grass seeds <br />and/or sprouting in the potting medium; <br />- Plugs must be intact; lost potting medium exposing the root system is not <br />acceptable. Plugs where the root has grown down the side of the potting medium <br />are okay; loose potting medium that easily washes or falls off during watering or <br />handling is not acceptable; <br />- Plugs must be firm, moist, and durable to hold up under planting conditions; <br />- Terminal bud must not be damaged. Contractor shall pick up the seedlings and transport them, in<br />a refrigerated truck, from the nursery to JB CHS-Weapons for planting.</p>
<p><br />15.4. STORAGE. The contractor shall take all necessary precautions to maintain healthy <br />seedlings. If the seedlings will not be planted within 5 days, the Contractor shall furnish <br />a temporary self- contained refrigerated storage unit. This unit shall be used for storage <br />of the containerized longleaf pine seedlings prior to actual planting operations. The placement of the refrigerated unit on JB CHC-Weapons will be as directed by the Government representative. The Government representative shall be granted ready access to the unit for purposes of inspecting the seedlings and their condition. The unit must be capable of holding the number of seedlings picked up at the designated location. The Contractor shall stack seedling containers in the unit to allow for proper ventilation around the seedling containers. If a refrigerated storage facility is needed, the Contractor shall perform all needed and required maintenance on the refrigerated unit. The refrigerated <br />unit shall be operated 24 hours per day, while seedlings are stored in the unit - to be kept <br />between 33 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit - and shall notify the Government representative if the <br />temperature rises above 38 degrees Fahrenheit; or if there is a refrigeration unit <br />breakdown. In case of refrigeration unit breakdown, repair or replacement time shall not <br />exceed 24 hours. It is the Contractor's responsibility to maintain the seedlings, and to <br />ensure that a replacement unit is available. If seedling spoilage occurs (determined by <br />Government representative), the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining replacement <br />seedlings.</p>
<p>15.5. SEEDLING TRANSPORTATION. The Contractor shall transport seedlings from the nursery <br />to the planting sites. All seedlings not in the process of being planted shall be kept in a <br />cool shaded area and covered with a heat reflective tarp.</p>
<p>15.6. CARE OF SEEDLINGS. The Contractor shall provide proper care for all containerized longleaf pine seedlings, from the time of pick up until they are planted. The Contractor shall provide all transportation for the seedlings, from the designated pick up location to the planting sites. <br />The Contractor shall keep records of weather, temperatures, delivery dates, dates of <br />planting of each shipment of seedlings, and the location of areas on which each shipment <br />of seedlings is planted; and furnish a copy of such records to the Government representative.</p>
<p>15.7. FIELD HANDLING STANDARDS. All planting shall be directly out of seedling containers. <br />- Unplantable seedlings are not to be planted. <br />- Unplantable seedlings are anything not meeting the specification in Section 16.3.1. <br />above. <br />-Seedling containers shall not be open to the weather elements at the planting crew's staging area<br />until seedlings are to be immediately planted. Seedlings carried by individual planters shall not<br />exceed the amount that can be carried or removed without injury, or which can be planted before<br />critical heating or drying occurs. <br />- Field Planting Standards. Hand planting with dibble bars or plug planting tools, <br />matching the plugs used, are acceptable planting methods. The planting site does not <br />lend itself to machine planting. <br />- Contractor's Planting Supervision Requirement. The Contractor for each crew of <br />hand planters shall designate a non-planting supervisor conversant in the English <br />language (spoken and written) in writing. The designation shall indicate the limit of the <br />supervisor's authority. When two or more people are designated as supervisor, their <br />written delegation shall indicate the priority of their designations so no more than one <br />person shall be in charge of a crew at any one time. A hand planting crew shall not <br />exceed twelve (12) people. The supervisor shall be with the crew at all times while the <br />crew is working. Each crew will perform as an individual working unit during normal <br />daily work operations. Crews will not be separated or divided into smaller working units <br />unless prior consent is received from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>15.8. RADIO COMMUNICATION. Communications will be required at all sites being worked <br />(such as CB or cellular phone).</p>
<p>15.9. GENERAL PLANTING INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
<p>- Plant one containerized tree seedling per planting spot in a vertical position in a <br />hole free of foreign material. Plant each seedling to a depth where the top of the root <br />collar is approximately one inch above the level of the surface of the soil. <br />- Planting spacing shall be on 6 foot by 10 foot grid. If all seedlings are properly <br />planted on a 6 foot by 10 foot spacing, there will be 726 seedlings planted per acre. The <br />row spacing shall not vary by more than 1 foot, and seedlings within rows by no more <br />than &frac12; foot, except where greater variance is necessitated by existing structures or <br />obstacles. Contractor will be required to adjust spacing within rows accordingly if trees <br />are not properly planted. Spacing of trees within rows must be equal over the entire area. <br />Row location may be adjusted as necessary to fit the terrain and avoid obstructions. <br />Seedlings shall not be planted within the drip line of live hardwoods remaining on the <br />site. <br />- Close planting hole at the bottom as well as the top to prevent subsurface air <br />pockets. Soil must be firmly packed around each planted seedling. Seedlings will be <br />planted to withstand being pulled from the ground by the terminal group of needles. <br />- Planting will not be allowed when soil conditions are unacceptable as <br />determined by the Government representative. <br />- Do not plant within 10 feet of any designated system road, fence, pipeline, <br />power line rights-of-way, or 20 feet from existing tree line unless instructed to do so by <br />the Contracting Officer. <br />- During the establishment of planting rows the planters shall be kept in line <br />along the entire course of the rows to avoid skips in the rows. When planting a square or <br />rectangular tract planters shall be lined up along one side of the tract to run rows to the <br />other side of the tract. Once the lead planter has reached the other end of the tract he/she <br />shall find the last row planted and begin a new row going back in the direction of the <br />original starting point. The lead planter shall not follow the block boundary around the perimeter of<br />the entire tract to be planted resulting in a spiral planting job.</p>
<p>15.10. NON-REFRIGERATED TRANSPORTATION AND PLANTING SITE STORAGE. While seedlings are being transported to planting sites and stored, seedlings shall be kept in storage boxes and covered to keep seedlings out of direct sunlight. When possible, the seedlings shall be <br />kept in a shaded area. Seedling boxes shall not have prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. Notify PAR if seedling roots appear to be dry. Inspect and repair damaged boxes immediately and keep tightly closed. Care should be taken to ensure that all seedlings temporarily stored on the site are planted that day.</p>
<p>15.11. GOVERNMENT INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE. The Government shall make inspection of the work performed under this contract as the planting progresses. The Government representative will check inspection records maintained by the Contractor for compliance with planting specifications and care and handling of seedlings.</p>
<p>-The Government representative will inspect the planting operation to ensure that all of the technical specifications are being followed. All contract areas will be sampled on a grid system. Sampling will consist of 1/100th acre plots to determine the total number of properly and improperly planted seedlings within the sample plots. Plots will be taken at a minimum of 1 per acre. The total average <br />number of planted seedlings per acre will be determined by adding the total number of <br />correctly planted trees per plot plus the total number of improperly planted trees per plot, <br />dividing by the stand acres and multiplying by 100 (1/100th acre plot). <br />- Acceptance. The specified number of seedlings per acre (Section l.2) must<br />be properly planted to receive 100% payment of bid price. Natural seedlings <br />(seedlings not planted by Contractor) shall not be considered when taking plots. <br />- Replanting. If the percentage of planting quality falls below 90% due to <br />insufficient number of properly planted trees, the Contractor will replant the site in order <br />to achieve a higher planting quality percentage.<br /><br />15.12. MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT.</p>
<p>- Method of Measurement. Acreage listed in the bid schedule was determined <br />by computerized traverse, and for the purposes of this contract, is considered actual <br />acreage and not an estimate. Any acreage added or deleted under the changes clause of <br />the contract will be measured using the above described method. Number of acres <br />satisfactorily planted also will be determined using the above described method. <br />- Basis of Payment. Payment will be made at a rate up to, but not to exceed, <br />unit bid price for each site accepted as satisfactorily completed by the Contractor. <br />Deductions for the unit price bid will be made for inadequate quantity of properly planted <br />seedlings and/or lost or "waste" seedlings as follows: <br />Deduction for inadequate quantity of properly planted trees. To receive <br />100% of the unit price bid, Contractor must properly plant the number of plantable trees <br />specified below. The Government may accept lesser quantities at their option at the <br />payment rates shown below.<br /><br />Number of properly planted trees per acre/ Payment percent of unit bid price <br />_________________ ________________ <br />708-726/ 100.0% <br />690-707/ 97.5% 672-689/ 95.0% <br />653-671/ 92.5% <br />632-652 /90.0% <br />&lt; or = 631 FAILURE</p>
<p>The maximum allowable number of seedlings per acre is 813. Any seedling above this <br />amount will be counted as "waste" seedlings. If the quality of work falls below 90% (653), <br />work will be considered unacceptable and will be rejected in accordance with Inspection and Acceptance procedures.</p>
<p><br />16. SCHEDULE <br />Extension of completion dates will be granted for conditions that cannot be controlled by <br />the contractor (e.g. military related delays). Extension of the completion dates will not be <br />granted for the conditions that can be controlled by the Contractor (e.g., equipment <br />breakdown; employee problems). The specified time for completion is as follows:</p>
<p>Phase Completion Date <br />Herbicide application of all designated areas June 1, 2012- October 31, 2012 (September 1, 2012 preferred). <br />Tree planting of all designated areas not prior to November 30, 2012 and completed by December 31, 2012 for containerized longleaf pines.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the solicitation. The NAICS Code is 562910 with a size standard of $14 M. The reference number is H94003-12-T-0006. This requirement is to provide emergency response services to Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), 4234 54th St, McClellan, CA. The contractor will provide containment, clean-up, remediation, and/or hazardous materials/waste when requested by DMEA. The purpose of this contract is to provide emergency response to DMEA in the event that these services would be required. The contractor provide containment, clean-up, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials/waste resulting from a spill or release of any of the hazardous materials stored or processed at DMEA or transported from our facility to another site. Requirements: The emergency response contractor must have technically qualified personnel on the emergency response team.

This shall include the technical services of a certified industrial hygienist, chemist, environmental engineer, certified health physicist, etc. All emergency responders must have a minimum 40 hour HAZWOPER training (compliance with 29 CFR 1910.120 and CCR, Title 8, 5192), and 1 year experience of responding to various chemical spills within the state of California. At the direction of DMEA, the contractor will be required to respond to chemical spills/releases during the transportation of DMEA hazardous wastes or materials. This could include responses anywhere along the transportation routes and therefore the emergency contractor must have multiple emergency response teams that would be able to respond within 3 hours or less. The contractor must have the capability to respond at the discretion of DMEA to emergencies any time the need arises. The requirement is for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week including holidays and weekends. The contractor, at the direction of DMEA, will be required to properly dispose of the hazardous wastes that are generated from a spill/release. This includes as a minimum hazardous waste characterization (if required), labeling/placarding, manifesting, and transportation to a licensed hazardous waste disposal site.

The emergency response service provider shall provide DMEA with a single call number that will activate an emergency response team with the capability to properly handle any type of spill/release that could be encountered at DMEA. DMEA must be able to speak with a "live" member of the emergency response team who is knowledgeable regarding hazardous materials and emergency response and not to a dispatch service (operator) who would have to contact others to response to technical questions. The person who answers the emergency telephone call shall have as a minimum 40 hour HAZWOPER training and one year experience responding to chemical spills. The emergency response time shall not be greater than&nbsp;two hours from the time the emergency response call is initiated by DMEA. The preference is to have the emergency response team on-site as soon as possible, but within 1 to 2 hours from the time the emergency response contractor is notified. All responders must comply with all federal, state, and local requirements including the mandated training requirements. The contractor shall not discuss the nature or extent of their involvement with any incident involving DMEA facility, chemicals, or processes with any other agencies (including the media) or other individuals without prior permission from DMEA. The contractor shall have liability insurance. The liability insurance shall be a minimum of $1,000,000 (USD). After the emergency contractor has responded to an incident, the contractor shall provide a written report within 48 hours to DMEA's Environmental, Health and Safety Manager. This report shall include the nature and extent of the spill/release, procedures to contain and/or mitigate the hazardous chemicals, notifications made to any agencies, results of any sampling or monitoring, and any other pertinent information related to the spill/release as deemed necessary by DMEA. It is anticipated this contract will be awarded as a time and materials contract. The duration of this contract will be one 12 month base year plus two option years. Proposal Submissions: A current emergency response price schedule shall be provided to DMEA Contracting (MEE). The price schedule shall include the labor rates for the different positions (e.g. certified industrial hygienist, chemist, technician, etc.), costs associated with the personal protective equipment (e.g. Level A suits, Tyvek suits, gloves, respirators, etc.), costs for various types of materials (e.g. overpack drums, booms, liners, etc.) and any other miscellaneous supplies or equipment. Provide the list of names of individuals with their education, experience and training as it pertains to emergency response for those who could be requested to respond to a chemical emergency at DMEA. Provide two examples of chemical emergencies that the contractor was called upon to mitigate. These examples shall include the nature and extent of the emergency response including the containment and clean up; however, for privacy reasons the contractor does not have include the name and location of the incident. Security: As a Department of Defense facility, access to DMEA is limited to authorized US citizens only. All emergency personnel responding to DMEA must be citizens of the United States of America. A list of names of the potential emergency responders must be provided in advance to DMEA and must be updated as necessary. Emergency response personnel may require a background check prior to working on-site. DMEA reserves the right to preclude access to our facility any of the contractor personnel for security concerns.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 1102348. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-59 dated May 10, 2012.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 541380- Testing Laboratories; Small Business Size Standard is $14 million and is set-aside for small business concerns.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) is soliciting for a contractor to perform the assessment of mRNA gene expression changes in rat liver using Next-Generation sequencing technology (Next-Gen).</p>
<p>Next-Gen is required in order to provide full coverage of all the genes expressed in the rat livers after exposure to various hepatotoxicants. The Next-Gen platform that has been used for previous and on-going projects is the Illumina sequencing technology. The government must be able to make one to one comparisons between the data without introducing bias. An estimated total of 324 samples will be analyzed to compare the effect of the different hepatotoxicants on the hepatic expression of the genes. The government reserves the right to change the quantity of analyses required. Ultimately, the gene expression changes will be used as biomarkers of drug-induced liver injury. The government will provide total RNA to the contractor. The work is being conducted the protocol entitled "Biomarkers of Hepatotoxcicity". The purpose of this study is to identify gene expression changes that can provide better prediction of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicants in preclinical species, such as rats.</p>
<p><br />Performance requirements:<br />a. The contractor must independently assess the quantity and quality of the RNA provided by the government to ensure that it is acceptable for sequencing.<br />b. Preparation of libraries from the mRNA that can be run on the Next-Gen platform.<br />c. Sequencing of the libraries using Illumina sequencing technology. The parameters for the sequencing are paired end reads, 50 bases minimum per read, and a depth of coverage of at least 12 million read pairs per sample.<br />d. Alignment of the read data to the current reference&nbsp;rat genome and transcriptome with transcript identifications assigned from the UCSC Known Gene table as the definition for both gene and transcript level expression, modified so that transcript IDs are guaranteed to be unique. At least 85% unambiguous alignment to the transcriptome and genome is required. Contractor's samples that fail to meet the requirement shall be re-analyzed at no additional cost to the government.<br />e. The following data analysis and output must be provided. The data will be provided on a portable hard drive of sufficient capacity to hold all the data (multiple hard drives may be used if the amount of data requires it).<br />1. FASTQ file for each sample. <br />2. A table of the flow cell statistics outlining the quality and yield of the flow cell(s) where samples were clustered and sequenced.<br />3. QC files regarding any presence of artifact/duplicate sequences, along with base distributions and qualities.<br />4. A tab-delimited text file with collapsed and normalized counts for each detected gene and isoform (UCSC Known Gene) for each specimen. <br />5.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled PIP INFILTRATION OF COMPOSITE PREFORMS which was posted on May 31, 2012. You are notified that the following changes are made: Q: Are the 3D preforms already partially densified via CVI, and if so, what is the remaining % open porosity? A: The composite preforms are partially densified and contain ~30% open porosity. Under ideal conditions it is possible to infiltrate these preforms with ~50% particulates. Of course that depends on viscosity of particulate filled polymer, particle size distribution and pore size distribution of the composite preform. However, NASA will consider recommendations from the vendor concerning particle loading and maximum density. Q:  NASA specifies the conditions for one heat treatment cycle in argon at 1650C (RFQ states 16500C); are the other cycles also to be conducted in argon? A: If N is the# of PIP cycles required for achieving maximum density in the composite preform, then after N-1 cycles, the infiltrated composite preform needs to be heat treated at 16500C in argon. There is no need to conduct all PIP cycles in argon. However, high temperature PIP processing in argon is preferable to avoid amorphous phases and oxygen impurities in the PIP matrix. PIP processing in nitrogen or air causes contamination of PIP matrix and degradation of composite preforms.  There is no temperature requirement for the other cycles.  However, the PIP processing temperature should yield crystalline and dense matrix with least amount of oxygen impurities.  Clarification: In the current RFQ there is no requirement for seal coating. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to provide questions and&nbsp;answers in relation to this solicitation.&nbsp; As a result, the closing date and time of this solicitation is extended to 12:00pm EDT, Friday, June 15, 2012.&nbsp; All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.<br /><br /><br />Q1: Is the AmeriCorps NCCC is aware that the life span of copper-based networks and equipment is reaching its end-of-useful-life?</p>
<p>Discussion: The ability of copper to provide the bandwidth requirements for future equipment needs is limited. Fiber is the only Information Transport System (ITS) that can provide the required bandwidth and meet future requirements. It is extremely wasteful to consider a copper ITS and not a fiber ITS. That said with the Government's push for more secure networks, IPv6 compliance, and the use of green technologies (Exec. Order 13423 and 13514) denotes that Government agencies move away from copper networks to green solutions such as Passive Optical Network (PON) solutions (fiber). In addition on average based on 250 user ports (data, voice, and video) the cost per copper data port is approx. $1,300 and the cost of fiber port is approx. $800. In addition, there is an approx. 65% savings in Operational Cost (OpEx) of the LAN due to reduced power and HVAC requirements and yearly savings on the reduction of SmartNet's required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A1: The NCCC is looking simply for copper to run from internal switches to the user. Per discussions with our landlord, the State of Iowa, copper is still the industry standard for transmission to the desktop. Copper will carry 10Gb to the user, well more than we will possibly require in the next 10-20 years as our current transmission line externally is a pair of T1 lines totaling about 3Gb for the entire office.</p>

<p>FAR Provision 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010), is incorporated in full text as follows: (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- (A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for receipt of offers is 11 June 2012, 2:00 pm e.s.t. All responsible and responsive sources are invited to submit an offer which will be considered by this agency. Companies shall provide a valid DUNS, be registered with Central Contractor Registrations (CCR) and shall provide the company Tax Identification Number (TIN) with their offer.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Jawaid A. Siddiqui<br />Head of Strategy and Business Development<br />Premier Mercantile Services (Pvt.) Ltd.<br />2nd Floor, Business Plaza<br />Mumtaz Hasan Road <br />Karachi - 74000 <br />Pakistan<br />Phone: 0092 21 32400450-3, Ext 820<br />Fax: 92 21 2414492 2400281</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance in the development of the infrastructure, operational, and business requirements of acquiring and operating a fleet of locomotives on the existing Karachi-Lahore Railway. The Contractor will develop recommendations on anticipated freight volumes, fleet sizing, and financing requirements, as well as tender documents for the procurement of locomotives for Premier Mercantile Services (Pvt.) Ltd. (PMS) (Grantee).</p>
<p>PMS is a developer and operator of port and intermodal transportation facilities, and has concessions to operate, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, a container terminal at the Port of Karachi, a bulk goods terminal at the neighboring Port of Qasim, and an inland container depot near Lahore. The inland container terminal is an important distribution point for northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. The facilities are connected by rail, owned by Pakistan Railways (PR), the Pakistani government's state-owned railway company. However, PR is unable to handle the required volume of freight due to a shortage of properly maintained vehicles. To address the problem, PMS has reached an agreement with PR which will allow PMS to operate its own fleet of freight trains on PR-owned track, thereby augmenting the capacity of one of Pakistan's most important trade corridors.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide technical assistance to the Grantee in the assessment of future freight volumes and transportation requirements to inform the Grantee's decisions regarding the procurement of a fleet of locomotives. This technical assistance will involve the development of bidding documents for the Grantee's use during the procurement process. The Contractor will also provide recommendations on security, and will prepare an operational and business plan for the implementation and efficient operation of the Project, including an assessment of PR's current communications and signaling infrastructure and procedures.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $628,000 grant to PMS from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00 pm on July 13, 2012</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>Question:<br />Why did the Contracting Officer decide to post this requirement as an Unrestricted Acquisition?
<p>Answer:<br />This acquisition has several issues that drove the decision to not set this aside for small business. The biggest factor was the applicability of the Non-Manufacturer Rule. The Contracting Officer, in coordination with Air Combat Command Contracting and the Small Business Administration made the determination that this requirement should be solicited under NAICS 332510, which is a manufacturing NAICS code. The Non-manufacturer Rule states a firm that receives a supply contract under a small business set aside they MUST be either a manufacturer of a small business product or must agree to supply the product of a domestic small manufacturer or processor if not the manufacturer themselves. Since this contract encompasses such a vast variety of supplies, it is not feasible for a single small business to manufacture or provide items manufactured by other small businesses to meet all of the requirements under this acquisition. Therefore, the decision was made to post this requirement as an Unrestricted acquisition.</p>

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br /><br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

Each interested company will be limited to two participants.  The Government reserves the right to limit the number of company participants to one, in the event that more than twenty companies show interest in participating in the Site Visit, so that more companies can attend.  The Government is not responsible for late registrations.  Registration for participation in this APS-5/ITM Site Visit must be made no later than 5:00pm CST on June 20, 2012.  Interested companies should respond by emailing Ms. Iris Padro, Contract Specialist, at usarmy.ria.asc.mbx.aps-5-kuwait@mail.mil.

No telephone questions or inquiries are acceptable.<br><br>Intent of Dialogue: We intend this site visit to be a forum for an informative and open dialogue to ensure contractors gain as complete an understanding of the requirement as possible.  Government responses will not be binding.  If a contractor wants an official answer, it must submit the question in writing, and the Procuring Contracting Officer will answer the question in writing. <br><br>Rules for Discussion:  No side bar discussions - Out of respect for the rest of the Site Visit participants, and to ensure an equal opportunity to hear the same information, we ask all participants to refrain from side bar conversations with the personnel conducting the tour, and/or personnel working on the site.  Please direct your questions to the person conducting the tour.  If a participant asks a question, it must be brought to the attention of the group and answered publicly.  Taking photographs and/or making recordings of any kind is strictly prohibited.  <br><br>Transportation and On-Site Related Issues:  Transportation and security will be provided by the Government while conducting the tours of each location, as well as to and from the tour sites.  Designated pickup points will be announced at a later date.  For security reasons, all participants must use the Government-provided transportation.  Contractors must be accompanied at all times.  If the participants are separated, then questions should be reserved for a public forum.  Bottom-line, all participants must receive the same information.  (NOTE: All parties are responsible for transportation to and from the country of Kuwait and to and from Kuwait City International Airport (KCIA) and their choice of lodging.  No entitlements to payment or charges to the Government will arise as a result of this site visit.) <br>   	Instructions for installation access will be provided at a later date.<br><br>Site Visit Conclusion:  When the Site Visit is concluded, any further questions you develop shall be submitted to the Procuring Contracting Officer, not to the personnel who conducted the tour.<br><br>Contractors are reminded that, when released, the RFP and PWS shall take precedence over any observation from the Site Visit.

<DESC>United States Army Project Manager Electronic Warfare (PM EW) requests industry comments on the clarity, format, and technical detail of the Electronic Warfare Planning & Management Tool (EWPMT) "DRAFT Performance Based Specification (PBS)." This specification covers the EWPMT for the Integrated Electronic Warfare System (IEWS).  IEWS will provide commanders from Corps to Company focusing on the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) with an organic EW capability that dramatically improves a land force's ability to seize, retain, and exploit an advantage within the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) in order to execute decisive operations successfully.<br><br>EWPMT is a software program giving EWOs a mission planning capability to plan, coordinate, manage, and de-conflict unit EW activities.  It will provide battle management for distributed, networked EW capability, aligned with fires and synchronize air and ground electromagnetic spectrum operations across the G2/3/6.  EWPMT capabilities include producing EW orders and estimates, plan and appropriately employ EW assets, conduct effective EW targeting using lethal and non-lethal fires support; enhance development of the Electronic Order of Battle; and conduct EW battle damage assessment.  EMPMT will provide a risk assessment and Course of Action (COA) development for EW missions with all software applications and tools that will be instantiated as a set of services to be run within the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) and one or more presentation-layer widgets to be run on a thin client laptop. <br>	 <br>PM EW requests all comments/questions be submitted not later than 22 June 2012 using the provided, standard Comment Resolution Format (CRM).  All comments will be reviewed by the Government PBS team whose goal is to provide as much clarity and detail within the PBS to support a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Note: This request is for planning purposes only in accordance with FAR 15.201 and does not constitute a RFP.  Additionally, this request should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to eventually issue an RFP.  <br><br>CRM responses shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer at the following email address: Patrick.Morse1@us.army.mil.<br><br>CRM responses and any technical questions shall also be addressed to Mr. Steve Abbott, Lead Engineer PM EW, at the following email address: steve.abbott@us.army.mil.

<DESC><p>*THIS UPDATED NOTICE SUPERSEDES ANY PREVIOUSLY ISSUED NOTICES FOR SOLICITATION #HQ0276-12-R-0001. <br /><br />This pre-solicitation notice is being issued to communicate the Government's intent to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 for Full and Open Competition for the Development and Initial Production of Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIB, or SM-3 IIB Interceptors. For planning purposes only, the Government anticipates the product development final solicitation will be released in the 4th quarter of FY13, with a contract award in the 4th quarter of FY14. At this time, there are no anticipated partial or total set-asides for this acquisition. The Agency plans to award to U.S. owned companies only. <br /><br />The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing a Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) System; integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States (U.S.), friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The SM-3 IIB is a key element to expanding the battle space by adding an additional layer to our homeland defense against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). The goals of the program are to develop an operational, hit-to-kill missile fielded in the 2021 timeframe to counter first generation ICBMs targeted at the U.S. Homeland early in their flight. It will serve as the first tier of the layered defense of the U.S. Homeland. The SM-3 Block IIB missile will also provide a large defended area against regional, intermediate range ballistic missiles. The SM-3 IIB will be integrated into the Aegis Weapon System, using Aegis BMD 5.1 and the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System as a point of departure. The SM-3 IIB will be launched using Engage on Remote data, leveraging the BMD distributed sensor architecture and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) network. The SM-3 IIB is required to be both land and sea compliant, and is targeted for incorporation into Phase 4 of the President's Phased Adaptive Approach.<br /><br />The successful offeror(s) will need to demonstrate prime contractor experience in designing, developing, and manufacturing state-of-the-art ballistic missile defense interceptors, experience in land and/or sea-based interceptor system integration, and demonstrated interceptor production and sustainment capability.<br /><br />TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:<br />The following criteria has been developed to guide prospective offeror(s) as to the priorities applied to the evaluation of future technical proposals. These criteria are preliminary and may be modified prior to release of the final solicitation.<br /><br />1. ICBM Defense Performance*<br />1.1. Defended Area of U.S. Homeland<br />1.2. Launch Area Denied<br />1.3. Level of protection <br />1.4. Maximize Government defined Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 4 operational architecture<br />1.5. Maximize reliability<br />* See paragraph CLASSIFIED ATTACHMENTS below, which describe how to request additional information.<br /><br />2. Minimized Life Cycle Cost<br />2.1. Minimize modifications to Aegis Weapon System<br />2.2. Simplicity of design for operations and sustainment<br />2.3. Minimize unit cost<br />2.4. Minimize fleet management cost of ICBM interceptors<br /><br />3. Schedule Realism<br />As in all source selections, the Government will evaluate Technical, Management, Past Performance, and Cost proposals.</p>
<p>FUTURE UPDATES:<br />This pre-solicitation notification, as well as any subsequent procurement notifications, will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC><strong>The purpose of this modification is to revise the "Description" field of the Pre-Solicitation announcement to incorporate a brief description of the Electronic Contract Proposal Submission (eCPS)&nbsp;website requirements that are applicable to this solicitation:<br /><br /></strong>The NIAID provides immunological and virological support for nonhuman primate (NHP) conducted at NIAID's Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit (SVEU) contract sites and by DIADS-supported vaccine researchers through three existing NHP Core Laboratories (NHP Core Labs): the Humoral Immunology Core Lab, the Cellular Immunology Core Lab, and the Viral Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Core Lab. The Functional Genomics NHP Core Laboratory will thus become a fourth NHP Core Lab. The objective of the Core Laboratories has been to insure standardization and comparability of functional genomics services and assays conducted for these SVEU and DAIDS-supported preclinical NHP studies.
<p>The purpose of the proposed contract will be to provide support for a Functional Genomics NHP Core Laboratory for the conduct and improvement of assays designed to generate specific quantitative genomic expression profiles and network diagrams from RNA samples obtained from NHPs enrolled in priority SVEU protocols and DAIDS-supported investigator-initiated NHP studies.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall compile and analyze the generated data using bioinformatics and biocomputing tools (e.g., unbiased hierarchical clustering methods, sophisticated network algorithms, etc.) with the intent of identifying gene signatures that could potentially define correlates of protection and predict vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a 1-year Base period plus four 1-year options for a possible total period of performance of 5 years beginning on or about June 17, 2013. The performance requirement will be for the delivery of 3.85 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the base period (Year 1) and option periods (Years 2 through 5), which may be unilaterally exercised by the Government. In addition, the Government may unilaterally exercise options to accommodate significant increases in work to be provided for the base period and option periods. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by .95 FTE for each option exercised. The Government may exercise an option up to two times in any year of the contract.<br /><br /><strong>For this solicitation, the NIAID requires proposals to be submitted in three methods: (1) Paper, (2) Disc (CD or DVD), and (3) Online via the NIAID Electronic Contract Proposal Submission (eCPS) website. The content of the paper, disc, and online proposals must be identical. Submission of proposals by facsimile or e-mail is not acceptable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For directions on using eCPS, go to the website https://ecps.niaid.nih.gov and then click on "How to Submit."</strong></p>
<p><strong>To submit online using eCPS, offerors must have a valid NIH electronic Research Administration (eRA) Commons account, which provides authentication and serves as a vehicle for secure transmission of documents and communication with the NIAID. The eRA Commons registration process may take up to 4 weeks. For more information, please see </strong><a href="http://era.nih.gov/applicants/how-to_steps.cfm#register"><strong>http://era.nih.gov/applicants/how-to_steps.cfm#register</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about May 14, 2012, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This notice is made in accordance with FAR Part 5.203 and will account for the 15 day pre-solicitation issuance requirement. The anticipated release date for the solicitation is June 1, 2011. <br /><br />The Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), Office of Security Technology (ST) has a requirement for a qualified contractor to provide a robust, cradle-to-grave Supply Chain Management (SCM) service. ST envisions a holistic approach to supply chain, with a strong management infrastructure capable of integrating and managing the flow of products and information. The goal is multifold: to create a responsive, proactive and cost-effective supply chain capable of not only managing a catalog of more than five-thousand unique products and distributing them to over 147 domestic and 285 overseas DOS facilities with real-time visibility, tracking and accurate lead times; but to provide like services for any other items ordered in support of DOS critical needs. <br /><br />Due to the unique, sometimes dangerous and hostile locations of DOS facilities, ST must maintain the ability to apply cutting edge technology to new problems in information and personnel protection. The contractor will need to possess an expert knowledge of Technical Security Systems (TSS) in order to fulfill the technology development aspect of the supply chain. The objectives are for the SCM Contractor to:
<p>&bull;Ensure best value pricing of products and services;</p>
<p>&bull;Reduce the time to obtain products and services, ensuring predictable, consistent lead times;</p>
<p>&bull;Standardize staging of equipment for shipping and implementation;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide reliable, on schedule deliveries worldwide;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide customer's real-time visibility into the supply chain process;</p>
<p>&bull;Manage costs and obsolescence through equipment repair;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide technical assistance and life-cycle support to perimeter X-Ray, explosive detection equipment, and other specialized equipment;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide real-time order status, accurate delivery schedules, and delivery confirmation notices to the ordering activity and installation contractors, of any item ordered (not merely those noted in the aforementioned catalog);</p>
<p>&bull;Facilitate the customs process for in-country receipt of overseas shipments;</p>
<p>&bull;Identify and develop technology to improve technical security capability, minimize security vulnerabilities, and reduce costs;</p>
<p>&bull;Maintain the technical specification documents for TSS;</p>
<p>&bull;Test and evaluate identified commercial-off-the-shelf equipment or systems for approval or disapproval;</p>
<p>&bull;Identify and incorporate innovative, superior technology in DS-approved equipment and systems while staying abreast of new developments and technologies;</p>
<p>&bull;Conduct market research, product surveys, systems integration efforts, and product comparisons to ensure the best possible technology or solution is used;</p>
<p>&bull;If no commercial-off-the-shelf products are available, design and develop specialized technical security applications, equipment, and solutions as required with approval to support appropriate standards;</p>
<p>&bull;Develop, create and maintain documentation for customer requirements, technology needs assessments, concept of operations, system specifications, product test and evaluation, pilot project plans, equipment deployment, technical drawings, technical bulletins and new product bulletins;</p>
<p>&bull;Assist the DS Training Center to create and maintain training materials for new equipment;</p>
<p>&bull;Assist customers with troubleshooting and equipment deployment;</p>
<p>&bull;Research, evaluate, and present recommendations for new locking hardware;</p>
<p>&bull;Provide lock support and technical assistance, and</p>
<p>&bull;Maintain online document repositories that include equipment bulletins, deployment documentation, manufacturer's literature, and drawings.</p>
<p>This contract will be unique in that ST anticipates awarding three separate but critically related contracts to support the delivery and installation of TSS to domestic and overseas posts. Each Contractor shall be required to collaborate to create the most effective and efficient support organization for meeting ST goals. To ensure that product delivery is coordinated with installation, Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA) shall be required. ACAs shall be applicable for any portion of the contract that necessitates joint participation in the accomplishment of the Government's requirement. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is one (1) base year and four (4) one-year options. This requirement will be solicited using 100% full and open competition. The Government reserves the right to issue multi-type task orders for specific tasks approved by the Contracting Officer. Contractor performance will be measured in accordance with the metrics specified in each task order. The contract will be awarded utilizing the best value trade-off source selection methodology. This means that the offeror's plan of operation is more significant than cost. As technical merit of the Offeror's proposals become more equal, the evaluated cost or price may become the determining factor. The National American Individual Classification Standard (NAICS) code for procurement is 541614, Process, Physical Distribution and Logistics Consulting Services</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to possess a SECRET Facility Clearance at the time of proposal submission. The contractor must have the ability to obtain a TOP SECRET Facility Clearance.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this amendment is to provide notification of adding funding in the amount of $44,705.00 for purposes of incorporating necessary open market items as part of the Battelle task order HSHQDC-12-F-00048. The open market items consist of service, maintenance and calibration agreements for existing mission critical equipment and systems; technical data analysis hardware and components; data storage elements; testing materials and machining; and laboratory supplies and consumables. These items are critical for support of the services performed under the subject Task Order and are needed to keep mission critical equipment and systems running properly. These items are utilized daily in the operation of requirements execution within the three (3) Transportation Security Laboratory core laboratories (Bulk Detection, Explosives Effects, and Electromagnetic Energy). The usage of these items will ensure that DHS mission critical equipment and systems are maintained and properly operational according to the manufacturer's' specifications. Without continued laboratory operations using this mission critical equipment and systems, the Government will be unable to respond immediately to emerging threats or specific threat events, which could result in the loss of life should terrorist actions succeed.<br /><br />This action increases the total obligated amount of the task order from $549,890.00 by $44,705.00 to $594,595.00. The revised ceiling amount of the task order is $594,595.00.<br /><br />The Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (J&amp;A)&nbsp;is attached.</p>

<DESC>The mission of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is to develop and procure medical countermeasures that address the public health and medical consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) accidents, incidents and attacks, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. Specifically, BARDA supports the advanced development and procurement of drugs, vaccines and other products that are considered priorities for national health security. BARDA funding bridges the "valley of death" characterizing the late stages of product development. BARDA's support ensures continuity of funding at a critical point for medical countermeasures developed by industry or emerging from the basic research and preclinical development activities sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In procuring medical countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile, BARDA enhances the capabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to organize an effective response.
<p>The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act (PAHPA) directs BARDA to promote (i) innovations in technologies that may assist countermeasure and product advanced research and development, (ii) research on and development of research tools and other devices and technologies, and (iii) research to promote strategic initiatives. The 2011 BARDA Strategic Plan defines BARDA's vision and lays out a series of capability goals over a five year period (2011-2016). Amongst BARDA's guiding principles is supporting the development of novel platform technologies that provide flexible systems for the production of medical countermeasures against a variety of threats. Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), BARDA seeks to address, in part, BARDA's Goal 4, responsive and nimble programs and capabilities to address novel and emerging threats, as well as support the technological and scientific advancements of medical countermeasures for biodefense and pandemic influenza. The PAHPA and BARDA Strategic Plan are located on the ASPR website: http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/pahpa/pages/default.aspx and http://www.phe.gov/about/barda/Pages/2011barda-stratplan.aspx.</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is a continuation of a previous BAA (BARDA-BAA-11-100-SOL-00001) and is similarly designed to promote science and technology advancements of platforms applied to MCM development for the Strategic Science and Technology Division (SST) of BARDA.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to solicit potential advancements in science and technology in the following BARDA SST Areas of Interest:</p>
<p>1.Pipeline acceleration and evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.</p>
<p>2.Product improvements to enhance safety, efficacy, ease of use, and manufacturability of MCM.</p>
<p>3.Product repurposing to treat novel and emerging pathogens.</p>
<p>4.In vitro diagnostic platforms for the rapid diagnosis of human infection.</p>
<p>The specific application of the technologies will focus on biodefense, pandemic influenza, and other emerging infectious diseases (EID). BARDA is open to evaluation of technologies at multiple stages of development, but advanced development activities of products specific for CBRN and Influenza will not be considered. Development activities are to be fully integrated with regulatory activities associated with product development efforts.</p>
<p>BARDA anticipates awarding multiple contracts and/or other transactions for research and development efforts from this BAA that have sufficient potential for success, are of interest to the Government, and support one or more of the listed BARDA SST Areas of Interest.</p>
<p>Contact Information:<br />Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis BARDA-BAA-12-100-SOL-00013 may be submitted to SST-BAA@hhs.gov.</p>

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (Corporation) plans to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for a contractor to construct/install an ice flushing system at Snell lock in Massena, New York. Snell Lock is a navigation lock that is 80 feet wide and 860 feet long from gate to gate and&nbsp;raises and lowers vessels approximately 43 feet. Snell Lock is in service from late March until late December each year. Typically during the opening and closing periods, ice needs to be flushed from the lock to make room&nbsp;for transiting vessels. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The project includes installation of seven (7) steel pipes approximately 50 feet in length having approximate cross-sectional areas of 12 square feet with cross sections varying from rectangular to round. These pipes shall be embedded in the upstream concrete miter gate sill with intakes upstream of the miter gate and outlets in the downstream face of the sill. Each pipe will be fitted with two (2) knife gate valves having openings 5 feet - 7 inches wide and 2 feet - 3 inches high with one (1) valve being electrically operated and the other manually operated. The work will require removal of approximately 1,800 cubic yards of concrete and placement of approximately 1,000 cubic yards of steel reinforced concrete to install the steel pipes and to enlarge a concrete gallery through the miter gate sill at the lock. The work will also include connecting the knife gate actuators to an existing power source, integrating the controls for the new valves with the existing lock operating controls and installing a new access stairway. The work&nbsp;to be performed inside&nbsp;the lock will need to be completed during the 2013 winter shutdown period beginning in January 2013 during an approximate ten (10) week period when the lock is dewatered. Work in the gallery through the miter gate sill that will not interfere with navigation shall be accomplished during the 2013 Navigation Season which begins in late March 3013. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Cost range for this project&nbsp;will be between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The anticipated release date for the IFB is&nbsp;May 18, 2012 with a bid opening date of July 9, 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An anticipated firm, fixed price contract will be awarded on or about July 13, 2012. One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.</span></p>

The anticipated date for the government's receipt of proposals is on or about 29 February 2012.

Answers to Questions 18 and 19:

18.Question: A contradiction exists in the Commercial Item Description A-A-52696 as it relates to the Header cloth. In paragraph 2.1 the CID states the weight of the Duck is to be 8.5 oz. minimum per square yard. In paragraph 2.1.5 the CID states the weight to be 7 ounces to 8.25 ounces per square yard. Please confirm that the Duck cloth acceptable range for the Duck cloth remains 7 to 8.5 ounces per square yard. 

Answer:  See below.

19.Question: Under the current production contracts for the Interment Flag Para. 2.1.6 of the Commercial Item Description was modified to state "the looper thread must be on the white portion of the flag". Please confirm that this modification will remain valid for the current RFP. 

Answer: The CID is amended:

The specifications are the same as those in Federal Specification CID-A-A-52696 except as noted: 

NOTE: 2.1 The Standard for Yarns per inch, Warp, Duck, reads 84 for Cotton and Cotton-Polyester. This standard is revised for this requirement to 34 yarns per inch for Cotton and Cotton-Polyester. 
NOTE: 2.1.5 Heading is modified to specify the duck will be a minimum of 8.5 oz per square yard IAW paragraph 2.1 
NOTE: 2.1.6 Stitching. Paragraph is modified to state, "the looper thread must be on the white portion of the flag". 
NOTE: 3.2 First Article Testing Samples. 6 complete interment flags shall be submitted for first article testing after contract award. 
NOTE: 5.3 References to NSNs are removed


Final questions are due NLT 4:00PM EST February 14, 2012. Any questions or comments must be emailed to jesse.hardy@va.gov and patrick.mckeown@va.gov.  Please note, all questions and answers will be posted to this site and publicly available.  Interested party company names will be redacted from any postings.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
AUTHORITY:  41 U.S.C. 253(C)(1) ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE
US Department of Energy Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant Project Support
DOE Contract No. DE-EM0002065 Robert L. Fish (doing business as ROBEDON)
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of River Protection (ORP) plans to contract by means other than full and open competition.  This document provides the justification and approval of the use of one of the exceptions to full and open competition allowed under the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.3 ? Other Than Full and Open Competition.
Nature And/Or Description Of The Action Being Approved:  DOE ORP intends to award a sole source contract to ROBEDON of Las Vegas, Nevada.  ROBEDON will provide technical support and expertise to DOE Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) Project Office as it relates to materials selection, component fabrication, and materials performance issues for all Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant facilities. 
A Description Of The Supplies Or Services Required To Meet The Agency's Needs (Including The Estimated Value):  DOE ORP requires consulting services for the WTP Engineering Division (WED) for project controls analysis and support for all areas of the WTP Project, including (a) the identification of areas of possible concern regarding project performance and preparation of analyses that provides a reasonable basis for recommending whether actions could be taken by DOE, (b) assessing whether existing contract requirements could be optimized without adversely impacting the project cost or schedule, (c) providing technical support in the preparation of reports to DOE senior management regarding areas of performance improvement for federal and contractor staff, and (d) supporting the area federal project directors by assessing areas of the contractor?s cost, schedule, earned value, and technical performance.  The estimated dollar value for this procurement is approximately $135,00 0.  An Identification Of The Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full And Open Competition: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) determines that only one responsible source exists and no other supplier or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
A Demonstration That The Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications Or The Nature Of The Acquisition Requires Use Of The Authority Cited: DOE ORP has determined that this requirement can only be satisfied by unique services that are only available from ROBEDON.  ROBEDON is the only known source uniquely capable of providing consulting services to support reviews of WTP contractor responses and proposed corrective action plans to resolve and address the Level 1 Finding in the area of vessel corrosion.  ROBEDON is the only known source that possesses the vast experience and knowledge associated with the WTP needed to perform the required tasks within the required schedule and available budget.  For example, ROBEDON is the only known source with (a) direct involvement with surveillances in the areas of materials selection and corrosion of vessels in the WTP, (b) experience as a senior materials engineer, and (c) hands-on experience in oversight of the WTP contract for the desig n and construction of the WTP.  ROBEDON is the only known source that can begin the work immediately with no need for additional WTP staff time and resources to conduct orientation, training, or monitoring for a new source.  ROBEDON is the only known source that does not need any time or assistance in learning and understanding the issues since he has first-hand knowledge and intimate familiarity with the history and details of the issues, possesses the ORP corporate knowledge and government employee interactions with ensuring WTP contractor compliance with the contract, and is fully apprised of all the latest information required to perform the tasks.  Furthermore, ORP does not have any available federal staff having the expertise or time to provide orientation or training to bring a new source up to date on the issues and tasks. 
A Description Of Efforts Made To Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From As Many Potential Sources As Is Practical, Including Whether A Notice Was Or Will Be Publicized As Required By Subpart 5.2 And, If Not Which Exception Under 5.202 Applies: Due to the unique nature of this requirement, DOE ORP does not know of, and has not solicited other sources.  Accordingly, a notice of intent to award a sole source contract was publicized as required by FAR Paragraph 5.201(b)(1)(i).  
A Determination By The Contracting Officer That The Anticipated Cost To The Government Will Be Fair And Reasonable: The contracting officer has evaluated the contactor?s price proposal and made a determination that the cost/price is fair and reasonable prior to award.  
A Description Of The Market Research Conducted And The Results Or A Statement Of The Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Due to the unique nature of this requirement, DOE ORP does not know of, and has not solicited other sources.  A notice of intent to award a sole source contract was publicized on FedBizOpps on May 24, 2012, as required by FAR Paragraph 5.201(b)(1)(i). See attached synopsis.  
Any Other Facts Supporting The Use Of Other Than Full And Open Competition: None. 
A Listing Of Sources, If Any, That Expressed In Writing, An Interest In The Acquisition: There we no inquiries or expressions of interest during the 15-day FedBizOpps synopsis period beginning May 24, 2012 and ending June 7, 2012.  
A Listing Of The Actions, If Any, The Agency May Take To Remove Or Overcome Any Barriers To Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition For The Supplies Or Services Required:  DOE ORP will invite potential sources expressing interest in any subsequent requirements to submit statements of capability for review and consideration to determine if they could potentially fill similar requirements in the future.  
Program Official:  I certify that the supporting data which forms the basis for this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Signature on File
Contracting Officer: I certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Signature on File

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.
