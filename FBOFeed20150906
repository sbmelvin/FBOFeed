The research project is titled "Evaluation of Anti-Microbial Protein against Pseudomonas Skin Infections" and it is supported by the Military Infectious Diseases Research Program (MIDRP). The objective of this project is to provide bacterial susceptibility tests of a novel antimicrobial and evaluate the ability to protect the host from terminal Pseudomonas infections using the burned mouse model. Tulane is the only source that can provide the required services in support of this project because the author and Principal Investigator (PI) of this project has the expertise in pelonase and the ideas and objectives written in this project are the intellectual property of the PI.
<p><br />Tulane is the only source that can provide the required services in support of this project. The PI of this project was the scientist and author who submitted a proposal to MIDRP. The funds were accepted, approved and transferred to NAMRU-6 to develop this project between Tulane and NAMRU-6. The PI at Tulane has over 10 years of experience in bacteriology and biochemical purifications. Further, the PI has expertise in pelonase and the ideas and objectives related to this project are the intellectual property of this individual. NAMRU-6 will participate in all phases of the study to include reporting of final results to the MIDRP. Any change in the process to execute this research could compromise the validity of this project. This research will be conducted at Tulane.
